    "pattern": "SELECT <select_parameter> + INTERVAL <interval_parameter>",
    "applied_rules": [
        "<select_parameter>",
        "<interval_parameter>"
    ],
    "Affected Elements": "INTERVAL keyword, arithmetic expressions within INTERVAL",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The function INTERVAL is expecting a single integer value, but the expression (1+2)*3 evaluates to 9, which is not causing the error; the issue arises from the syntax used for INTERVAL with an arithmetic expression instead of a direct integer."
