    "Affected Elements": "LIKE operator, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, SELECT statement",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The inconsistency in results between the materialized table and the view is likely due to the evaluation of the LIKE operator in the context of how data is stored and queried in a materialized table versus a view."
