    "sql": "create or replace function demo(n, z) as table (select list_transform(range(0,n), x -> z) as row); select * from demo(3, 0);",
    "Affected Elements": "Function argument scoping, SELECT clause, list_transform function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The function 'demo' does not properly reference the argument 'z' in its SELECT statement, leading to a binder error due to the absence of 'z' in the FROM clause context."
