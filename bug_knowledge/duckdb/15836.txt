    "sql": "create table abcd (id int primary key); insert into abcd values (1); begin; delete from abcd where id = 1; insert into abcd values (1); commit;",
    "Affected Elements": "DELETE, INSERT, PRIMARY KEY, COMMIT",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The inability to open the database is caused by a constraint violation due to a duplicate primary key entry in the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) file, resulting from the non-checkpointed delete followed by insert operations on the same primary key."
