    "sql": "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE df AS SELECT * FROM range(1_000_000_000); SELECT * FROM df QUALIFY row_number() OVER () < 11; SELECT * FROM df WHERE rowid < 10;",
    "Affected Elements": "row_number() OVER (), rowid, QUALIFY clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of row_number() OVER () incurs significant performance overhead compared to the simpler rowid access method, leading to slower query execution."
