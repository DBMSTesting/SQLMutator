    "sql": "COPY (SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/tmp/data.parquet')) TO '/tmp/data_rewrite_with_size.parquet' WITH (file_size_bytes '512MB');",
    "Affected Elements": "COPY, SELECT, WITH",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The excessive memory usage during the COPY operation with the file_size_bytes option likely stems from the large number of columns being processed, which amplifies memory demands, leading to out-of-memory (OOM) errors."
