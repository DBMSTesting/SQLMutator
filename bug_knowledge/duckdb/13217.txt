    "Affected Elements": "hive_partitioning = true, read_parquet function, wildcard path",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The slower performance is likely due to the overhead of interpreting the hive partitioning logic compared to the direct file path specification, which reduces the number of files the query engine needs to process."
