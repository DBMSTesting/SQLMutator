    "Affected Elements": "INNER JOIN, INTERVAL, WHERE clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The unexpected row count in the first query compared to the second query is likely due to the way the `INTERVAL` values are being compared and filtered, leading to a misunderstanding of how the join condition interacts with the data."
