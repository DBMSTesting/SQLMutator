    "Affected Elements": "SELECT DISTINCT ON, ORDER BY",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The error arises from the misunderstanding of how non-integer literals are treated in the context of the SELECT DISTINCT ON clause, leading to a misleading error message that incorrectly attributes the issue to the ORDER BY clause."
