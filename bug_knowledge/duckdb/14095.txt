    "Affected Elements": "JOIN clause, FETCHDF method, use of wildcards in S3 path, and threading settings",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The slow performance is likely due to the way data is being processed in memory during the JOIN operation, particularly with high column counts and improper handling of concurrency settings."
