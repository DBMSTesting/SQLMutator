    "Affected Elements": "Compound SELECT statement, array_distance function, subquery in SELECT clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue may arise from how the Swift API handles complex SQL queries involving subqueries and aggregate functions, which seems to differ from the handling by views."
