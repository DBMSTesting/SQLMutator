(FORMAT PARQUET, OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE, PARTITION_BY (year, month, day), FILENAME_PATTERN 'test'); COPY (SELECT 1 AS foo, 2024 AS year, 11 AS month, 5 AS day) TO '.'

    "Affected Elements": "COPY statement, FORMAT clause, WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS option",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The COPY command's handling of partitioning fields differs between PARQUET and CSV formats, leading to unexpected inclusion of partition fields when WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS is set to false."
