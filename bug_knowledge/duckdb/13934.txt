    "sql": "SELECT max_by(c0, c1) FROM (VALUES (1, NULL)) AS t(c0, c1);",
    "Affected Elements": "max_by() function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The change in behavior of the max_by() function regarding NULL handling between versions 0.8.1 and 1.1.0 is likely due to a modification in its implementation, resulting in unexpected and inconsistent results compared to prior versions and other SQL engines."
