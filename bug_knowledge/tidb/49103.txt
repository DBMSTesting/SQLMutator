    "sql": "SELECT * FROM chunkCpChan WHERE status = 'active'; UPDATE checkFlushLock SET status = 'locked' WHERE condition = 'forever';",
    "Affected Elements": "SELECT, UPDATE statements, channel operations",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The deadlock occurs due to the failure to close the channel `chunkCpChan` after context cancellation, leading to blocked sends and an engaged lock `checkFlushLock`."
