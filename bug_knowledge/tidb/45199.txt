    "sql": "create table t1(a varchar(100) primary key); create table t2(a varchar(10) primary key); create view v as select a from t1 union select a from t2; explain select * from v where a='test';",
    "Affected Elements": "CAST, UNION, Projection, TableFullScan",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The CAST function which only modifies the length of a string type column leads to an inefficient full table scan instead of utilizing the index, possibly due to improper handling of the type conversion during query execution."
