    "sql": "create table t(a bigint, b bigint, c bigint); with t_cte as (select * from t) select a,b,max(c) from t_cte group by b;",
    "Affected Elements": "WITH clause, GROUP BY clause, nonaggregated columns",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The CTE is not enforcing the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY SQL mode, allowing a query to succeed despite nonaggregated columns in the SELECT list."
