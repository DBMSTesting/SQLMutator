    "Affected Elements": "CREATE INDEX, SPLIT TABLE",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The ADD INDEX operation fails due to the assumption that the startKey and endKey of a region can always be decoded, which is not true for certain cases involving clustered indexes and specific versions of TiDB-Lightning."
