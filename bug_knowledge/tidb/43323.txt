    "sql": "CREATE INDEX idx ON sbtest1 (column_name); ADMIN CANCEL DDL JOBS 95; ADMIN SHOW DDL JOBS 1;",
    "Affected Elements": "CREATE INDEX, ADMIN CANCEL DDL JOBS, ADMIN SHOW DDL JOBS",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The cancellation of the index creation job leads to an inconsistent schema state, causing subsequent attempts to create the same index to fail due to the system incorrectly reporting that the index already exists."
