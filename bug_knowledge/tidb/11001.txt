    "sql": "SELECT PERCENT_RANK() OVER w1 AS percent_rank, fieldA, fieldB FROM ( SELECT pk AS fieldA, col_time_key AS fieldB FROM table50_int_autoinc ) as t WINDOW w1 AS (ROWS BETWEEN 0 FOLLOWING AND UNBOUNDED PRECEDING);",
    "Affected Elements": "WINDOW clause, PERCENT_RANK function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of 'UNBOUNDED PRECEDING' as a frame end is invalid in conjunction with '0 FOLLOWING', leading to an ignored frame clause and incorrect results."
