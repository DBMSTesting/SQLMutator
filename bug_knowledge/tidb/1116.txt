    "sql": "create table t1 (a int not null); insert into t1 values (1); update t1 set a=(select 1);",
    "Affected Elements": "UPDATE statement, subquery in SET clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The update statement attempts to set a non-nullable column to a value derived from a subquery that can potentially return NULL, leading to a violation of the NOT NULL constraint."
