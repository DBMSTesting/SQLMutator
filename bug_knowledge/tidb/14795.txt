    "sql": "create table t (a int, b int, c int, primary key (a, b, c)); explain select * from t where a = 1 and (b, c) in ((1, 1), (1, 2));",
    "Affected Elements": "explain, where, in",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The composite index on (a, b, c) is not being utilized as expected due to the use of the IN clause with multiple columns, leading to a selection that does not leverage the index efficiently."
