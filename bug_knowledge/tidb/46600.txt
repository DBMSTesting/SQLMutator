    "Affected Elements": "INL_JOIN hint, LEFT OUTER JOIN syntax, GROUP BY with non-aggregated expressions",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The usage of the INL_JOIN hint and the GROUP BY clause with a non-aggregated expression is causing performance degradation and incorrect results due to an improper join optimization."
