    "sql": "CREATE TABLE a(b char); SELECT b FROM a UNION SELECT avg(1);",
    "Affected Elements": "UNION, avg() function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue arises from type coercion during the UNION operation, where the result of avg(1) is treated differently in TiDB compared to MySQL, leading to unexpected character types in the result set."
