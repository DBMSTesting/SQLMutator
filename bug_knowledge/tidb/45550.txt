    "sql": "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1; CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 DECIMAL); INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1); SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE NOT (CAST(COS(CAST(1 AS DECIMAL) IS NOT NULL) AS DATETIME));",
    "Affected Elements": "CAST, COS, IS NOT NULL, WHERE clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of the COS function with a boolean expression leads to unexpected results due to type conversion, causing the query to return 1 instead of the expected empty set."
