    "sql": "use test; drop table if exists t; CREATE TABLE `t` ( `COL1` binary(10) NOT NULL ); insert into t values(0x1); select col1 from t union select 1;",
    "Affected Elements": "UNION clause, BINARY data type",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The discrepancy in the result set between TiDB and MySQL is likely due to differences in how binary data is handled during the union operation, leading to incorrect padding or representation of binary values."
