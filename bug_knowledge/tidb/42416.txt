{
    "sql": "SELECT '2023-03-21 12:00:00' + INTERVAL 9 DAY;",
    "Affected Elements": "INTERVAL keyword, arithmetic expressions within INTERVAL",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The function INTERVAL is expecting a single integer value, but the expression (1+2)*3 evaluates to 9, which is not causing the error; the issue arises from the syntax used for INTERVAL with an arithmetic expression instead of a direct integer."
