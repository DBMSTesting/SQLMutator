    "Affected Elements": "OR clause, NULL handling in FLOAT/DOUBLE columns",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The evaluation of the `OR` condition with a NULL value in a FLOAT column leads to unexpected behavior, as NULL is treated as a non-true value, causing the predicate to evaluate to TRUE instead of NULL."
