    "sql": "CREATE TABLE partitioned_table (id INT) PARTITION BY HASH(id) PARTITIONS 10; ALTER TABLE partitioned_table SET TIFLASH REPLICA 1; TRUNCATE TABLE partitioned_table;",
    "Affected Elements": "TRUNCATE TABLE, DDL job handling, write conflict",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The write conflict occurs during the TRUNCATE TABLE operation due to concurrent transactions on a partitioned table with Tiflash replica, leading to DDL job retries."
