    "sql": "DROP TABLE t; CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b INT, INDEX(a)); INSERT INTO t SET a = 123; ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN a; UPDATE t SET b = '18';",
    "Affected Elements": "ALTER TABLE, DROP COLUMN, UPDATE",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The error 'index out of range' suggests that the operation is attempting to reference an index that no longer exists after the column drop, leading to a failure during the subsequent update operation."
