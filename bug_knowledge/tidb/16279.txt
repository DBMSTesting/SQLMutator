    "sql": "create table s(a int); select count(a), date_format(a, '%Y-%m-%d') from s group by date_format(a, '%Y-%m-%d');",
    "Affected Elements": "GROUP BY clause, COUNT function, DATE_FORMAT function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The SQL mode 'only_full_group_by' is enforcing that all selected fields are either aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause, leading to the error when attempting to select non-aggregated fields."
