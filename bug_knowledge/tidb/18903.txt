    "sql": "create table t(a int primary key, b int); create table t1(a int primary key, b int); delete t.* from t join t1 using(a);",
    "Affected Elements": "DELETE statement, JOIN clause, USING syntax",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The error occurs because the SQL engine cannot resolve the column reference during the DELETE operation, likely due to the ambiguity created by the USING clause."
