    "Affected Elements": "FLOAT ZEROFILL, PRIMARY KEY, BIN() function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue arises due to the overflow of float values caused by the interaction between the primary key constraint and the binary representation of the number, leading to unexpected behavior in comparisons."
