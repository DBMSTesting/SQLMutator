    "sql": "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1; CREATE TABLE t1(a BLOB); INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('a'); SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 = a; DELETE FROM t1 WHERE 1 = a; DROP TABLE t1;",
    "Affected Elements": "WHERE clause, comparison operator, BLOB data type",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The DELETE statement fails due to an implicit type conversion issue where the BLOB value 'a' cannot be compared to an integer, resulting in a syntax error for the WHERE clause."
