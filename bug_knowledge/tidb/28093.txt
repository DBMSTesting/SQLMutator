    "sql": "create table t0(a int auto_increment, unique key (a) invisible); show create table t0;",
    "Affected Elements": "CREATE TABLE, UNIQUE KEY, INVISIBLE",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The SQL statement attempts to create a unique key that is marked as invisible, which is not allowed for primary key indexes, leading to a conflict with the expected behavior."
