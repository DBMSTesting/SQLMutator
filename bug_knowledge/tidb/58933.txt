    "sql": "select if((11000>=10000), (floor(11000/10000)), (round(11000/10000,2)));",
    "Affected Elements": "IF function, FLOOR function, ROUND function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The IF function is returning different data types (integer vs decimal) based on the evaluation of its conditions, leading to inconsistent results across MySQL and TiDB."
