    "sql": "SELECT * FROM a JOIN (SELECT * FROM t LIMIT 1) b ON a.c = b.c ORDER BY b.c;",
    "Affected Elements": "JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The panic occurs due to an incorrect handling of the index for b.c when the 'ORDER BY' clause is pushed past the 'JOIN', leading to an invalid execution plan."
