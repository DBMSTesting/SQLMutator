    "sql": "split table t between (0) and (10000) regions 10",
    "Affected Elements": "split, between, regions",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The test case expects the split operation to result in 0 regions being split and 0 regions finishing scatter before the timeout, but the actual result indicates that 10 regions were split, leading to a mismatch in expected and obtained results."
