    "sql": "SELECT tp_int + tp_int FROM t GROUP BY tp_int + tp_int;",
    "Affected Elements": "GROUP BY clause, SELECT list",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The SQL mode `only_full_group_by` requires that all non-aggregated columns in the SELECT list must be functionally dependent on the GROUP BY columns, leading to the error when this condition is not met."
