    "sql": "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t; CREATE TABLE t(a VARCHAR(1000), b VARBINARY(1000)); INSERT INTO t SET a = '12345', b = COMPRESS(a);",
    "Affected Elements": "INSERT INTO, COMPRESS",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The error occurs due to a nil pointer dereference during the execution of the COMPRESS function, likely related to the handling of the column within the expression rewriting process."
