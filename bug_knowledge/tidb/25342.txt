    "sql": "create table t(a int key, b int, c int, index idx(b)); insert into t values(1,1,1); alter table t drop column b; delete from t;",
    "Affected Elements": "delete statement, drop column clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The delete statement fails due to an index column being referenced after it has been dropped, leading to an out-of-bound error."
