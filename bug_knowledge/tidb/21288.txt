    "Affected Elements": "CREATE GLOBAL BINDING, SHOW GLOBAL BINDINGS, SELECT FROM mysql.bind_info, ADMIN RELOAD BINDINGS",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The parallel execution of creating global bindings appears to lead to inconsistent or incomplete state updates in the binding system, resulting in unexpected empty results."
