    "sql": "create table t1(a int primary key, b int, c int, key(b), key(c)); explain select /*+ use_index_merge(t1) */ * from t1 where c=10 or (b=10 and a=10);",
    "Affected Elements": "use_index_merge, where clause with OR condition",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The query fails to find the column 'b' in the schema due to the way the index merge is being utilized with the OR condition."
