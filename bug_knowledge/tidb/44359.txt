    "sql": "CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL); INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (0); SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 > CAST(POW(-0, 1) AS BINARY);",
    "Affected Elements": "POW function, CAST function, comparison operator",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of POW with a negative value leads to unexpected results in the comparison, causing the query to return a value instead of an empty set."
