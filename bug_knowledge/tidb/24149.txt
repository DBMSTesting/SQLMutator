    "sql": "drop table if exists t1; create table t1 (c1 int primary key, c2 int, c3 int, index c2 (c2)); select count(1) from (select count(1) from (select * from t1 where c3 = 100) k) k2;",
    "Affected Elements": "count(1), subquery, where clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The outer count(1) is returning 0 because the inner query does not find any rows where c3 = 100, leading to an incorrect expectation of the result."
