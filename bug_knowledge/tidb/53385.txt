    "Affected Elements": "ALTER TABLE, EXCHANGE PARTITION, REMOVE PARTITIONING",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The removal of partitioning from the table caused the loss of rows that were previously exchanged with the partition, likely due to improper handling of the data after the partitioning was removed."
