    "sql": "CREATE USER 'root'@'127.0.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'notroot'; SHOW GRANTS; SELECT user, host, authentication_string FROM mysql.user WHERE user='root';",
    "Affected Elements": "SHOW GRANTS; SELECT statement;",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The root cause of the issue is that the 'SHOW GRANTS' command does not accurately reflect user privileges based on the combination of user and host, leading to confusion and incorrect privilege information being displayed."
