    "sql": "CREATE TABLE t2 (id VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, a INT); BEGIN; INSERT INTO t2 VALUES ('2', 2); DELETE FROM t2 WHERE id = '2'; COMMIT;",
    "Affected Elements": "DELETE statement with clustered primary key or unique index key in optimistic transactions",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The delete operation does not properly handle the visibility of delete records in the write consistency model, leading to unintended persistence of delete records in the write CF."
