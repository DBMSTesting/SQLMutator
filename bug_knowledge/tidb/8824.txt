    "Affected Elements": "LEFT JOIN, DISTINCT, WHERE clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The presence of the condition 'ud.user_id IS NULL' in a LEFT JOIN context may lead to unexpected results, particularly in the deduplication of joined records, causing incorrect filtering of users without associated departments."
