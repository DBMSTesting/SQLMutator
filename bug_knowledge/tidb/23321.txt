    "sql": "ALTER TABLE your_table_name ADD INDEX idx_name (column_name); DROP INDEX idx_name ON your_table_name;",
    "Affected Elements": "ALTER TABLE, ADD INDEX, DROP INDEX",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The panic in the drop-index logic due to the misused failpoint leads to incorrect handling of the DDL job state, causing a decoding error when the job is processed as a new canceling job."
