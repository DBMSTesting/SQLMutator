    "Affected Elements": "LIKE operator, ORDER BY clause, composite primary key",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The query's performance issue arises from the optimizer's decision to utilize the composite primary key index rather than processing the raw results when the LIKE operator is involved, leading to significant slowdowns."
