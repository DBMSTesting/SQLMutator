    "sql": "CREATE TABLE t0(c0); CREATE INDEX index_0 ON t0(c0) WHERE c0 IS NOT NULL; INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (NULL); SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE c0 IS NOT NULL OR 1;",
    "Affected Elements": "SELECT statement with WHERE clause using OR; partial index creation with WHERE clause; NULL handling in conditions",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The theorem prover incorrectly establishes that c0 is not null when 'c0 OR 1' is true, leading to unexpected results in the query."
