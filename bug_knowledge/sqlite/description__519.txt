    "Affected Elements": "IS NOT NULL constraint, OR-connected terms, unary '+' operator",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The observed bug stems from an interaction between IS NOT NULL constraints and OR-connected conditions, exacerbated by the compilation with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3 or SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4."
