    "Affected Elements": "ORDER BY with BINARY collation, WHERE clause with different collation",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue arises from a conflict between the collation used in the ORDER BY clause and the collation constraints in the WHERE clause, leading to unexpected sorting behavior."
