    "Affected Elements": "DELETE statement with OR in WHERE clause, INTEGER PRIMARY KEY index usage",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The assertion failure occurs due to the interaction between the DELETE operation, the deferred seek of the main table, and the fact that no indexes reference any columns other than the primary key, leading to a failure during the execution of the delete operation."
