    "Affected Elements": "INDEX SCAN, range condition, FORCE INDEX",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The optimizer incorrectly opts for an index scan instead of an index range scan despite the presence of range conditions, leading to poor query performance in scenarios where the buffer pool cannot load the entire table."
