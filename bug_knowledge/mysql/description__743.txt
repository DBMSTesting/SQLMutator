    "Affected Elements": "IN operator, explain statement, multi-column index",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The optimizer is incorrectly estimating row counts for queries with the IN operator, particularly when values in the IN list do not exist in the table, leading to overestimation of expected rows."
