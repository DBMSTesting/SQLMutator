    "sql": "create database test4; create table t1 (c1 int) engine=InnoDB; flush tables with read lock; show processlist; select version();",
    "Affected Elements": "mysqldump, FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The mysqldump command is unable to function correctly under conditions where InnoDB tables are locked by FLUSH READ LOCKS, leading to a stall if long transactions are in progress."
