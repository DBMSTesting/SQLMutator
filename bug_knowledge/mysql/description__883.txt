    "sql": "select enumcol, enumcol + 0 as enumindex from e1 UNION ALL select enumcol, enumcol + 0 as enumindex from e2 order by enumindex;",
    "Affected Elements": "UNION, ORDER BY clause, ENUM data type",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The UNION operation does not preserve the ENUM index, leading to incorrect sorting based on string values instead of index values."
