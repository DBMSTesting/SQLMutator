    "Affected Elements": "BEGIN, DELETE, ROLLBACK, SELECT, EXISTS",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The delete operation in an uncommitted transaction is affecting the visibility of data due to the transaction isolation level (REPEATABLE-READ), which retains the state of the data as it was at the beginning of the transaction."
