    "sql": "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS some_db.some_table; CREATE TABLE some_db.some_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY);",
    "Affected Elements": "DROP TABLE, CREATE TABLE, TIMEOUT, DEADLOCK",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The timeouts experienced during DROP and CREATE TABLE commands are likely due to contention for global schema locks, which can be exacerbated by deadlocks in a distributed NDB cluster environment."
