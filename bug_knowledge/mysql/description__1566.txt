    "sql": "ALTER TABLE information_schema.engines ADD a INT; CREATE INDEX idx ON information_schema.character_sets(character_set_name);",
    "Affected Elements": "ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The assertion failure occurs due to the lack of permission checks on an embedded server, allowing the ALTER TABLE operation to proceed and later trigger an assertion when handling temporary tables."
