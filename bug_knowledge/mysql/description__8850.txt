    "sql": "CREATE SCHEMA `fun`; CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'bob'; DROP USER IF EXISTS 'bob'; CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'bob'; REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON `fun`.* FROM 'bob';",
    "Affected Elements": "REVOKE statement, user privileges, user existence",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The REVOKE statement fails because the user privileges are not recognized after the user has been dropped and recreated, contrary to the expected behavior described in the manual."
