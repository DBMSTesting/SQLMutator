    "Affected Elements": "@@SESSION.GTID_NEXT, @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE, ROLLBACK",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The error occurs because @@SESSION.GTID_NEXT cannot be set to ANONYMOUS when @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE is ON, which leads to issues during replication when the binary log contains a ROLLBACK without data-related events."
