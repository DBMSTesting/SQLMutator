    "sql": "SELECT router_id FROM mysql_innodb_cluster_metadata.v2_routers WHERE address = 'test' AND router_name = 'test';",

    "Root Cause Analysis": "The query incorrectly assumes that 'router_name' is unique without considering 'address', leading to potential reuse of 'router_id' for different routers."
