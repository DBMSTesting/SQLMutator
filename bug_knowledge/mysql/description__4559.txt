    "Affected Elements": "CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, DROP TABLE, FLUSH TABLES, SELECT",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The lockup issue arises from the innodb_lock_wait_timeout being set to 50 seconds, causing threads to wait excessively for locks, especially when multiple threads are trying to access the same resources concurrently."
