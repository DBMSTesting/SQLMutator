    "sql": "create table t1(i int unsigned, j int); create table t3 as select i from t1 union all select null from t1; create table t5 as select null from t1 union all select i from t1;",
    "Affected Elements": "union all, create table, select",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The union operation does not correctly determine the data type of the resulting column when one of the columns is NULL, causing it to incorrectly default to signed instead of unsigned."
