    "Affected Elements": "CREATE TABLE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, DROP TABLE, SHOW TABLES",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The inability to distinguish between temporary and global tables with the same name leads to confusion and potential data loss, as operations may be performed on the unintended table."
