    "Affected Elements": "cur_field, dict_index_is_spatial, page_is_leaf, cmp_spatial_index_nonleaf",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The comparison logic in the spatial index for non-leaf nodes incorrectly handles the mtype for node-ptr fields when primary keys are of non-integer types, leading to unexpected behavior."
