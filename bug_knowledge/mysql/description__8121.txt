    "sql": "drop table if exists t; create table t (a year(4), key(a)); insert into t values (0), (1), (69), (70), (71); select * from t where a not in (70); select * from t where a not in (1, 70); select * from t where a not in (70, 71);",
    "Affected Elements": "NOT IN expression, year(4) type columns",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The inconsistency in the SELECT results when using year(4) type columns in NOT IN expressions is likely due to improper handling of year values in the range of 70-99 and 1-69."
