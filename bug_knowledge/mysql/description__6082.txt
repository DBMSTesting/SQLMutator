    "sql": "insert into bug (approx) select approx as approx1 from (select false as approx) as data on duplicate key update approx=approx;",
    "Affected Elements": "Column 'approx' in field list is ambiguous; ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The ambiguity arises from the reference to 'approx' in the ON DUPLICATE KEY clause, which can refer to either the existing row or the inserted data, but should not refer to columns in the subselect."
