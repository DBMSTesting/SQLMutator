    "sql": "set @a=now(); set @b=NULL; select @a,@b;",
    "Affected Elements": "Variables (@a, @b) and their expected data types (datetime, NULL)",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The MySQL server is incorrectly interpreting the data type of the variable @a as MEDIUM_BLOB instead of datetime, and similarly treating NULL as MEDIUM_BLOB instead of NULL."
