    "sql": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM items WHERE id IN (SELECT iid FROM items_links);",
    "Affected Elements": "SELECT statement with IN clause and subquery",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of the 'id' field in the subquery instead of 'iid' caused incorrect results due to an outer reference in the column selected in the subquery, leading to a mismatch in expected output during semi join optimization."
