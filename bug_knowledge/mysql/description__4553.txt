    "sql": "show variables like 'innodb_file%'; create table `test` (`a` int primary key) engine=innodb row_format=compressed; show warnings; show create table test; show table status like 'test';",
    "Affected Elements": "CREATE TABLE statement, ROW_FORMAT clause, SHOW WARNINGS command",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED with innodb_file_format=Antelope leads to a warning indicating that compression is not supported, resulting in the table being created with ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT instead."
