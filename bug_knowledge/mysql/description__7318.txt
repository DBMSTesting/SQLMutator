    "sql": "mysql --disable-reconnect --sigint-ignore -uroot -h127.0.0.1; select 1;",
    "Affected Elements": "mysql command, signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc.)",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue is likely caused by race conditions in the handling of signals while executing queries, leading to an infinite loop and high CPU usage when the MySQL client attempts to process a query after receiving a disconnect signal."
