    "sql": "CREATE TABLE test_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, large_bit_col BIT(65536)); INSERT INTO test_table (id, large_bit_col) VALUES (1, b'1');",
    "Affected Elements": "BIT data type, column length specification",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The bug is caused by the limitation of the row's null bits array, which cannot accommodate large BIT fields exceeding 8160 bits, leading to insert failures."
