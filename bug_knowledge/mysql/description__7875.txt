    "sql": "CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT, c1 INT UNIQUE); INSERT INTO t0(c1) VALUES(1); SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE t0.c1 BETWEEN 0 AND ('\n2');",

    "Root Cause Analysis": "The presence of a newline character in the string causes unexpected behavior with the BETWEEN comparison, particularly when a UNIQUE constraint is present."
