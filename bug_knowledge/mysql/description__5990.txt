    "sql": "CREATE TABLE T1 (a1 CHAR(8) PRIMARY KEY); CREATE TABLE T2 (a2 CHAR(8)); ALTER TABLE T2 ADD CONSTRAINT fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (a2) REFERENCES T1(a1);",
    "Affected Elements": "CHAR datatype in foreign key constraints",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The foreign key constraint creation fails due to a regression in MySQL Workbench affecting CHAR types, which worked fine in version 6.3.4 but not in versions 6.3.5 and above."
