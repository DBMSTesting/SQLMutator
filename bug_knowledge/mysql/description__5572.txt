    "sql": "drop table if exists t1; create table t1(c1 int, c2 int); insert into t1 values(1,1),(2,0),(1,3); select 1 as c3, c1 as c3, c2 as c3 from t1 group by c3; select c1 as c3, c2 as c3, 1 as c3 from t1 group by c3;",
    "Affected Elements": "GROUP BY clause, aliasing with the same name",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The ambiguity in column 'c3' arises from using the same alias for multiple columns in the SELECT statement, which causes confusion during the GROUP BY operation."
