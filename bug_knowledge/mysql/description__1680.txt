    "Affected Elements": "DELETE statement, correlated subquery, ON DELETE CASCADE clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The foreign key constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE is causing deletions to be processed row-by-row, leading to incorrect evaluation of the correlated subquery during the deletion operation."
