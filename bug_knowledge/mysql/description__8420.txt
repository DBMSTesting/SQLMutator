    "Affected Elements": "stop slave; start slave;",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The error ER_MTS_INCONSISTENT_DATA(1756) is caused by the slave coordinator's inability to properly manage the event timing and acknowledgment of transactions in a multithreaded replication environment, particularly when the stop slave command is issued before the previous transactions are completely processed."
