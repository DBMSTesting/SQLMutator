    "sql": "DELETE FROM `application` WHERE id = 2; SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE id = 3;",
    "Affected Elements": "FOREIGN KEY constraints with conflicting ON DELETE actions (ON DELETE CASCADE vs ON DELETE SET NULL)",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "MySQL does not handle multiple foreign key constraints referencing the same table with conflicting delete actions correctly, leading to unexpected behaviors on delete operations."
