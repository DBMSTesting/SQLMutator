    "Affected Elements": "DELETE, INNER JOIN, MRG_MyISAM, AUTO_INCREMENT, TRIGGER",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The crash occurs when a combination of replication and multi-table DELETE statements with triggers is executed in specific MySQL versions, likely due to changes in alias resolution and handling of AUTO_INCREMENT fields."
