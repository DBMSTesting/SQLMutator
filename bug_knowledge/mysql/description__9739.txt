    "sql": "CREATE TABLE t0 (c1 INT, CONSTRAINT k0 PRIMARY KEY (c1)); ALTER TABLE t0 DROP CONSTRAINT k0;",
    "Affected Elements": "CONSTRAINT, PRIMARY KEY",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The primary key constraint is being created with a user-defined name ('k0'), but the system is not recognizing it when attempting to drop the constraint, indicating a potential issue with how MySQL handles named constraints."
