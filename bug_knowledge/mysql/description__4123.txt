    "sql": "CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT) ENGINE=InnoDB; CREATE TABLE t2 (i INT) ENGINE=InnoDB; START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT; SELECT * FROM t1; INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1); RENAME TABLE t2 TO t3; SELECT * FROM t3;",
    "Affected Elements": "START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT, RENAME TABLE, SELECT",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The inconsistent isolation of transactions from concurrent RENAME TABLE operations leads to a situation where a consistent snapshot does not accurately reflect the state of the database."
