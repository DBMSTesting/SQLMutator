    "sql": "create table t1 (a int, b int, c int, unique key idx_2(b,c)); begin; insert into t1 values(1, 'A'); insert into t1 values(2, 'B'); commit; select * from t1; alter table t1 add primary key (a);",
    "Affected Elements": "auto_increment, primary key, unique key",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "Adding an auto_increment primary key to a table without initially defining one leads to inconsistent data between master and slave in replication due to the order of insertion not being preserved."
