{
    "sql": "CREATE TABLE test (id int not null primary key, type int not null); CREATE INDEX idx ON test (id, type); DELETE FROM test WHERE type=5 OR (type=3 AND id=123456);",
    "Affected Elements": "DELETE statement, OR clause in WHERE",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The DELETE statement does not utilize the index effectively due to the order of columns in the index and the nature of the OR condition, leading to performance issues."
