    "Affected Elements": "topKWeightedMergeState, initializeAggregation, arrayJoin, range",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The assertion failure in the HashTable indicates that the function attempted to emplace a zero value into a non-zero expected location, likely due to the presence of 'nan' in the input causing unexpected behavior."
