    "sql": "SELECT sum(q0.a2) AS a1, sum(q0.a1) AS a9 FROM (SELECT 1 AS a1, 2 AS a2) AS q0;",
    "Affected Elements": "Unknown identifier in aggregate function 'sum(a1)'",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of the same alias 'a1' in different levels of the query leads to ambiguity in the aggregate function, causing the 'unknown identifier' error."
