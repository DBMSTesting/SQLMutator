    "sql": "WITH 1 AS a, 2 AS b SELECT multiIf(a * (b IS NULL), 0, a * b) AS c;",
    "Affected Elements": "multiIf function, condition clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The function multiIf requires the condition to be of type UInt8, but the expression 'a * (b IS NULL)' results in an illegal type UInt16."
