    "sql": "SELECT *, if((number % 2) = 0, 0.5, 1) AS a, 30 AS b, sum(a * b) OVER (ORDER BY number ASC) AS s FROM numbers(10)",
    "Affected Elements": "if, sum, OVER, ORDER BY",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue arises from the interaction of the `optimize_arithmetic_operations_in_aggregate_functions` setting with the use of window functions and non-aggregated columns in the SELECT statement, leading to a syntax error regarding aggregation rules."
