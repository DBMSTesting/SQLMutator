    "sql": "select co, co2, co3, count(*) as num from (select 1 as co, 2 as co2, 3 as co3) group by cube(co, co2, co3) having co != 0 and co2 != 2;",
    "Affected Elements": "group by cube, having clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The discrepancy in results between the two queries arises from the use of the WHERE clause in the first query, which filters rows before the aggregation, while the HAVING clause in the second query filters after aggregation, leading to different outcomes."
