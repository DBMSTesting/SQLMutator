    "sql": "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_view; CREATE VIEW test_view AS SELECT COUNT(*), database, table FROM system.columns GROUP BY database, table; SELECT * FROM test_view ORDER BY table;",
    "Affected Elements": "DROP TABLE, CREATE VIEW, SELECT",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The deadlock occurs due to concurrent access to the same table/view being dropped while simultaneously querying it, causing contention between the DROP and SELECT operations."
