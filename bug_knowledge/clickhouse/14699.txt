    "sql": "SELECT * FROM (SELECT rand() AS rand_value FROM numbers(1)) AS subquery WHERE NOT ignore(rand_value);",
    "Affected Elements": "SELECT, WHERE, ignore() function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The use of 'ignore(*)' in conjunction with 'rand()' in the WHERE clause leads to missing column errors due to the optimizer not recognizing 'rand()' as a valid column in the context."
