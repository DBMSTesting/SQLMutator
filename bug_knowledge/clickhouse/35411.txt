    "Affected Elements": "SELECT, virtual columns (_path, _file)",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The bug appears to originate from a change in the handling of virtual columns in the S3 table function between ClickHouse versions 22.2.2.1 and 22.3.2.2, which is causing the system to not recognize the '_path' and '_file' columns as valid inputs."
