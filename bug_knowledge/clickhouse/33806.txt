    "sql": "RESTORE REPLICA 'replica_name';",
    "Affected Elements": "RESTORE REPLICA, is_readonly, has_metadata_in_zookeeper",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The underlying issue is that the state of the 'has_metadata_in_zookeeper' variable does not correctly reflect the existence of metadata in Zookeeper, leading to incorrect error handling during the RESTORE REPLICA operation."
