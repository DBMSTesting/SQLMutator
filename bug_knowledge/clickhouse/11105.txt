    "Affected Elements": "LIKE clause",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The issue occurs because the `LIKE` operator is being applied to NULL values, which results in unexpected behavior, as `LIKE` cannot match NULL values, causing the query to return more NULL values than expected. This issue arises due to improper handling of NULL values within the `LIKE` clause."
