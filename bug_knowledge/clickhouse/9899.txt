    "sql": "SELECT hostName() AS h, count() FROM distributed GROUP BY h;",
    "Affected Elements": "hostName() function, count() function",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "The query fails because the count() function is being used without an argument, which leads to the absence of the column `hostName()` in the result set, causing errors during execution."
