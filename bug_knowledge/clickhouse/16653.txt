    "Affected Elements": "ORDER BY clause with LowCardinality column as the first ordering column or in the middle",
    "Root Cause Analysis": "Ordering by a LowCardinality column as the first key in a composite order causes incorrect row arrangement due to the way LowCardinality handles string uniqueness."
