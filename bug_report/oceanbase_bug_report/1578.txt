Title: [Bug]: Incorrect 'Lock Waiting Timeout' Message for DML Statement Timeout
Description:
**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of bug. -->
I set the variable ob_trx_lock_timeout to -1 (indicating no timeout during lock wait) within a session and encountered a situation where a DML statement within that session's transaction was blocked by another transaction. 
Subsequently, the DML statement produced an error: "ERROR 1205 (HY000): Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction." However, I had previously configured the system for no lock wait timeouts, and this error should have indicated a statement execution timeout (the variable ob_query_timeout defaults to 10 seconds).

 I believe there is an incorrect error message in this context.
