Title: [Question]: Developer documentation is unclear in `Get the code, build and run` chapter
Description:
**Question**
I thick the documentation maybe unclear in `Get the code, build and run` chapter, link is as follows: https://oceanbase.github.io/oceanbase/build-and-run/

In my environment, the port is not 10000 but 11000, it  is not consist with the documentation as follows:
<img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8531112a-70a7-4aea-b8df-70b1f60ed4e1">
And i checkout the `obd.sh` script,  found the following line:
```bash
 port_gen=$((100*($(id -u)%500)+10000))
```
I thick maybe the port is not fixed at 10000, but in this chapter,  it is not mentioned, so maybe it should be more precise:).
