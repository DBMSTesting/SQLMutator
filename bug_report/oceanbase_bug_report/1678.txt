Title: [Bug]: SQL Simplification for the SQL Query  [ISSUE #1131]
Description:
### SQL Simplification for the SQL Query  [ISSUE #1131]

**Environment:**

- OceanBase_CE Version: 4.0.0.0 (r1-c36622e1c881c561d583e6138d4fe2c6ad32a413)
- Operating System: Linux version 3.10.0-1160.76.1.el7.x86_64
- Client: obclient Ver Distrib 10.4.18-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1

**Original reproduce step:**

```
CREATE TABLE v0 ( v1 INT, v2 INT , v3 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (1, 2, 3);
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (3, 2, 1);
CREATE TABLE v4 ( v5 INT, v6 INT , v7 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (4, 5, 6);
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (6, 5, 4);
SELECT DISTINCT v3 FROM v0 WHERE v3 IN ( ( SELECT v1 FROM ( WITH v1089 AS ( SELECT v3 FROM v0 ) SELECT v1 FROM ( SELECT v2 , ( v3 = 38 OR v3 > 'x' ) FROM v0 WHERE v3 > 58 OR v1 > 88 AND v3 < ( SELECT v6 FROM v4 AS v1090 GROUP BY v7 + -128 , v5 ) ) AS v1091 NATURAL JOIN v0 ) AS v1092 GROUP BY v1 HAVING v1 = ( SELECT v5 FROM v4 WHERE 'x' / v6 = v6 + CASE v7 WHEN TRUE THEN ( ( ( EXISTS ( SELECT 7 ) AND ( ( v5 % ( SELECT v1 FROM v0 UNION SELECT v5 FROM ( SELECT v5 FROM ( WITH v1096 AS ( SELECT v5 FROM ( SELECT v5 FROM v4 WHERE FALSE WINDOW v1094 AS ( PARTITION BY v7 ) ) AS v1095 ) SELECT DISTINCT v5 , ( v5 = 127 OR v5 > 'x' ) FROM v1096 ) AS v1097 NATURAL JOIN v4 WHERE v5 WINDOW v1098 AS ( PARTITION BY v5 ) ) AS v1099 ORDER BY v1 IN ( - 64 , ( v3 % ( SELECT v2 FROM v0 UNION SELECT TRUE FROM v0 AS v1093 ORDER BY v2 LIMIT 1 ) AND 49 ) ) ASC LIMIT 1 ) <= v6 OR NOT v5 ) ) ) BETWEEN 84 AND 16 ) ) ELSE 2147483647 END OR v5 = v6 ) * 51 ) ) ;
```

**Minimal reproduce step:**

```
CREATE TABLE v0 ( v1 INT, v2 INT , v3 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (1, 2, 3);
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (3, 2, 1);
CREATE TABLE v4 ( v5 INT, v6 INT , v7 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (4, 5, 6);
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (6, 5, 4);
SELECT DISTINCT v3 FROM v0 WHERE v3 IN (SELECT v1 FROM  v0   
HAVING v1 = (SELECT v5 FROM v4 WHERE v6 = CASE v7 WHEN TRUE THEN ((SELECT v1 FROM v0 UNION SELECT v5 FROM v4 ORDER BY v1 IN (SELECT v2 FROM v0))) ELSE 2147483647 END));
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The original query was significantly longer and more complex; it was simplified for ease of debugging and readability.
- The simplified version of the query continues to cause the observer to crash, indicating a fundamental issue in query processing.

Could you please confirm whether the simplification process we applied has been helpful for developers in diagnosing and addressing this issue?
