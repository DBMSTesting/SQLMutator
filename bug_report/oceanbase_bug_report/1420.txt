**Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)**
1. run some stress test on oceanbase mysql tenant. like  tpc-c or tpc-h
2. collect performance metrics about cache from both gv$sysstat and  __all_virtual_kvcache_Info using obagent , prometheus and grafana.
3.  view the graphs about metris about cache_hit of some caches in grafana. 
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
