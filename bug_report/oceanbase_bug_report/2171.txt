**Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)**
1、合并
2、全备
3、增备
4、增备
在这期间不执行插入修改删除等写数据的操作。
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
增备结果集大小和全备结果集大小基本一致
**Expected behavior**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
增备结果集大小和全备结果集大小应该相差较大才对
**Actual Behavior**
<!-- What is the result? picture is allowed -->
增备结果集大小和全备结果集大小基本一致
**Additional context**
<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->

**Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)**
1. Merge
2. Completely prepared
3. Additional reserves
4. Additional reserves
During this period, data writing operations such as inserting, modifying, and deleting are not performed.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
The size of the supplementary result set is basically the same as that of the full result set.
**Expected behavior**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
There should be a big difference between the size of the incremental result set and the size of the full result set.
**Actual Behavior**
<!-- What is the result? picture is allowed -->
The size of the supplementary result set is basically the same as that of the full result set.
