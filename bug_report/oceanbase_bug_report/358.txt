### What changes were proposed in this pull request?
1.修复利用 alter table 语句创建外键时发生失败后无法 retry 的 bug
2.将外键的约束修改为与 mysql 一致。在 mysql 中，若主键或唯一索引由n 列构成，则其允许外键references的列数为 m ( m <= n )。mysql 仅要求外键reference的列的顺序与主键或唯一索引的顺序一致，不要求外键的列的数量与reference的主键或唯一索引一致。
    示例：
          create table t1(c1 int, c2 int, primary key(c1, c2));
          create table t2(c1 int, c2 int, foreign key(c1) references t1(c1) on delete cascade);
          --error
          create table t2(c1 int, c2 int, foreign key(c1) references t1(c2) on delete cascade);
          --error
          create table t2(c1 int, c2 int, foreign key(c1,c2) references t1(c2,c1) on delete cascade);
