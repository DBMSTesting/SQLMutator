Title: [Bug]: invalid log print in ob_memtable_context.cpp
Description:
**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of bug. -->
When print `char*` value in the log, it trait the value as a c-string.
We cannot print `buf` in fill_redo_log@ob_memtable_context.cpp as a c-string as it is a binary buffer.

Use `KP` is better.
