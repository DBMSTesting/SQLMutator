Title: [Bug]: Inconsistent Query Results Between Views and Materialized Tables with Logical Comparison
Description:
**Describe the bug**
In OceanBase, Queries involving logical comparisons and JSON data return inconsistent results when executed on a view versus a materialized table. Specifically, the query on the materialized table (t1) returns 2 rows, while the equivalent query on the view returns 3 rows. 

**Environment**
- OS Version and CPU Arch(`uname -a`):
```
[root@332f4c044dbb ~]# uname -a
Linux 332f4c044dbb 5.15.49-linuxkit-pr #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu May 25 07:27:39 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
```
  
- OB Version:
 ```
obclient [oceanbase]> select version();
+------------------------------+
| version()                    |
+------------------------------+
| 5.7.25-OceanBase_CE-v4.2.1.9 |
+------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.002 sec)
```

**Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create table t0 and insert data
CREATE TABLE t0 (c0 SMALLINT, c1 TINYINT, c2 JSON, c3 BIT);
INSERT INTO t0 (c0, c1, c2, c3) VALUES 
    (19845, 43, '"C"', 1),
    (30886, -65, '"x"', 0),
    (25357, -124, '"I"', 0),
    (-7265, -53, 'true', 1);

-- Step 2: Create materialized table t1 and query it
CREATE TABLE t1 AS (
    SELECT (c0 <= c1) AS c0, c2 AS c2, c3 AS c3 
    FROM t0
);

obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT c3, c2 FROM t1 WHERE ((c2 != (c0)) != (c3 OR '[[]]')) ORDER BY c3 ASC, c2 DESC;
+------+------+
| c3   | c2   |
+------+------+
|      | "x"  |
|      | "I"  |
+------+------+
2 rows in set, 2 warnings (0.012 sec)

-- Step 3: Create view t1 instead and query
CREATE VIEW t1 AS (
    SELECT (c0 <= c1) AS c0, c2 AS c2, c3 AS c3 
    FROM t0
);

obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT c3, c2 FROM t1 WHERE ((c2 != (c0)) != (c3 OR '[[]]')) ORDER BY c3 ASC, c2 DESC;
+------+------+
| c3   | c2   |
+------+------+
|      | "x"  |
|      | "I"  |
|     | true |
+------+------+
3 rows in set, 2 warnings (0.008 sec)
```

**Expected behavior**
Both queries on the materialized table and the view should yield identical results.

**Actual Behavior**
Query on the materialized table (t1) returns 2 rows, and query on the view (t1) returns 3 rows.
