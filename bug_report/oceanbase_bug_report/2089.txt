Title: [Bug]:  服务器核过多，导致obv3.1.5无法启动 || [Bug]: There are too many server cores, causing obv3.1.5 to fail to start.
Description:
**Describe the bug**

我的服务器有320个核，无法启动obv3.1.5，当我把核降低到256后，可以启动，因此怀疑是配置问题。在网上搜索，如果是商业版，可以通过调整_ob_max_thread_num参数来支持多核，因此想知道，开源版该如何调整该参数，我试过在yaml上增加该参数，但似乎没有效果，我尝试在代码中寻找该参数，也未找到该参数。

**Describe the bug**

My server has 320 cores and cannot start obv3.1.5. When I lower the core to 256, it can start, so I suspect it is a configuration problem. Searching on the Internet, if it is a commercial version, you can support multi-core by adjusting the _ob_max_thread_num parameter, so I would like to know how to adjust this parameter in the open source version. I have tried increasing this parameter in yaml, but it seems to have no effect. I tried in the code The parameter was searched for and was not found.
