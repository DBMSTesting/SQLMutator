### A full description of the feature and provide some example if the same feature exists in other products, such as mysql

```markdown
I have created the same table in OB and mysql.


CREATE TABLE users1 ( id bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, age bigint(20) NOT NULL, name varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unknown', PRIMARY KEY (id) ) DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_bin;
```

Then I found that the information_schema is not compatible with MySQL/MariaDB.

I executed this sql to get information_schema:

```
SELECT `TABLE_NAME`, `COLUMN_NAME`, `COLUMN_TYPE`, `COLUMN_COMMENT`, `IS_NULLABLE`, `COLUMN_KEY`, `COLUMN_DEFAULT`, `EXTRA`, `CHARACTER_SET_NAME`, `COLLATION_NAME`, NULL AS `GENERATION_EXPRESSION` FROM `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`COLUMNS` WHERE `TABLE_SCHEMA` = 'test' AND `TABLE_NAME` = 'users1' ORDER BY `ORDINAL_POSITION`;
```

In MySQL and MariaDB, The CHARACTER_SET_NAME column exists for string types and should be NULL for both id and age in my case above. At the same time the CHARACTER_SET_NAME column is binary for both id and age in OB.
```
