Title: [Bug]: Incompatible result with MySQL
Description:
**Describe the bug**

**Environment**

- OS Version and CPU Arch(`uname -a`):

```bash
Linux 3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Jun 4 14:43:51 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

- OB Version(`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./observer -V`):

```bash
select version();
-- 5.7.25-OceanBase_CE-v4.3.4.0
```

**Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t0(c0 DOUBLE) ;
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES(0.48419657580314157);
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE (NOT (CAST(t0.c0 AS DOUBLE) <= (CAST(t0.c0 AS FLOAT))));
```

**Expected behavior**

I find that the query in OceanBase is inconsistent with MySQL 8.4.1

```sql
// MySQL
MySQL [test]> SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE (NOT (CAST(t0.c0 AS DOUBLE) <= (CAST(t0.c0 AS FLOAT)))); 
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

**Actual Behavior**

```sql
// OceanBase
MySQL [test]> SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE (NOT (CAST(t0.c0 AS DOUBLE) <= (CAST(t0.c0 AS FLOAT))));
+---------------------+
| c0                  |
+---------------------+
| 0.48419657580314157 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
