2.create table a new table named by `t1;`  using session1 still:
mysql> create table `t1;` like t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
or
create table `t1;`(id bigint ,name varchar(10));

4.If step3 succeeded,then type 'show tables;', and errors were posted.
mysql> show tables;
ERROR 2014 (HY000): Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now

In V3.1.3,error can be like this:
mysql> show tables;
ERROR 2006 (HY000): MySQL server has gone away
