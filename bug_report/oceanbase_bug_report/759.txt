Title: dereference null pointer
Description:
https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/blob/24d4669c242418ebe972f01f900fd6f9a0622271/src/storage/ob_multiple_multi_scan_merge.cpp#L191-L242
in line 234, I meet segment fault.
in line 231. I think if branch should be `(OB_ISNULL(iter = iters_.at(tables.count() - 1 - i)))`?

Maybe the bug description is call virtual function on null pointer rather than dereference null pointer.
