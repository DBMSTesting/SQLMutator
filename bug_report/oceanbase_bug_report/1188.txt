Title: [Bug]: Docker image cannot correctly set the environment parameters
Description:
### Please check the issue list for the same bug

- [X] Please checked issue list and confirm this bug is encountered for the first time.
- [X] Please try full text in English and attach precise description.

### Environment

```markdown
The latest docker image in https://hub.docker.com/r/oceanbase/oceanbase-ce

[root@centos7 ~]# docker images
REPOSITORY               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
oceanbase/oceanbase-ce   4.0.0.0   4f6db39e42d4   28 hours ago    457MB
```


### Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)

Create a docker container with following command.

```shell
docker run --name observer --network=host -e MINI_MODE=1 -e OB_ROOT_PASSWORD='pswd' -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce:4.0.0.0
```

### Actual Behavior

The password of 'root@sys' is still empty.

### Expected Behavior

The password of 'root@sys' should be 'pswd'.

### other information

I found that there was no `root_password` field in the generated yaml file.
