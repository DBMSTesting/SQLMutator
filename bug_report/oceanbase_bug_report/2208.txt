Steps to reproduce the behavior:

**Expected behavior**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
Following the steps in the above snatshot, in step 4, the check of whether agg_ is a NULL pointer means the agg_ could potentially be a NULL pointer.  But in NDEBUG mode, the OB_ASSERT is void function and cannot ensure that agg_ is not NULL. In the path that agg_ is a NULL pointer,  the NULL DEFERENCE(空指针解引用) error is generated in step 12.
