### What changes were proposed in this pull request?
1. 上报不带rootserver的observer节点使用的sys  unit 资源
2. oceanbase.__all_virtual_server_stat 中展示的数据，将会包含invisible sys unit resource(使用配置项控制_report_invisible_sys_unit_resource）
3. ob_heartbeat.cpp 中上报的心跳信息，也增加了invisible sys unit resource(使用配置项控制）
4. 增加升级脚本，在升级后，可以自动检测当前系统是否所有节点，都能够容纳下invisible sys unit resource，如果是，那么会自动打开配置项_report_invisible_sys_unit_resource，否则使用默认值为FALSE

下面是附带的两个小BUG：
5. 修改一个单元测试脚本的BUG：wait_daily_merge.inc 在执行结束时不能打开日志
6. 修复test/README.md 中的描述错误
