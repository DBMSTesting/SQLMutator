Title: [Bug]: In file ob_lob_access_utils.cpp, K(buf) in logging statement is invalid
Description:
**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of bug. -->
`K(buf)` in the log statement will print `buf` as a zero terminated string, but `buf` is not a C-string.

In file `src/share/ob_lob_access_utils.cpp`, `K(buf)` should be instead with `KP(buf)`.
