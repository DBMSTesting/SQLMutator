### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Add an if statement to call the destructor while memcpy is not safe in the pop_back() function of ObSEArrayImpl.

This PR solve the [issue](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/issues/316)


### Why are the changes needed?

Class T may allocate memory in heap in its constructor, if so, `is_memcpy_safe()` will return false. In this case, we should call the destructor of T in the pop_back() function of `ObSEArrayImpl` same as the `pop_back(T& obj)` function of `ObSEArrayImpl`. If not so, there may be risk of memory leaks.


### Will break the compatibility? How if so?

No.


### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

No
