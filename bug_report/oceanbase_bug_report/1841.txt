OceanBase use `fallocate with zero range` to reuse the log blocks, but it doesn't support this feature on linux 3.10.

Solution:
We can test if `fallocate with zero range` is supportted when the process starting.
If not, we can use `pwrite` instead of `fallocate`.
This solution will slow down the performance, so the performance data should be provided in the pull request.
