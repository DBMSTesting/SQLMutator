Title: [Bug]: SQL Simplification for the SQL Query  [ISSUE #1123]
Description:
### SQL Simplification for the SQL Query  [ISSUE #1123]

**Environment:**

- OceanBase_CE 4.0.0.0 (r1-c36622e1c881c561d583e6138d4fe2c6ad32a413)
- Linux version 3.10.0-1160.76.1.el7.x86_64
- obclient  Ver  Distrib 10.4.18-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1

**Original reproduce step:**

```
CREATE TABLE v0 ( v1 INT, v2 INT , v3 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (1, 2, 3);
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (3, 2, 1);
CREATE TABLE v4 ( v5 INT, v6 INT , v7 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (4, 5, 6);
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (6, 5, 4);
SELECT v1175 , CASE WHEN CASE NOT ( NOT ( v3 = 'x' AND v1 = 'x' AND v1175 = 'x' ) ) IS NULL WHEN ( v1175 IN ( ( SELECT v3 FROM ( SELECT v3 FROM v0 UNION SELECT v1 FROM ( SELECT v1 % ( v1 = 16 AND 95494434.000000 ) ^ 8 FROM v0 UNION SELECT v3 FROM v0 ) AS v1167 ) AS v1168 WINDOW v1172 AS ( PARTITION BY v3 ORDER BY ( SELECT DISTINCT 127 FROM v4 AS v1169 , v4 AS v1170 , v0 AS v1171 JOIN v0 ) DESC ) ORDER BY TRUE BETWEEN ( ( ( SELECT v1 * 24 + v3 FROM v0 WHERE v1 IN ( 88 , 43 ) ) = 84 ) ) AND ( CASE v3 WHEN ( v3 IN ( 29 , 49 , 97 , 49 , 'x' / v3 = v3 + CASE v3 WHEN TRUE THEN 90 ELSE -1 END OR v3 = v3 OR v3 = TRUE ) ) THEN 0 ELSE -128 END != 63 ) ) , 43 , -1 , 2 , 'x' / v3 = v6 + CASE v1175 WHEN TRUE THEN 74 ELSE 83 END OR v3 = v6 OR v1175 = v6 ) ) THEN -32768 ELSE 90 END THEN ( 84 * v1175 ) ELSE v1175 ^ v3 % 51298332.000000 END AS v1173 , v1 * 255 AS v1174 FROM ( SELECT ( SELECT v7 FROM v4 WHERE v5 = 255 AND v6 = 16 GROUP BY v6 ) AS v1175 FROM v0 UNION SELECT v2 FROM v0 ) AS v1176 NATURAL JOIN v4 AS v1177 NATURAL JOIN v0 ;
```

**Minimal reproduce step:**

```
CREATE TABLE v0 ( v1 INT, v2 INT , v3 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (1, 2, 3);
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (3, 2, 1);
CREATE TABLE v4 ( v5 INT, v6 INT , v7 INT) ;
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (4, 5, 6);
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (6, 5, 4);
SELECT v1175 IN ((SELECT v3 FROM (SELECT v3 FROM v0 UNION SELECT v1 FROM v0) ORDER BY 1 BETWEEN (((SELECT v1 FROM v0 WHERE v1 IN (88)))) AND (CASE v3 WHEN (true) THEN 0 ELSE -128 END ))) FROM (SELECT 1 AS v1175);
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The original query was significantly longer and more complex; it was simplified for ease of debugging and readability.
- The simplified version of the query continues to cause the observer to crash, indicating a fundamental issue in query processing.

Could you please confirm whether the simplification process we applied has been helpful for developers in diagnosing and addressing this issue?
