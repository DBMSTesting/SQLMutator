Title: [Bug]: 动态内存一致性检测，observer可以启动，但无法连接，并且/data目录下没有日志 || [Bug]: Dynamic memory consistency detection, the observer can be started, but cannot be connected, and there are no logs in the /data directory
Description:
**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of bug. -->

我们使用对二进制文件插桩的方式，对ob进行动态内存一致性检测，当我们使用工具启动observer后，会报ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on '192.168.0.214' (115) 这个错误，看起来是observer未正常启动。

我们首先使用obd start集群，然后kill掉observer，然后使用工具启动observer的方式来进行内存一致性检测，


**Environment**
<!-- Environment Details sometimes important -->
- OS Version and CPU Arch(`uname -a`):
  
- OB Version(`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./observer -V`):
  
arm 环境

希望能正确启动，或者能出现错误日志信息，目前是在启动之后，没有任何报错或者其他的日志信息

**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of bug. -->

We use binary file instrumentation to perform dynamic memory consistency detection on ob. When we use the tool to start the observer, ERROR 2002 (HY000) will be reported: Can't connect to MySQL server on '192.168.0.214' (115 ) This error seems to be that the observer did not start normally.

We first use obd start cluster, then kill the observer, and then use tools to start the observer to detect memory consistency.


**Environment**
<!-- Environment Details sometimes important -->
- OS Version and CPU Arch(`uname -a`):
  
- OB Version(`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./observer -V`):
  
arm environment

I hope it will start correctly or error log information will appear. Currently, after startup, there are no errors or other log information.
