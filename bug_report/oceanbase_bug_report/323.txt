Title: Call recovery_point_data_mgr_.destroy() in ObPGStorage
Description:
### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Call recovery_point_data_mgr_.destroy() in ObPGStorage

### Why are the changes needed?

If we don't call `recovery_point_data_mgr_.destroy()` in `ObPGStorage.clear()`, the `file_handle_` in `ObRecoveryDataMgr` won't reset. Then we free the `ObStorageFile` in `ObStorageFileWithRef`, then `~ObRecoveryDataMgr()` will be automatically called by `~ObStorageFile()`, `~ObRecoveryDataMgr()` will try to reset `ObStorageFileHandle`. However `file_with_ref_` in its `ObStorageFileHandle` has already been freed. In this case, the program will crash.


### Will break the compatibility? How if so?

No.

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

No.
