### Environment

```markdown
- OB Version:
Server version: 5.7.25 OceanBase 3.1.4 (r10000092022071511-b4bfa011ceaef428782dcb65ae89190c40b78c2f) (Built Jul 15 2022 11:45:14)

mysql> SELECT VERSION();
+--------------------+
| VERSION()          |
+--------------------+
| 3.1.4-OceanBase CE |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

- Hardware parameter:
OS: Ubuntu 18.04; CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230R CPU @ 2.10GHz
```


### Fast Reproduce Steps(Required)

```sql
drop table if exists t;

create table t ( c1 float );

insert into t values (2),(-0.0001),(-9.183);


(SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE COT(0.2)=0) UNION ALL (SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t); -- original sql

(SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE 1 ) UNION ALL (SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t); -- mutated sql1

(SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE 0 ) UNION ALL (SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t); -- mutated sql2
```

### Actual Behavior

```sql
mysql> (SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE COT(0.2)=0) UNION ALL (SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t); -- original sql
+------+
| 1    |
+------+
|    2 |
|    0 |
|    0 |
+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> (SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE 1 ) UNION ALL (SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t); -- mutated sql1
+----------------------+
| 1                    |
+----------------------+
|                    1 |
|                    1 |
|                    1 |
|                    2 |
|                    0 |
| 18446744073709551607 |
+----------------------+
6 rows in set, 2 warnings (0.01 sec)

mysql> (SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE 0 ) UNION ALL (SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t); -- mutated sql2;
+----------------------+
| 1                    |
+----------------------+
|                    2 |
|                    0 |
| 18446744073709551607 |
+----------------------+
3 rows in set, 2 warnings (0.01 sec)
```

### Expected Behavior

In theory，`mutated result2` ⊆ `original result` ⊆ `mutated result1`

However, as you can see, the third value `0` in `original result` changed to `18446744073709551607` in `mutated result1` and `mutated result2`.


### other information

If you only execute the query on the right side of `UNION ALL`, you will get the following result:
```sql
mysql> SELECT (BINARY c1 | 0) FROM t;
+----------------------+
| (BINARY c1 | 0)      |
+----------------------+
|                    2 |
|                    0 |
| 18446744073709551607 |
+----------------------+
3 rows in set, 2 warnings (0.01 sec)
```
Is there some problems with `UNION ALL`?
