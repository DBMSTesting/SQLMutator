Title: BR-restore should still perform checksum even when the schema checksum is missing
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Perform `br backup full --checksum=0`
2. Perform `br restore full --checksum=1`

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

BR restore compare the `ADMIN CHECKSUM` with the sum of crc64xor of all files, which are always computed in `br backup` regardless of original `--checksum`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

BR restore does not compare the checksum because it used the Schema's crc64xor which are not populated without `--checksum=1`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.5 and above
