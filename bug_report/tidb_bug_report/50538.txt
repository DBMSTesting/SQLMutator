Title: disttask: do not view normal nodes as background nodes when all background nodes fail
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Now, we have A, B, C, D, E TiDB:
- normal: A, B, C
- background: D, E

In distributed framework tasks, there are two case to execute task:
1. we use the background nodes for background tasks
2. If all nodes are normal, then all nodes will be used for background tasks. 

Therefore, when D and E crash, the background tasks that were supposed to be executed by D and E will be assigned to A, B, and C instead. This is an unexpected behavior.


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

If a background has been set for a node and the node crashes, the second case will not take effect. In this situation, if the user still wants the second case to take effect, they can modify the role of the crashed node to empty on distributed_framework_meta.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
