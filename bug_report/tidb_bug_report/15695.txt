### 1. What did you do?
set the chunk size to 2 like https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/15696

download the file with all DDLs 
[randgen_index_merge_join.txt](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/files/4381467/randgen_index_merge_join.txt)
```
source randgen_index_merge_join.txt
```
```
SELECT /*+INL_JOIN(table1,table2,table3,table4,table5,table6,table7,table8,table9,table10,table11,table12)*/ distinct table1 . `col_int_key` AS field1 FROM   BB AS table1  LEFT  JOIN M AS table2 ON  table1 . `pk` =  table2 . `col_int_key`   LEFT  JOIN  M AS table3  LEFT  JOIN Y AS table4 ON  table3 . `col_varchar_10_utf8_key` =  table4 . `col_varchar_10_latin1`  ON  table2 . `col_int_key` =  table4 . `col_int_key`  WHERE table2 . `col_int_key` IS  NULL  GROUP BY field1  ORDER BY field1   ;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?
Mysql
```
+--------+
| field1 |
+--------+

|      8 |
|      9 |
+--------+
11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead?
```
