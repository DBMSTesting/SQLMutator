Title: txn: unexpected behavior for point-get and `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Using `LOCK IN SHARED MODE` in a point-get query:

```
set @@tidb_enable_noop_functions='OFF';
create table t(a int key, b int);
insert into t values (1, 1), (2, 2);
select * from t where a=1 lock in share mode;
select * from t where b=1 lock in share mode;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

According to [TiDB document](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/pessimistic-transaction), TiDB should report an error using `SHARE IN LOCK MODE` when `tidb_enable_noop_functions=OFF`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
tidb> select * from t where a=1 lock in share mode;
+---+------+
| a | b    |
+---+------+
| 1 |    1 |
+---+------+
1 row in set (5.80 sec)

tidb> select * from t where b=1 lock in share mode;
ERROR 1235 (42000): function LOCK IN SHARE MODE has only noop implementation in tidb now, use tidb_enable_noop_functions to enable these functions
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

All versions of TiDB have this issue, I believe.

### 5. Root cause analysis

Notice that for `select * from t where a=1 lock in share mode`, TiDB uses a 'fast path' for point-get, we didn't handle `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in this path.
