Title: incorrect column value of type `year` for zero input
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

From TiDB:
```
mysql> create table tbl(a year(4));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.13 sec)

mysql> insert into tbl values(0);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from tbl;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| 2000 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into tbl values('0');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from tbl;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| 2000 |
| 2000 |
+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

2. What did you expect to see?

From MySQL:
```
mysql> create table tbl(a year(4));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> insert into tbl values(0);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from tbl;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| 0000 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into tbl values('0');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from tbl;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| 0000 |
| 2000 |
+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

3. What did you see instead?

Incompatible behavior with MySQL. According to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/two-digit-years.html:
> For YEAR, the rules are the same, with this exception: A numeric 00 inserted into YEAR(4) results in 0000 rather than 2000. To specify zero for YEAR(4) and have it be interpreted as 2000, specify it as a string '0' or '00'.

We need to handle this exception.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select version();
+--------------------------------------+
| version()                            |
+--------------------------------------+
| 5.7.10-TiDB-v2.1.0-rc.3-175-gf7d8ca6 |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
