Title: MAX_EXECUTION_TIME behavior differences from MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

MAX_EXECUTION_TIME was recently added in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/7008
I noticed a few behavior differences from MySQL.

2. What did you expect to see?

TiDB supports `set max_execution_time=1000;`, but does not support using this as a hint. This is important for languages such as Go, where connection pools (unless using a transaction) may share connections between gorountines. Thus, setting a session var is unreliable:

```
tidb> select /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000) */ SLEEP(5);
+----------+
| SLEEP(5) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+
1 row in set (5.00 sec)

mysql80> select /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000) */ SLEEP(5);
+----------+
| SLEEP(5) |
+----------+
|        1 |
+----------+
1 row in set (1.00 sec)
```

The second issue is that when interrupting a sleep'ed query, MySQL will just have the sleep function return 1. TiDB instead returns an error:

```
tidb> set max_execution_time=100;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

tidb> SELECT SLEEP(10);
ERROR 1317 (70100): Query execution was interrupted

mysql80> set max_execution_time=100;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql80> select sleep(10);
+-----------+
| sleep(10) |
+-----------+
|         1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.10 sec)
```

A third issue is that the setting the global var did not work as expected:
```
morgo@ryzen:~/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb$ mysql -e 'set global max_execution_time=100'
morgo@ryzen:~/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb$ time mysql -e 'select sleep(10)'
+-----------+
| sleep(10) |
+-----------+
|         0 |
+-----------+

real    0m10.010s
user    0m0.005s
sys     0m0.000s

(Creating a new connection does show max_execution_time as 100, but this is not taking effect.)
```

A fourth issue is that the sleep function does not seem to cancel/interrupt. The query still runs for 60 seconds, even though it is only supposed to run for 100ms (this is different from 3rd issue, note the error message):

```
morgo@ryzen:~/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb$ time mysql -e 'set max_execution_time=100;select sleep(60)'
ERROR 1317 (70100) at line 1: Query execution was interrupted

real    1m0.010s
user    0m0.005s
sys     0m0.000s
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
