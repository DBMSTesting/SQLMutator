Title: TiDB cannot support carriage characters(\r) in SQL statements
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
I query this SQL in navicat:
```
SELECT count(1) from my_order
-- select * from my_order
where order_no='1015240524'
```

In fact, there is a hidden carriage return at the end of the annotated line.
The result I expect is a query with a where condition, but in fact I count the whole table.

I found the SQL text executed by tidb in the log:
```
[sql="select count(1) from my_order\n-- select * from my_order\rwhere order_no='1015240524'"]
```
Should the `\r` be parsed as a newline?

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
result by where query

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
whole table scan

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v5.1.0
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
