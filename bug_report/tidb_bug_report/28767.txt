## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a int) FOLLOWERS=4;
ERROR 1105 (HY000): failed to notify PD the placement rules: "[PD:placement:ErrBuildRuleList]build rule list failed, needs at least one leader or voter for range {7480000000000000FF5000000000000000F8, 7480000000000000FF5100000000000000F8}"
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

This should work. It implies there is a leader, and now 4 followers with no constraints.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Error

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```sql
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
