### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Look, we did add a unique index with ddl job id as 1131, while at 02.19 ddl owner has changed, and resume the checkpoint at same time, consequently leading duplicate entry error at 02.21

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
no duplicate error (since user has checked with their data)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master, 7.1.1
