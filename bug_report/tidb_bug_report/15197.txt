Title: transaction limit is different between `insert` and `delete` statements
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

create a table:
```sql
create table t(a varchar(2000), b varchar(2000));
```

insert into lots of values into this table:
```sql
insert into t values(space(2000), space(2000));

-- repeat the following sql to insert data into table t
insert into t select * from t;
```

when reach the transaction limit, continue to insert into some data:
```sql
-- reached the transaction limit:
TiDB(root@127.0.0.1:test) > insert into t select * from t;
ERROR 8004 (HY000): Transaction is too large, size: 104858403

-- continue inserting into this table:
insert into t select * from t limit 10000;
insert into t select * from t limit 10000;
insert into t select * from t limit 10000;
insert into t select * from t limit 10000;
```

now delete from this table:
```sql
delete from t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?

the above `delete` statement should exceed the transaction limit and failed

### 3. What did you see instead?

but it successed :joy: :
```sql
TiDB(root@127.0.0.1:test) > delete from t;
Query OK, 72768 rows affected (4.44 sec)
```

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
âžœ ./bin/tidb-server -V
