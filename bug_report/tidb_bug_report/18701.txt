Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
- create a cluster with two tiflash nodes
- scale in a tiflash node
- run the sql: `select count(1) from tiflash_segments` or `select count(1) from tiflash_tables`

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The sql returns result normally.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The sql meets error: connection refused.

### 4. Affected version (Required)
v4.0.3

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->

### 5. Root Cause Analysis
The system table fetchs tiflash node info from etcd, and the info remains valid for a short time when tiflash node is down. So tidb will send query to the the tiflash node which is down and get a connection refused error.
