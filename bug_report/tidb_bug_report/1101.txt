Title: TiDB sql query cost raise problem.
Description:
For a test sql query, it costs 800ms after the system just started. But a day later, it rises to several seconds. 
The operation is only ddl reload schema, including the schema version and the ddl owner key get.  Seems there are some problems in TiDB/TiKV. We should find and fix the bug.
