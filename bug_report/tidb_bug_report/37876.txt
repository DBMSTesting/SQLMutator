Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Schema change on a global temporary table may happen during a transaction that writes to the temporary table. Unlike normal tables, the transaction won’t overwrite other transactions, so it’s fine to commit.
