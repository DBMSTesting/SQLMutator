Title: Unexpected results caused by column pruning rules
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do?
Run SQLs like the following:
```
mysql> select 1 from (select sleep(1)) t;
```


2. What did you expect to see?
```
mysql> select 1 from (select sleep(1)) t;
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (1.00 sec)
```

3. What did you see instead?
```
mysql> select 1 from (select sleep(1)) t;
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
Notice the execution time, `sleep(1)` is not executed.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
```
sh> tidb-server -V
