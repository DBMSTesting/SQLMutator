Title: store/tikv: LockTTL may be smaller than DefaultLockTTL
Description:
In a recent CI failure, we got a lockTTL less than DefaultLockTTL

```
FAIL: lock_test.go:214: testLockSuite.TestLockTTL

lock_test.go:220:
   c.Assert(l.TTL, Equals, defaultLockTTL)
... obtained uint64 = 0x1
... expected uint64 = 0x3
```

In this test the default lock TTL is set to 3, but got one.

This is caused by https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/tikv/2pc.go#L170

When transaction size is not greater than txnCommitBatchSize, lockTTL is zero, it adds a duration at the end of the function.
