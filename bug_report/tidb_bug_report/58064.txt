Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
create table `t0` (`c1` int,`c2` varchar(255));
insert into `t0` values (1,'a'),(2,'d'),(3,'c');

create table `t0_oracle1` (`c1` int,`c2` varchar(255)) partition by hash(c1) partitions 96;
insert into `t0_oracle1` values (1,'a'),(2,'d'),(3,'c');

select `t01`.`c1`,`t01`.`c2`,`t01`.`c3` from (select `t1`.*,@`c3`:=@`c3`+1 as `c3` from (select  `t0`.*,@`c3`:=0 from `t0` order by  `t0`.`c1`) as `t1`) as `t01` where `t01`.`c3`=2 and `t01`.`c2`='d';
select `t01`.`c1`,`t01`.`c2`,`t01`.`c3` from (select `t1`.*,@`c3`:=@`c3`+1 as `c3` from (select  `t0_oracle1`.*,@`c3`:=0 from `t0_oracle1` order by  `t0_oracle1`.`c1`) as `t1`) as `t01` where `t01`.`c3`=2 and `t01`.`c2`='d';
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Queries return same result

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```sql
mysql> select `t01`.`c1`,`t01`.`c2`,`t01`.`c3` from (select `t1`.*,@`c3`:=@`c3`+1 as `c3` from (select  `t0`.*,@`c3`:=0 from `t0` order by  `t0`.`c1`) as `t1`) as `t01` where `t01`.`c3`=2 and `t01`.`c2`='d';
+------+------+------+
| c1   | c2   | c3   |
+------+------+------+
|    2 | d    |    2 |
+------+------+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select `t01`.`c1`,`t01`.`c2`,`t01`.`c3` from (select `t1`.*,@`c3`:=@`c3`+1 as `c3` from (select  `t0_oracle1`.*,@`c3`:=0 from `t0_oracle1` order by  `t0_oracle1`.`c1`) as `t1`) as `t01` where `t01`.`c3`=2 and `t01`.`c2`='d';
Empty set (0.01 sec)
```
The result of the second query is unstable.
