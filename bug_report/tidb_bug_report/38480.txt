Title: The pollTiFlashReplicaStatus loop may be costy when a table has many regions
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
`GetTiFlashPDRegionRecordStats` will collect all region data from pd, which may be costy, when it brings many data.
We may have some ways to alleviate:
1. Make PollTiFlashInterval/PollTiFlashBackoffMaxTick configurable
2. Increate PollTiFlashBackoffMaxTick
