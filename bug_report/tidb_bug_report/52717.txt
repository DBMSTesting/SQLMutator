Title: BR compatible with InfoSchemaV2
Description:
## Modification List

InfoSchema V2 feature issue: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50959

1. Deprecate `(*Meta).ListTables`. It is called from `br/pkg/stream/stream_mgr.go:buildObserveTableRanges` to build log task ranges.
2. Don't upload entire table infos when start a log backup task. Done by https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/54421
3. PITR restore and full restore checks whether there are user tables by calling `GetExistedUserDBs`. Switch to use a more efficient function.
4. Use `(infoschema.InfoSchema).SchemaTables` to get system tables instead of `DBInfo.Tables`. It's OK because the number of system tables is very small.
5. Maybe the cost of scanning the entire tables is very high, so `IngestRecorder` currently only search tables by table id of the recorded ingest index.
