## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

- deploy a cluster on Azure with `tiup cluster`
- visit dashboard -- cluster diagnose
- start a diagnose job
- view full report
- check `Cluster Hardware` database table

### 2. What did you expect to see?

- The `DISK(GB)` column of TiFlash in the report should be the same with PD's since this two VMs have the same configration
- TiFlash disk info in `Cluster Hardware` database table should be also the same with PD's

### 3. What did you see instead?

- in the report, TiFlash disk column is empty
