Title: Incorrect Results by `REGEXP`
Description:
## Bug Report

Inconsistent results by `REGEXP`.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (0.01);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0;

SELECT * FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN v0 ON DEFAULT(t0.c0); -- (NULL|0}
SELECT (v0.c0)REGEXP(v0.c0 AND t0.c0) FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN v0 ON DEFAULT(t0.c0); -- {1}
SELECT * FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN v0 ON DEFAULT(t0.c0) WHERE (v0.c0)REGEXP(v0.c0 AND t0.c0); -- Empty set
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The first `SELECT` returns non-empty results and the predicate `(v0.c0)REGEXP(v0.c0 AND t0.c0)` is evaluated `TRUE` in the second `SELECT`, but the third `SELECT` returns nothing. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
