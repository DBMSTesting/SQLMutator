Title: Lack of the check when we use expression evaluation in some executors
Description:
## Bug Report

### Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!
In some [executors](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/expression/expression.go#L327), it will use the [`VecEval`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/expression/expression.go#L468) when they want to evaluate expressions. But we need to do some checks to chose whether it can use the `VeclEval` or `Eval`.

### What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
