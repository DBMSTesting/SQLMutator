Title: TTL job hangs in running state after decreasing `tidb_ttl_delete_worker_count`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
set @@global.tidb_ttl_scan_batch_size=500;
set @@global.tidb_ttl_delete_batch_size=1;
set @@global.tidb_ttl_delete_rate_limit=1;
set @@global.tidb_ttl_delete_worker_count=2;
create table ttl1(t timestamp) TTL=`t`+interval 1 minute ttl_job_interval='1m';
insert into ttl1 values(now() - interval 1 day);
insert into ttl1 select * from ttl1; -- repeat many times
```

Then wait ttl job is running, after ttl job is running do:

```
set @@global.tidb_ttl_delete_worker_count=1;
```

Wait ttl job finished.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The TTL job will finally finish.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The TTL job will never finish because some task is always in running state:

```
> select * from mysql.tidb_ttl_task\G
***************************[ 1. row ]***************************
job_id             | 70a857793b0e4296975fe8f695cb05d5

status_update_time | 2024-08-21 15:02:47
state              | {"total_rows":32766,"success_rows":32368,"error_rows":1,"scan_task_err":""}
created_time       | 2024-08-21 15:02:47
1 row in set
```

You can see that `total_rows(32766) > success_rows(32368) + error_rows(1)`. The task will only seen as finished when they are equal.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
