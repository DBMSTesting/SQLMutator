Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

TiKV config file is following:

```toml
[resolved-ts]
advance-ts-interval = "10s"
```

Then start the TiDB cluster and execute following SQL, then observe the grafana metrics.

```sql
set config tikv `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval`="5s";  -- This is worked.

-- wait 5 minutes, to observe grafana metric.

set config tikv `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval`="2s"; -- This doesn't worked.
```

metrics:

#### root cause analyze

The [PR](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/14123/files#diff-f86dc21a7845465caa70ed3ebe51652da2bb799b200680dd5f210701bb0c96d9R101) introduce a `min advance-ts-interval` which is `5s`,  so modify `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval` from `5s` to `2s` is not work.


<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

After discussing with @overvenus, we think the minimal value of config `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval` should be `5s`, so change the config to `2s` should return error, such as:

```
Error: invalid config, the minimal value of 'resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval' is '5s'
```

Also when start TiKV, tikv-server need to validate the config value of `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval`, which should more than `5s`.


#### other

At present, we think that the minimum value of config `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval` is 5s. If some scenarios cannot be met, we should discuss the minimum value of this configuration again.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Execute following SQL success but doesn't work.

```sql
set config tikv `resolved-ts.advance-ts-interval`="2s";
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

v6.5.5
