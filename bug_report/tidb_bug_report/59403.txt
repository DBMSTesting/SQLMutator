This time analyze the memory usage after the workload is gone.

I suspect there is a leak, after the workload gone, the memory usage is still there:

As you can see the CPU is 0%, but at time 15:45, the memory usage is high.
And after a privilege full reload (the spike), the memory usage finally decreased.

Here is the mem profile before and after the full reload:

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The memory usage should reduce after the workload is gone like after.pb.gz
