Title: Text column can be used in index without key length
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (k varchar(10) primary key, v int);
alter table t change column k k tinytext;
show create table t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

`alter table ...` should failed with `1170, "BLOB/TEXT column 'k' used in key specification without a key length"`

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

All statements succeeded. `show create table t` prints as following
```sql
CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `k` tinytext NOT NULL,
  `v` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`k`) /*T![clustered_index] NONCLUSTERED */
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin
```

Note that the `CREATE TABLE ...` statement will be rejected by both tidb and mysql. It may affect some backup/restore tools.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master
