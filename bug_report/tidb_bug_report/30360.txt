Title: GetExplainRowsForPlan called twice for the same query
Description:
## Bug Report

When profiling a `SELECT * FROM partitioned_table` I found that GetExplainRowsForPlan was called twice and took about 25% of the time when executing the query.

I wonder if it is even needed to call at all, since the plan is already stored, and could possibly be extended with `GetExplainRowsForPlan` when needed by `EXPLAIN FOR ...`

Found when first hacking out/disable reArrangeFallback in #30353 to see what else could be made faster.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
create table tp (a int primary key, b varchar(255)) partition by hash (a) partitions 8192;
insert into tp values (1, 'row with id 1, partition p1 filler data'), (2, 'partition p2, filler data for row with id 2'), (9, 'filler data for row with id 9, partition p9');
-- start profiling and run this over and over again for profiling:
select * from tp;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

`GetExplainRowsForPlan` to be called once, or not at all, except when `EXPLAIN FOR...` would be called.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

`GetExplainRowsForPlan` was called twice per query.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
