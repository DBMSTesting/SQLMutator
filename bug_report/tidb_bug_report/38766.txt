Title: `tidb_constraint_check_in_place_pessimistic` should not be global scope, and should not affect internal sessions
Description:
## Enhancement
Changing this variable can lead to unexpected results. Internals sessions shouldn't be affected by it as well, e.g. the imeplementation of `get_lock()` depends on `tidb_contraint_check_in_place_pessimistic=1`to work.
We should only allow sessions that are aware of its effects use it.
