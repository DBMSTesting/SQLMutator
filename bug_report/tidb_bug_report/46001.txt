Title: Scatter region should check success status 
Description:
## Bug Report
For BR or using the `tidb_scatter_region` variable, we need to check the success status of the scatter operator. When we create a table, if the region is just splitted, the size might be the original region's size/n, which could not be less than 1. So PD will regard those regions as non-empty regions. Then they might be filtered by store limit.
But BR and client-go will think the scatter region succeeds since they are not in running status but cancel status.
