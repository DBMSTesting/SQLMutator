1. What did you do?

```
DROP TABLE if exists t1, t2;
CREATE TABLE t1 (c VARCHAR(30), INDEX ix_c (c(10))) charset utf8mb4;
CREATE TABLE t2 (d VARCHAR(10)); 
INSERT INTO t1 (c) VALUES ('7_chars'), ('13_characters'); 

SELECT (SELECT SUM(LENGTH(c)) FROM t1 WHERE c='13_characters') FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t2 (d) 
  SELECT (SELECT SUM(LENGTH(c)) FROM t1 WHERE c='13_characters') FROM t1;

INSERT INTO t2 (d) 
  SELECT (SELECT SUM(LENGTH(c)) FROM t1 WHERE c='7_chars') FROM t1;

ANALYZE table t1, t2;

SELECT (SELECT SUM(LENGTH(c)) FROM t1 WHERE c IN (SELECT t1.c FROM t1)) 
FROM t1;
```


2. What did you expect to see?
