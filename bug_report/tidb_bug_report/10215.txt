## Description

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

Theoretically, `count(distinct JSON_cols)` may have the same problem with https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/10099 as https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/10107#discussion_r274246685 mentioned.

I did not build a case to trigger this successfully. Need more investigations.
