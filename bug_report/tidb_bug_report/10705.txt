mysql> create user 'xxx'@'%';                                                                                                                                                                       
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> grant all privileges on *.* to 'xxx'@'%';                                                                                                                                                    
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '%-xxx' for key 'PRIMARY'
```

2. What did you expect to see?

Success

3. What did you see instead?

Fail

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

2.1, 3.0, master ... all of them

----------------

Just like DDL, `create user` `grant xxx` should begin a new transaction
