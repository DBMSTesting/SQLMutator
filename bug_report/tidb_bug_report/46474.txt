Title: plan replayer cannot handle a standard zip file contains directories.
Description:
A normal zip archive stores both files and directories as entries. For example, a zip contains only a file `schema/some.sql` will also contain "schema/", which is a directory entry.

So if someone decompressed the zip provided replayer and compress it again, TiDB will not be able to read it. (But luckily, most zip readers are able to read the zip provided by TiDB. They are good at handling corner cases :facepalm:  ).
