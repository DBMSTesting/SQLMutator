Title: Unable to adjust the reorganization parameters of ddl jobs
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

Previously, we could use the global variables `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` and `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size` to adjust concurrency and batch size. However, after #55334, these configurations can no longer be modified dynamically. As a result, certain DDL jobs may take excessive time to complete or consume too many resources, impacting overall business performance. To mitigate these issues, itâ€™s crucial to have control over the configuration of individual DDL jobs to prevent adverse effects on the system as a whole.
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Run a huge reorg job such as add index. I want to speed it up or reduce the impact on the system.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
But there is no method to control.
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
There are some methods can be used to adjust the ddl.
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
