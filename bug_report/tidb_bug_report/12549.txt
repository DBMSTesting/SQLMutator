Title: planner: index look join doesn't treat inner table as partition table correctly
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

In `constructInnerIndexScanTask`, it does not set `isPartition` and `physicalTableID` in `PhysicalIndexScan`, so index look join doesn't treat inner table as partition table correctly.

2. What did you expect to see?

index look join treats inner table as partition table correctly.

3. What did you see instead?



4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
