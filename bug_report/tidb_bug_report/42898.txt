Title: NgMonitoring not started yet.
Description:
## Bug Report

NgMonitoring not started yet.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

I am using TiDB v6.5 and have deployed a cluster consisting of 3 TiDB nodes, 5 TiKV nodes, 1 PD node, and 1 monitoring node. Initially, I deployed the monitoring node separately and encountered an error message stating that 'NgMonitoring not started yet.' When I attempted to manually start ngmonitoring, I received the error message shown in the provided screenshot.

I have verified that the pd_servers setting in ngmonitoring.toml is configured with the addresses of other nodes, but the error message indicates that it is accessing 127.0.0.1. I suspect that there might be an issue with the configuration file not being read correctly.

To verify this issue, I redeployed the TiDB cluster and colocated the monitoring node with the PD node. I then manually started ngmonitoring, and it was successful. I suspect that there might be a problem with the configuration file not being read correctly, and that ngmonitoring was not started when Prometheus was started.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Based on the above, I believe there is an issue with the configuration file reading and ngmonitoring is not self-starting in TiDB v6.5.0, or perhaps the method I am using is incorrect.
