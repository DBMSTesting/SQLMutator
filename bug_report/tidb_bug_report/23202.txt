Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
**The case is that when add index takes a long time, the user manually canceled the DDL job, so the add index logic will be converted to drop index logic.**

**Once there is a panic in the path of canceling, the goroutine will be pulled up and set its state as canceling again, which is a dead loop.**

**We should count the error count when the goroutine being pulled up from a panic.**

Reproduce step:
```
mock a panic in function `dropIndexColumnFlag`
alter table t drop index  
loop...
```
