Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
The SQL statement to generate sequence:

```
select @NUM := @NUM + 1 as NUM from (
select 1 union all select 2 union all select 3 union all select 4 union all select 5 union all
select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9 union all select 10
 ) a inner join (
select 1 union all select 2 union all select 3 union all select 4 union all select 5 union all
select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9 union all select 10
 ) b, (SELECT @NUM := 0) d;
```

2. What did you expect to see?
MySQL:
+------+
| NUM  |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
.....
|   99 |
|  100 |
+------+
100 rows in set (0.08 sec)

MySQL version: Server version: 5.7.21 MySQL Community Server (GPL)
