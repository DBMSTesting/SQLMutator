Title: BR - S3 Endpoint is not set when get bucket informations
Description:
## Bug Report

Hi,

We get following error when we try to backup our TiDB on s3 :

`Error: s3 bucket and region are not matched, bucket=ringover-eu-2023, input region=fr-par, real region=us-east-1`

After checking the code, i think it's because the endpoint is not set when calling `GetBucketRegionWithClient` here : https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/br/pkg/storage/s3.go#L374

My guess is that you need a `WithEndpoint` when creating `aws.Config` there : https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/br/pkg/storage/s3.go#L357

You can check this comment in AWS SDK : https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/main/service/s3/s3manager/bucket_region.go#L91

### Use BR to backup DB

Try to backup with BR and specify a endpoint : 

`tiup br backup full --pd "$PDIP:$PDPORT"  --s3.endpoint "https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/" -s "s3://bucket1/TEST1" --s3.region "fr-par" --send-credentials-to-tikv=true --ca "$CAFILE" --key "$KEYFILE" --cert "$CERTFILE"`

This is the cli we use, the "bucket1" exists and the region `fr-par` is the good one, you can see the result of an aws cli call : 
 
`$ aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket bucket1 --profile scw
{
    "LocationConstraint": "fr-par"
}`

### Backup is on S3

### The backup fails

We get following : 
`Error: s3 bucket and region are not matched, bucket=ringover-eu-2023, input region=fr-par, real region=us-east-1`

The region returned is not the same than the provided in cli because the endpoint is not set

### TiDB 6.5

Everything works well before 6.5

regards
