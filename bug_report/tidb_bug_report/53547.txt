Title: `upper(c1) <=> c1` evaluates to 0 unexpectedly
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
create table t2 (c1 text);
insert into t2 values ('abc');
select upper(c1), upper(c1) <=> c1 from t2;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The column `upper(c1) <=> c1` should be 1:
```
mysql> select upper('abc') <=> 'abc';
+------------------------+
| upper('abc') <=> 'abc' |
+------------------------+
|                      1 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
But TiDB output 0.
```
mysql> select upper(c1), upper(c1) <=> c1 from t2;
+-----------+------------------+
| upper(c1) | upper(c1) <=> c1 |
+-----------+------------------+
| ABC       |                0 |
+-----------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### about us
We are the BASS team from the School of Cyber Science and Technology at Beihang University. Our main focus is on system software security, operating systems, and program analysis research, as well as the development of automated program testing frameworks for detecting software defects. Using our self-developed database vulnerability testing tool, we have identified the above-mentioned vulnerabilities in TiDB that may lead to database logic error.
