Title: Wired casting when left join a table with JSON_EXTRACT column
Description:
## Bug Report

**a_table**:
|id  |
|---|
|00000e94-b6ff-4380-97f3-3cc2178eb099 |

**b_table**:
|id  |   |
|---|---|
|1  |{"userId": "00000e94-b6ff-4380-97f3-3cc2178eb099"}|

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
select a_table.id
from
a_table
left join
(select 
      JSON_EXTRACT(b_table.json_data, '$.userId') AS user_id
from
      b_table
where xxxxx
      ) as b
on b.user_id = a_table.id;
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)


table a and b will be joined on `VARCHAR` type id.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)


```
Invalid JSON text: The document root must not be followed by other values.
```


The plan seems wired, it will try to build the following column to left join `JSON_EXTRACT(b_table.json_data, '$.userId') AS user_id`
```
cast(a_table.id, json BINARY)->Column#31
```
I think that is why will throw the error.

When I modify it to:

```sql
select a_table.id
from
a_table
left join
(select 
      JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(b_table.json_data, '$.userId') AS user_id)
from
      b_table
where xxxxx
      ) as b
on b.user_id = a_table.id;
```

It will be right.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

TIDB-6.5

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
