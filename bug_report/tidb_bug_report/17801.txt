## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

On this page: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/sql/character-set/

It says "Currently, TiDB supports the following character sets:" (includes latin1).

### 2. What did you expect to see?

I think it is more accurate to say TiDB only supports ascii + utf8 character sets, since utf8 is a super set of ascii but not of latin1 (aka iso8859). Then "for compatibility latin1 is included in the results of meta data commands".

For example, [consider this bug](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/13870) when trying to use a valid latin1 character:

```
set names latin1;
create table tc(a varchar(20) charset latin1);
insert into tc values (BINARY(X'A5'));
select * from tc
```

In MySQL, the yen character(¥) displays correctly. The character is is in latin1, but not in ascii.

### 3. What did you see instead?

```
mysql> select * from tc;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| �     |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
