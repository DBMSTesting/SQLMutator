Title: bootstrap version is not correctly incremented
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

From code inspection of bootstrap.go, I can see a bug introduced in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/33094

Version 85 is introduced, but the `currentBootstrapVersion` is still on version 84:

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/c4fbc8e4afa9493789109247e609912e53b7db3e/session/bootstrap.go#L588-L590

Without this, the code won't run.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

version 85.

master
