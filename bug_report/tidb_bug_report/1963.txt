Title: plan: fix a panic bug when involved join and order by.
Description:
Consider the query:
`select * from a join (select * from t limit 1) b on a.c = b.c order by b.c`
the final plan will be Join{table(a), table(b)->Projection->Limit->Order by b.c} -> Projection.
Firstly, we calucate the b.c's index as 1. When we push "order by" past join, we should update b.c's index to avoid panic.
