Title: Support for 32-bit architectures
Description:
go-mysql uses github.com/pingcap/tidb/pkg/parser and this doesn't build on 32-bit architecures.

Note that fixing some of these issues would be good anyway. But the focus should be the parser. And I don't think this is ever going to be a supported architecture for TiDB so the priority is low.

> Hello, I'm one that cares :) @xhebox 
> [go-mysql](https://github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql), which has tidb as a dependency, fails to build on 32bit archs.
> 
> Here's one of our [goreleaser failed actions](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-mysql/actions/runs/13312008116/job/37176673456) as an example.

> We'll build for 64bit archs for now, not really a blocker, but would be nice to support 32bit.
