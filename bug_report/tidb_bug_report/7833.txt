Title: DROP VIEW IF EXISTS causes server crash (breaking mydumper)
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

myloader tries to drop a table as both a view and a table when restoring with the `-o` option (overwrite).  It crashes tidb, which I managed to reduce to this test case:

```
MySQL [test]> CREATE TABLE t1 (a int);
DRQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.53 sec)

MySQL [test]> DROP VIEW IF EXISTS t1;
ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query
```

2. What did you expect to see?

Not crash.

3. What did you see instead?

See above.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
MySQL [test]> select tidb_version()\G
