Title: Lightning duplicate detection does not set service GC safepoint
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
- In the current lightning implementation, we only set service GC safepoint when doing checksum. But we also need to set service GC safepoint if duplicate detection is enabled.
- When duplicate detection is enabled, we should also set proper session variables to avoid evaluate expression panic.
