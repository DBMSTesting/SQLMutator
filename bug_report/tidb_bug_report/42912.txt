Title: Unexpected result of subquery
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Consider the following program:

```
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 TEXT(328) );

CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT 'c' FROM t0;

INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (-12);

SELECT v0.c0 AS c0 FROM  v0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0  WHERE (1 !=((v0.c0)REGEXP(-7)));  -- empty

SELECT COUNT(v0.c0) AS c0 FROM v0 WHERE EXISTS(SELECT v0.c0 AS c0 FROM v0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0  WHERE (1 !=((v0.c0)REGEXP(-7))));  -- 1
```
The first query produce empty result, I put the first query in an `EXISTS` expression, which should be equals to `FALSE`, but the second query produce `1`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The second query produce `0`.
I run this query in MySQL, and it produce `0`.  https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/wNt1byF7hj6NXEDKDEsp4B/0
