Title: TiFlash causes heavy PD pressure when there are many regions
Description:
## Bug

Currently when there are many regions, TiFlash may cause high PD CPU usage.

After this [PR](https://github.com/tikv/pd/pull/5610) merged, TiDB can get TiFlash replica table region count by PD new API `/pd/api/v1/stats/region\?count` to reduce the overhead of PD when there are many regions.
