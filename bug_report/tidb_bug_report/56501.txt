Title: Regions number of one add-index subtask should be limited
Description:
## Enhancement

If there are many TiDB instances, even if the task of adding indexes is small, TiDB will split at least one subtask for each TiDB instance. The result may bring heavy workload to TiKV and reduce the performance of the entire cluster.

We should set a lower limit for regions of each adding index subtask.
