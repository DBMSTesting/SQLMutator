Title: grouping function arg check logic errors in pre-only-full-group-check phase
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `year` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `country` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `product` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `profit` int(11) DEFAULT NULL
) 
alter table t set tiflash replica 1;
SELECT year+2 as y, sum(profit) as profit, grouping(year+2) FROM sales GROUP BY year+2, year+profit WITH ROLLUP having y > 2002 and profit >0 order by year+2, profit;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
+------+--------+------------------+
| y    | profit | grouping(year+2) |
+------+--------+------------------+
| 2003 |    800 |                0 |
| 2003 |   1010 |                0 |
| 2003 |   1200 |                0 |
| 2003 |   3010 |                0 |
+------+--------+------------------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
MySQL [test]> SELECT year+2 as y, SUM(profit) AS profit, grouping(year+2) FROM sales GROUP BY year+2, year+profit WITH ROLLUP having y > 2002 order by year+2, profit;
ERROR 3602 (HY000): Argument 3 of GROUPING function is not in GROUP BY
```

In plan building phase, grouping(year+2) is seen as not following the only-full-group-logic in pre-only-full-group-check logic.
Actually, we do have our own grouping function validation logic in expression rewriting function, just skip it there, and left it to `expressionRewriter` is enough.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master
