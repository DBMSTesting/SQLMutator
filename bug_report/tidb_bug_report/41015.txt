Title: Call `TaskController.Stop()` can't make producer exit in spmcpool
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
TestAddIndexUniqueFailOnDuplicate with TiDBEnableDistributeReorg(true) 

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Executed successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

We encountered an error and the consumer exits early by calling `TaskController.Stop()`, but the producer doesn't exit, so the test can't return normally.

```

```

It seems we need to notify the producer when `TaskController.Stop()`.
