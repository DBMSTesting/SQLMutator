Title: Unexpected Result by CONCAT_WS
Description:
## Bug Report

`CONCAT_WS(t0.c0, t1.c0)`  is evaluated `NULL` at the second SELECT and the first SELECT shows the result is not empty, so the third SELECT should not return empty result.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (NULL);

SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 LEFT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0>=t1.c0; -- {NULL}
SELECT CONCAT_WS(t0.c0, t1.c0) FROM t0 LEFT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0>=t1.c0; -- {NULL}
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 LEFT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0>=t1.c0 WHERE (CONCAT_WS(t0.c0, t1.c0) IS NULL); -- {}
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The third SELECT should return `NULL`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The third SELECT returns empty result.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
