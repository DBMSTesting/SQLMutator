Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

Change global session variable may need some kinds of privilege, TiDB should check them.


2. What did you expect to see?

I guess TiDB doesn't check it.

3. What did you see instead?



4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
