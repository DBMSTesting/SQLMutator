Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

Lightnining is failing the bulk load for intermittent bulk load requests. One common place where we see it failing is while updating the meta tasks. 
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

It was reproducible internally for intermittent connection issues. 
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I would expect retry with back off as connection errors are intermittent. 
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
It is failing the whole bulk load. 
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
6.5
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
