Title: TiDB and MySQL behave differently when `cast` big number to signed
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
select
(case when false then 0 else 18446744071569971956 end),
cast(18446744071569971956 as signed),
cast((case when false then 0 else 18446744071569971956 end) as signed)
;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
mysql> select
    -> (case when false then 0 else 18446744071569971956 end) as c1,
    -> cast(18446744071569971956 as signed) as c2,
    -> cast((case when false then 0 else 18446744071569971956 end) as signed) as c3
    -> ;
+----------------------+-------------+-------------+
| c1                   | c2          | c3          |
+----------------------+-------------+-------------+
| 18446744071569971956 | -2139579660 | -2139579660 |
+----------------------+-------------+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

    -> cast((case when false then 0 else 18446744071569971956 end) as signed) as c3
    -> ;
+----------------------+-------------+---------------------+
