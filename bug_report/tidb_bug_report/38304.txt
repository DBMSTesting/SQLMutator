Title: Incorrect Result by `LEFT JOIN`
Description:
## Bug Report

Inconsistent results by `LEFT JOIN`.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 BLOB(5), c1 BLOB(5));
CREATE TABLE t1 (c0 BOOL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(false);
INSERT INTO t0(c0, c1) VALUES ('>', true);

SELECT * FROM t0 LEFT OUTER JOIN t1 ON NULL; -- {>|1|NULL}
SELECT NOT '2' =(t1.c0 AND t0.c1 IS NULL) FROM t0 LEFT OUTER JOIN t1 ON NULL; -- {1}
SELECT * FROM t0 LEFT JOIN t1 ON NULL WHERE NOT '2' =(t1.c0 AND t0.c1 IS NULL); -- Empty set
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The first `SELECT` returns non-empty results and the predicate `NOT '2' =(t1.c0 AND t0.c1 IS NULL)` is evaluated `TRUE` in the second `SELECT`, but the third `SELECT` returns nothing. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
