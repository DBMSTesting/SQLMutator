Title: Change useConcurrentReaderCurrent to bool type
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

In `byteReader#switchToConcurrentReaderImpl`, we set `useConcurrentReaderCurrent` to true before re-allocating buffer for concurrent reader. This would produce data race when another thread uses the buffer of concurrent reader before the allocation returns.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
`useConcurrentReaderCurrent` can be changed to `bool`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The `useConcurrentReaderCurrent` is set to true before allocation is completed.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master branch.
