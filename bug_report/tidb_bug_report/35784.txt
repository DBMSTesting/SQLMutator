Title: Privilege check is skipped for PREPARE statement
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

The root creates a user with no privileges:
```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'u1'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> create table test.t1(id int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Login with `u1`:
```sql
mysql -h127.1 -uu1 -P7000
mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| INFORMATION_SCHEMA |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1 where id=1';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1 where x=1';
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'x' in 'where clause'
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```sql
mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1';
ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user 'u1'@'localhost' for table 't1'
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1 where id=1';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> prepare stmt from 'select * from test.t1 where x=1';
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'x' in 'where clause'
```

Although `u1` cannot see the data, he can inspect the table definition through the `PREPARE` statement. E.g. he knows that the table `test.t1` exists, and `test.t1` has column `id` but no `x`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
