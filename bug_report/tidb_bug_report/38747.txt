Title: Date value change caused by the combination of (JOIN,LIKE,BIN,DATE_SUB)
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (c1 double);
insert into t values (0.0001),(-1),(12.991),(2),(1.009);

SELECT (DATE_SUB(BIN(f1), INTERVAL 1 HOUR_MINUTE)) FROM (SELECT 1 FROM t) AS t1 
JOIN (SELECT (REVERSE(c1)) AS f1 FROM t HAVING NOT (f1 LIKE '%0%')) AS t2; -- sql1

SELECT (DATE_SUB(BIN(f1), INTERVAL 1 HOUR_MINUTE)) FROM (SELECT 1 FROM t) AS t1 
JOIN (SELECT (REVERSE(c1)) AS f1 FROM t HAVING 1) AS t2; -- sql2
```

I'm sorry for my long sql statements, but I've tried my best to simplify them.
The problem cannot be reproduced without any of (`JOIN`,`LIKE`,`BIN`,`DATE_SUB`).

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In theory, the result of `sql1` âŠ† the result of `sql2`, because the `HAVING 1` in `sql2` is always true, but the `HAVING NOT (f1 LIKE '%0%')` `in sql1` may be false. Moreover, the normal `JOIN` does not break this relationship.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

However, the date `1100-01-10 23:59:00` changed to `NULL` after changing `HAVING NOT (f1 LIKE '%0%')` to `HAVING 1`, seems like a logical bug.

```sql
mysql> SELECT (DATE_SUB(BIN(f1), INTERVAL 1 HOUR_MINUTE)) FROM (SELECT 1 FROM t) AS t1 
    -> JOIN (SELECT (REVERSE(c1)) AS f1 FROM t HAVING NOT (f1 LIKE '%0%')) AS t2; -- sql1
