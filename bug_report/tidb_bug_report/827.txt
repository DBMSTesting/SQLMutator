Title: Make sure auto_increment ID does not change during retry.
Description:
WithIn a transaction, a client first inserted a record, then use the last insert ID as a value to update another table, like:

```
// assume we have a table t1 with a single column auto_increment primary key.
begin;
insert t1 values (); // Got last insert ID `100`.
// Client receives the last insert ID `100`, and composed the following statement.
update t2 set t2.t1_id = 100;
commit;
```

In our currently retry implementation, the statements will be re-executed, so the second time we execute the  transaction, it's going to be:

```
begin:
insert t1 values (); // Got last insert ID 101;
update t2 set t2.t1_id = 100;
commit;
```

This will break data integrity as we won't be able to get a `t1` record with ID `100`.

To fix this issue, we can rewrite the INSERT statement before we put it into statement history for retry.

like: `insert t1 values()` to `insert t1 values(100)`.

So we can make sure the ID does not change during retry.
