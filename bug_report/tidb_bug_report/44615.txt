the follow query expect result is 0 but got 12, but I found the query result is indeed 12 from current data. Maybe the data is not correct when do dml.
```
SELECT
    c_id,
    c_d_id,
    c1,
    c_ytd_payment,
    sm
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            c.c_id,
            c.c_d_id,
            c.c_balance c1,
            c_ytd_payment,
            (
                SELECT
                    sum(ol_amount)
                FROM
                    orders STRAIGHT_JOIN order_line
                WHERE
                    OL_W_ID = O_W_ID
                    AND OL_D_ID = O_D_ID
                    AND OL_O_ID = O_ID
                    AND OL_DELIVERY_D IS NOT NULL
                    AND O_W_ID = 2
                    AND O_D_ID = c.C_D_ID
                    AND O_C_ID = c.C_ID
            ) sm
        FROM
            customer c
        WHERE
            c.c_w_id = 2
    ) t1
WHERE
    c1 + c_ytd_payment <> sm;
