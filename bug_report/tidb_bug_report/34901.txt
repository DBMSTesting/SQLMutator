Title: Nested cast() clause outputs zero length
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

First open a mysql client with option `--column-type-info`, such as `mysql --comments --column-type-info --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 -u root -p`.

Then by executing a statement with nested `CAST()`, such as `select cast(cast(1 as binary) as binary);`, it can be found that the length field is wrong.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```mysql
mysql> select cast(cast(1 as binary) as binary);
Field   1:  `cast(cast(1 as binary) as binary)`
Catalog:    `def`
Database:   ``
Table:      ``
Org_table:  ``
Type:       VAR_STRING
Collation:  binary (63)
Length:     2
Max_length: 1
Decimals:   31
Flags:      BINARY
