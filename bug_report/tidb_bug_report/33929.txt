Title: Support index regions and updating the existed table rule when changing partition
Description:
## Bug Report
In the previous implementation, if we set a table rule, the modification only can be applied to the existed partition. The newly added partition won't inherit the table attributes. Another problem is when we drop a partition, the range of this partition won't be deleted in the table rule. In these cases, we need to set the rule again.
