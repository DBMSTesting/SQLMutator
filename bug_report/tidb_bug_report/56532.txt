Title: subquery in window function cannot reference column outside, while mysql can
Description:
## Bug Report

When using subquery in window function, the subselect cannot reference columns of outer query.
When using window function in `coalesce`, the subquery outside window function cannot reference columns of outer query too.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
create table t1 (c1 int primary key);
create table t2 (c1 int primary key, c2 text);

select 
  count((select ref_1.c2 from t1 limit 1)) 
from t2 as ref_1
group by ref_1.c1;

select 
  count((select ref_1.c2 from t1 limit 1)) over (partition by ref_1.c1)
from t2 as ref_1;

select 
coalesce(
    count(*) over (partition by ref_1.c1), 
    (select ref_1.c2 from t1)
)
from t2 as ref_1;
```


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
In MySQL:
```
mysql> create table t1 (c1 int primary key);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> create table t2 (c1 int primary key, c2 text);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> select 
    -> count((select ref_1.c2 from t1 limit 1)) 
    -> from t2 as ref_1
    -> group by ref_1.c1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 
    -> count((select ref_1.c2 from t1 limit 1)) over (partition by ref_1.c1)
    -> from t2 as ref_1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 
    -> coalesce(
    ->     count(*) over (partition by ref_1.c1), 
    ->     (select ref_1.c2 from t1)
    -> )
    -> from t2 as ref_1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
In TiDB:
```
tidb> create table t1 (c1 int primary key);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.14 sec)

tidb> create table t2 (c1 int primary key, c2 text);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.17 sec)

tidb> select 
    -> count((select ref_1.c2 from t1 limit 1)) 
    -> from t2 as ref_1
    -> group by ref_1.c1;
Empty set (0.01 sec)

tidb> select 
    -> count((select ref_1.c2 from t1 limit 1)) over (partition by ref_1.c1)
    -> from t2 as ref_1;
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'ref_1.c2' in 'field list'

tidb> select 
    -> coalesce(
    ->     count(*) over (partition by ref_1.c1),
