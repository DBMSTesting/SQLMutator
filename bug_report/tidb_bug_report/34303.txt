Title: Rarely wrong case of only_full_group_by check
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
set @@session.tidb_enable_new_only_full_group_by_check = 'on';
create table t2(c int, d int);
create table t1(a int, b int);
select t4.d from t1 join (t2 as t3 left join t2 as t4 on t4.d=t4.c and t4.c+t3.c=2) on t1.a=10 group by t4.c;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Throw error for ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY

Since the filter `t4.c+t3.c=2` may filter out some rows of t4 causing that one value of `t4.c` refers to the normal value of t4.d and NULL value, breaking the funcdep.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

no error

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
only master
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
