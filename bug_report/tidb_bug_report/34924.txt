Title: For Kubernetes pods that /sys/fs/cgroup is not mounted, TIDB's init function is causing a pain
Description:
I have to admit this is probably not a big issue, but for developers importing TIDB into their projects, this is a real problem.
The problem is imported by init code in util/memory/meminfo.go:

```
func init() {
	if inContainer() {
		MemTotal = MemTotalCGroup
		MemUsed = MemUsedCGroup
	} else {
		MemTotal = MemTotalNormal
		MemUsed = MemUsedNormal
	}
	memLimit = &memInfoCache{
		RWMutex: &sync.RWMutex{},
	}
	memUsage = &memInfoCache{
		RWMutex: &sync.RWMutex{},
	}
	serverMemUsage = &memInfoCache{
		RWMutex: &sync.RWMutex{},
	}
	_, err := MemTotal()
	terror.MustNil(err)
	_, err = MemUsed()
	terror.MustNil(err)
}
```
After compile and run my project, it panics about "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes" does not exist, I am using TIDB due to it's one of the best sql parsers, we should consider allowing importing TIDB without causing any panic.
