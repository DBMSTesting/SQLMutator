<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
create table t1(a int, b int, primary key(a), index idx(b,a));
create table t2(a int, b int, primary key(a), index idx(b,a));
insert into t1 values(1,1);
insert into t2 values(1,1);
select /*+ INL_JOIN(t1) */ * from
t1 FORCE INDEX (idx)
join 
t2 on t1.b=t2.b and t1.a = t2.a;

select /*+ HASH_JOIN(t1) */ * from
t1 FORCE INDEX (idx)
join 
t2 on t1.b=t2.b and t1.a = t2.a;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
