Title: Undersize regions after lightning import is finished
Description:
## Bug Report
If ingestion fails partially lightning again try to split the regions into unfinished ranges https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/617497366ac4f009880196b27fd5f4b7923d118e/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1099

It lead to lot of undersize regions in tikv.  Split_and_scatter is not required once it is finished successfully. PD is not going to merge the regions as scheduler is paused.
