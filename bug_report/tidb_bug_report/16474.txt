Title: Different error message from MySQL when `group by` a window function or agg function with a `as`
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. What did you do?

In a select stmt, `group by` a number, and this number refers to a window function or aggregation function with a `as`.

### 2. What did you expect to see?
In 8.0.19 MySQL Community:
```
MySQL [test]> select row_number() over () as x from t group by 1;
ERROR 1056 (42000): Can't group on 'x'
MySQL [test]> select sum(a) as x from t group by 1;
ERROR 1056 (42000): Can't group on 'x'
```
### 3. What did you see instead?
In TiDB:
```
MySQL [test]> select row_number() over () as x from t group by 1;
ERROR 1056 (42000): Can't group on ''
MySQL [test]> select sum(a) as x from t group by 1;
ERROR 1056 (42000): Can't group on ''
```
### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
