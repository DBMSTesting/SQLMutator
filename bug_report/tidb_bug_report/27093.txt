### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

current master

This should be introduced by enabling push down agg below projection by default in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/22090.
Before https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/22090, this can also be triggered by turning on `tidb_opt_agg_push_down`.
