Title: Unexpected error when `CHECK` a predicate that is always true.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
The following query triggers an error:
```
CREATE TABLE t0(c1 NUMERIC CHECK (true));
```

This is the error message:
```
Column check constraint 't0_chk_1' references other column.
```
A `true` predicate means no value will violate this constraint. This query can triggers this error in MySQL, and MySQL verified this is a bug.
