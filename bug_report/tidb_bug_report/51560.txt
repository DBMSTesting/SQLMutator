Title: In clause with null causes incorrect results
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
create table A(a int primary key, b int);
create table B(b int primary key);
create table C(c int primary key, b int);

insert into A values (2, 1), (3, 2);
insert into B values (1), (2);

-- Returns data as expected
select b.b
from A a
left join (
  B b
  left join C c on b.b = c.b)
on b.b = a.b
where a.a in (2, 3);

-- Returns null
select b.b
from A a
left join (
  B b
  left join C c on b.b = c.b)
on b.b = a.b
where a.a in (2, 3, null);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Both queries should return two rows with values
```
+------+
| b    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
+------+
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The second query, with the addition of `null` in the `in` clause, returns two rows both with value `null`.  
```
+------+
| b    |
+------+
| NULL |
| NULL |
+------+
```

In mysql this works as expected and both queries return the correct data.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
