Title: lightning precheck message "smaller number for tikv-importer.disk-quota(8EiB)" too ambiguous when local disk space check fails
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Use lightning to import data where lightning local disk space is not enough.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Precheck fail message should be clear, and be able to guide use to fix the issue

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
1. "imprtestimate" should be separated as 2 words
2. "You need a smaller number for tikv-importer.disk-quota(8EiB) to finish imports" is confusing, user doesn't know how to fix the issue, smaller number than 8EiB is too ambiguous.
