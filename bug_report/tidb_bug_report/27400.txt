Title: information_schema.deadlocks incorrectly collects retryable deadlocks as if it's non-retryble
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Construct a scenario where retryable (single-statement) deadlocks occurs.
2. Check `information_schema.deadlocks` for the information of the retryable deadlock.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

When the config `pessimistic-txn.deadlock-history-collect-retryable` is not enabled, there shouldn't be information about it; otherwise, there is a deadlock information about it with `retryable` column be `1`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

In both case the deadlock information shows up, and `retryable` column is always `0`.

The reason is that client-go invokes a callback from TiDB to collect the deadlocks, but it's invoked prior to the `IsRetryable` field being set.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master, 5.2, 5.1
