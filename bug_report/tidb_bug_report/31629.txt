## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
drop table if exists t1;

CREATE TABLE t1(partkey int,nokey int
) PARTITION BY HASH(partkey) PARTITIONS 3;

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 1) , (10, 10);

SELECT * FROM t1;
UPDATE t1 AS A NATURAL JOIN t1 B SET A.partkey = 2, B.nokey = 3;
SELECT * FROM t1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
+---------+-------+
| partkey | nokey |
+---------+-------+
|       1 |     1 |
|      10 |    10 |
+---------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> UPDATE t1 AS A NATURAL JOIN t1 B SET A.partkey = 2, B.nokey = 3;
ERROR 1706 (HY000): Primary key/partition key update is not allowed since the table is updated both as 'A' and 'B'
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
+---------+-------+

|      10 |    10 |
+---------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
