Title: Br backup consumes mounts of time and gererates too many small files in million tables scenario

## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
In a scenario with a million databases and tables, `br full backup` constructs backup ranges based on the data and indexes of the tables. For example, with a million `sysbench` tables, it is necessary to construct 2 million ranges. `br` requests TiKV to upload the corresponding SST files to S3 according to the size of the ranges, which generates a large number of small files and the backup of the data is extremely time-consuming.

In actual testing, we created 1 million databases, 2 million tables, each table containing 2 row of data and one index, with approximately 50GB of for 3 replicas. The full backup took about 6 hours to reach a 60% progress, generating a million-level number of SST files. Ultimately, the backup task failed due to the creation of too many small files on Minio, causing Minio to return an error.
