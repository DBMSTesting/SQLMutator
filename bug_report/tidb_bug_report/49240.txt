Title: tableWorker of IndexLookup didn't enable Paging at all
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Discover this bug by checking code
1. When build indexReader of IndexLookup, it checked paging flag when build kvReq. [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/pkg/executor/distsql.go#L706). So when `@@tidb_enable_paging` is true, indexReader of IndexLooup will use paging protocol.
2. But when build tableReader of IndexLookup, it didn't setup paging flag when build kvReq, check [code](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/pkg/executor/distsql.go#L794), so tableReader of IndexLookup will not use paging protocol.
