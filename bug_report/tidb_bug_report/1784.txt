TiDB crashed here because of OOM. Here is the schema information.

mysql> desc t1;

Current database: test

+-------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+
| Field | Type         | Null | Key  | Default | Extra |
+-------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+
| name  | varchar(128) | YES  |      | NULL    |       |
| email | varchar(128) | YES  |      | NULL    |       |

2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Table t2 has the same schema of t1.

After i restart tidb-server:
mysql> select count(_) from t2;
+----------+
| count(_) |
+----------+
|  7340032 |
+----------+
1 row in set (44.94 sec)

The count is slow at the first time

mysql> select count(_) from t2;
+----------+
| count(_) |
+----------+
|  7340032 |
+----------+
1 row in set (2.87 sec)

I am using the branch: origin/busyjay/add-iterate-bound
