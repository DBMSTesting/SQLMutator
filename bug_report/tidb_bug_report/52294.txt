Title: wrong singleflight implementation for stats' syncload

## Bug Report

We use the `setWorking` for sync load's duplicate task detection.

It will return a boolean value directly after it finds duplicates.

And we can see that the `writeToResultChan` also returns directly by writing an ok result to the `resultCh`.

So the duplicated task will directly return without waiting for the executing one to finish.

As a result, if there are two TiDB nodes and we run sysbench's select_random_points with more than 2 threads, we will find out the following slow query:

The sync load doesn't timeout but we still have the SQLs executed without stats.
Such a slow query would disappear if the thread number is equal to or less than 2.
