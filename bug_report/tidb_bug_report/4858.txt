Title: rename table to anothor database causing insert to fail
Description:
 1. What did you do?

There's some history about rename schema name in MySQL as described in this blog:
https://www.percona.com/blog/2013/12/24/renaming-database-schema-mysql/

It seems that TiDB doen't support rename database name in a simple way either.

Because we tend to create all databases in one TiDB cluster,  we must choose schema carefully, but if name clash actually happens, we have to rename the database name.

So I tried to rename database as described in above blog using syntax as: `rename table db1.t1  to  db2.t1`

this is a simple test case to reproduce:
```sql

create database db1;
create database db2;
create table db1.t1 (id int);
rename table db1.t1 to  db2.t1;
insert into db2.t1 values (1);
use db2;
insert into t1 values (1);
```

2. What did you expect to see?

the moved table should work properly


3. What did you see instead?

I can not insert data into the new table any longer (while select is OK)

```sql
TiDB-Server [test]> create database db1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.25 sec)

TiDB-Server [test]> create database db2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.21 sec)

TiDB-Server [test]> create table db1.t1 (id int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.32 sec)

TiDB-Server [test]> rename table db1.t1 to  db2.t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.17 sec)

TiDB-Server [test]> insert into db2.t1 values (1);
ERROR 1146 (42S02): table doesn't exist

TiDB-Server [test]> use db2
Database changed
TiDB-Server [db2]> show tables;
+---------------+
| Tables_in_db2 |
+---------------+
| t1            |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

TiDB-Server [db2]> insert into t1 values (1);
ERROR 1146 (42S02): table doesn't exist
```


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V`)?
