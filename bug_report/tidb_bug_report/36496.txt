Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

`create view with subquery` like `create view as select * from t where t.a > (select max(a) from t)`

`select * from information_schema.columns` will produce cop request

if we have many views, it will make `tikv/tiflash` increase CPU usage
