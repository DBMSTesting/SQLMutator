Title: Row errors are not correctly checked
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Search for `rows.Err() != nil`.

Examples:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/4235034b40f7b20275abeca3c1b599efb8261b87/util/dbutil/variable.go#L115
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/5d895ee79038f1fb6a714a12665b3723af4b223d/dumpling/export/sql.go#L1515

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```go
if err := rows.Err(); err != nil {
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The errors will always be nil, as `err` is not assigned to `rows.Err()`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Latest.
