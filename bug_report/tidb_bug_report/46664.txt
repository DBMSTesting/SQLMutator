currently, we try to GetStoreMinResolvedTS for all stores from PD every 2 seconds

### Background
#### For `txn_scope`
txn_scope will be global in major situation, So we can judge @@txn_scope value which from the config:
when find is global, we can get cluster-level resolved ts to avoid using kv grpc.

If not, we need to enhance min resolved ts usage:

#### For `min resolved ts`
Nowadays we have 2 api interface for obtaining min resolved ts

- /pd/api/v1/min-resolved-ts: obtain cluster's min resolved ts
- /pd/api/v1/min-resolved-ts/{store_id}: obtain each store's min resolved ts

We can use the `approach I` to get cluster's min resolved ts when @@txn_scope is global.
For client-go's updateSafeTS, we call `approach II` for each store, which is not necessary.
We can extend the approach I params to obtain specified store via a list to reduce the cost per call after api: Extend the min-resolved-ts api to support getting the specified store  pd#6880 merged


### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
For example when we have 100 tikvs and 100 tidbs, then the connections for pd/api/v1/min-resolved-ts to PD would be 100*100/2=5000 in 1 seconds.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
reduce ` pd/api/v1/min-resolved-ts` call

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
For example when we have 100 tikvs and 100 tidbs, then the connections for pd/api/v1/min-resolved-ts to PD would be 100*100/2=5000 in 1 seconds.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
