Title: charset, transaction: update is skipped when the value is treated as the same in CI collations
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

When the new collation is enabled:
```
tidb> select * from mysql.tidb;
+-----------------------+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| VARIABLE_NAME         | VARIABLE_VALUE | COMMENT                                            |
+-----------------------+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| bootstrapped          | True           | Bootstrap flag. Do not delete.                     |
| tidb_server_version   | 51             | Bootstrap version. Do not delete.                  |
| system_tz             | Asia/Shanghai  | TiDB Global System Timezone.                       |
| new_collation_enabled | True           | If the new collations are enabled. Do not edit it. |
+-----------------------+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```
And run the following SQLs:
```
tidb> create table t1(a varchar(10) collate utf8mb4_general_ci);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

tidb> insert into t1 values ('a');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

tidb> update t1 set a = 'A';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0

tidb> select * from t1;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
tidb> select * from t1;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| A    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
(Same with MySQL)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
tidb> select * from t1;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
Please notice that the `Changed Rows` of `UPDATE` is 0.
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
It can be reproduced in 4.0 and master branch.

### Root Cause
Before updating the records, TiDB checks if there is anything that is 'really changed':

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/13bd62e183f81582248e68227a89b64421af607f/executor/write.go#L95

When "new collation" is enabled, the compare of datum is affected by the collation, '`a'` and '`A`' is equal in CI collations. So TiDB treats the update as 'nothing changed' and skips it.

We need to make the `CompareDatum` compare by something like binary collation and solve this issue.
