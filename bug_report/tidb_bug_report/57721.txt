Title: non-existing rollback of TRUNCATE PARTITION, causing hang due to errors.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

During state Write Only, TRUNCATE PARTITION should be able to rollback, but currently that is not implemented until #56029 was merged, including a lot of tests. This needs to be fixed in 8.5 as well.

It also blocks insert during some states, see #55819

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Remove the actual code change from #56029 and run `TestTiFlashFailTruncatePartition` or `TestTruncatePartitionListFailuresWithGlobalIndex` to see they will never complete, due to missing rollback of TRUNCATE PARTITION. patch like this: [truncate_partition.patch](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17917825/truncate_partition.patch)


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Tests to terminate, preferably with success

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Test entered infinit loop.

From TestTiFlashFailTruncatePartition:
```
[2024/11/26 10:50:46.591 +01:00] [INFO] [job_worker.go:784] ["run DDL job"] [category=ddl] [jobID=118] [conn=6] [job="ID:118, Type:truncate partition, State:running, SchemaState:write only, SchemaID:2, TableID:110, RowCount:0, ArgLen:0, start time: 2024-11-26 10:34:41.456 +0100 CET, Err:[ddl:-1]enforced error, ErrCount:2643397, SnapshotVersion:0, Version: v2"]
```

From TestTruncatePartitionListFailuresWithGlobalIndex:
```
[2024/11/26 11:00:53.203 +01:00] [INFO] [job_worker.go:784] ["run DDL job"] [category=ddl] [jobID=117] [conn=3] [job="ID:117, Type:truncate partition, State:running, SchemaState:write only, SchemaID:2, TableID:110, RowCount:0, ArgLen:0, start time: 2024-11-26 11:00:10.181 +0100 CET, Err:[ddl:-1]Injected error by truncatePartFail1, ErrCount:32766215, SnapshotVersion:0, Version: v2"]
```
Where you see the ErrCount > 30M errors, without breaking or rolling back, in write only state, where it should be rollbackable
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
