Title: splitTableRanges called for each batch in writePhysicalTableRecord
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Code inspection.

In [ddl.Ctx.writePhysicalTableRecord](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/00791e7968ffad2de33d7af7f6f8a21580e2ab7e/ddl/backfilling.go#L621)
 for each batch of kvRanges it starts over and calls splitTableRanges again (meaning it requests information of all ranges that would match a full table, from startKey of current batch.

This results in waste of resources, it should either do the query once before the loop, or limit the query to max batchsize + 1 ranges (since the last range is needed later to see if there are any remaining range left to do).

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
