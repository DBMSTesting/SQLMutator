Title: Return deleted record in repeatable-read transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

init
```mysql
create table t0 (a int);
insert into t0 values (1);
insert into t0 values (2);
```

Then run:
```mysql
session1 > begin;
session2 > begin;
session2 > delete from t0 where a=1;
session1 > delete from t0 where a=2;
session2 > commit; -- successful
session1 > select * from t0 where a=1; -- return (1)
```

This is not compatible with MySQL(for both 5.7.41 and 8.0.33), the behaviour of MySQL is:

```mysql
session1 > begin;
session2 > begin;
session2 > delete from t0 where a=1;
session1 > delete from t0 where a=2; -- blocked util session2 commit
session2 > commit; -- successful
session1 > select * from t0 where a=1; -- return empty set
```

Though the unblock of `delete from t0 where a=2;` in session1 is mentioned in doc[1]. But the followed commit is success (unlike the differ said in doc), and the follow incompatible select is also unmentioned.
