Title: domain: lock error is not handled getting commit ts of schema diff key
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Running stale read with concurrent DDL statements.
The cause of this issue is that the `mvccGetResp` may contain `Write` information or `Lock` information when there's a perwrite lock on the key. In this situation, it's needed to resolve the lock to get the actual `commit_ts` of the schema version. Currently, [it's not handled](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/pkg/store/helper/helper.go#L138) so even though the internal transaction has been committed the mvcc get may return nothing reading the schema diff key. 

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The stale read should use schema versions from schema cache.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Sometimes the schema cache would be invalidated because of `mvcc get` error when  getting commit ts of schema version.
