Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
According to 
```
	if RunWorker {
		d.sessPool = newSessionPool(ctxPool)
        }
```
struct ddl doesn't have sessPool if RunWorker == false.

There may cause some problems if ddl use sessPool later.
For example
1. the check checkDeleteRangeCnt would use it.
2. alter table Shard RowID would use it.
