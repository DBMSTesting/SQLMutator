Title: `constraint_name` condition is ignored in `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`
Description:
This issue is similar to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55156, and is introduced in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/54333.

I'd like to introduce a better way to test these functions :thinking: . It's really easy to make mistakes by not using one of the extracted conditions.
