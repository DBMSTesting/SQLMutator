Title: Possible wrong global histogram after merging the partition statistics
Description:

![img_v3_029e_2a4ddc4e-edd6-44f4-946c-9936eabe1f2g](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/assets/7846227/04524279-cca7-400d-a661-a86de296de4f)

After the `slices.SortFunc`, The order like `[2, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]` will be a valid sorted result. And the following merging process just checks the bucket size. So it's possible that we treat the `[2, 2]` as the first global bucket and merge `[1, 3]` and `[2, 3]` as the second.

The merge result is wrong.
