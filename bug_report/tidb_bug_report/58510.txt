Title: `timer` will keep waiting for job if it exists in history but not exists in status and the owner stopped.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Create a TTL table.
2. After the entry in both `tidb_ttl_table_status` and `tidb_ttl_job_history` are created, drop the table.
3. Make the owner fault

After a while, the owner will remove the job (as the logic in `(*JobManager).checkNotOwnJob()`), and nobody will update the history anymore.

Then the timer will always find the job because the entry in `tidb_ttl_job_history` still exists, and wait for it to finish.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Don't spawn new goroutine to wait for these not exist tables.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Keeps waiting for the TTL job for non-exist table to finish.
