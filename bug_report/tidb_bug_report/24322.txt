Title: Comment length limits cause minor MySQL incompatibility
Description:
## Bug Report

TiDB v5.0.0 allows comments of more than 1024 characters. This make it harder to migrate back to MySQL or when a product has to support both TiDB and MySQL.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

create table t1 (id int primary key comment '一二三四五六七八九十......');

With a comment of >1024 characters.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

MySQL 8.0.22 responds with:
```
ERROR 1629 (HY000): Comment for field 'id' is too long (max = 1024)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G

### Suggested solution

Check *new* comments for the length in characters but allow pre-existing comments that don't adhere to this limit.
