Title: Unexpected values appeared in select query statements that should logically imply each other
Description:
## Bug Report

In theory,the result of sql2(distinct)  ∈  the result of sql1

however,in sql2  any return couldn't we find after adding >,which seems like a logical bug

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
’‘’create table
```
CREATE TABLE table_3_utf8_undef (
  `col_decimal(40, 20)_key_unsigned` DECIMAL(40, 20) UNSIGNED,
  `col_char(20)_key_signed` CHAR(20),
  PRIMARY KEY (`col_decimal(40, 20)_key_unsigned`),
  KEY (`col_char(20)_key_signed`)
) CHARACTER SET utf8;
INSERT INTO table_3_utf8_undef (`col_decimal(40, 20)_key_unsigned`, `col_char(20)_key_signed`) VALUES
(1, '3	'),
(12.991, '1'),
(47.1515, 'w');
```
'''sql1
```
SELECT 
      (!`f5`) AS `f1`
    FROM 
      (SELECT `col_decimal(40, 20)_key_unsigned` AS `f5`
       FROM `table_3_utf8_undef` 
      ) AS `t1`
    HAVING 
       ((`f1`) = ANY (SELECT `col_char(20)_key_signed` FROM `table_3_utf8_undef` )); 
```
'''sql2
```
SELECT 
      (!`f5`) AS `f1`
    FROM 
      (SELECT `col_decimal(40, 20)_key_unsigned` AS `f5`
       FROM `table_3_utf8_undef` 
      ) AS `t1`
    HAVING 
      ((`f1`) >= ANY (SELECT `col_char(20)_key_signed` FROM `table_3_utf8_undef` ));    
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
'''sql1
```
f1 
----
  0 
  0 
  0 
(3 rows)
```

'''sql2
some value instead of nothing
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

'''sql2
```
(0 rows)
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
8.0.11-TiDB-v8.0.0
