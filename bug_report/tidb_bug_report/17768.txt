Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-INSERT INTO with ON DUPLICATE clause results in an unexpected "key not exist" error
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#55

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT AS ('a') UNIQUE, c1 INT);
INSERT IGNORE INTO t0(c1) VALUES (0);
DELETE FROM t0;
INSERT IGNORE INTO t0(c1) VALUES (0) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c1=t0.c0; -- Error: key not exist
```
I would expect the statements to execute without errors. However, TiDB prints an error `key not exist`:

```

When using MySQL 8.0.19, the `INSERT` executes without an error:

I found this based on the latest master commit 187f225002b67daa47992816f6ef5ddb76b0f68a, and also checked that this reproduces on the 4.0 RC.
