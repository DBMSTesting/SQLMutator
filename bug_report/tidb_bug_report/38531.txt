Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Start log backup tasks
Run workloads
Inject network partition between one TiKV and one TiDB, the TiDB is PITR checkpoint advance owner.
Check PITR checkpoint status


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
During one TiKV and one TiDB network partition, TiDB cluster can still provide services (though downgraded).
PITR checkpoint should move forward normally in this case to meet RPO.
