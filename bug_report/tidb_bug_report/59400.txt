Title: The load privilege event is laggy after the workload gone
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

I create 2M users, and the keep 10% of them active, then run 

"set password for test = 'xxx'" for all the 2M users

then run

"alter user test%d failed_login_attempts 10" for all the 2M users

... 



### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

After the workload gone, I expect tidb server to be idle.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The CPU is 100%, using up one core handling privilege reload event.

As we can see, tidb is still receiving privilege reload event from etcd, for a long time after the workload finish ...
And it's using 1 cpu core to handle the privilege reload loop.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

master?  I modify some code for testing but the changes are unrelated to this issue.
