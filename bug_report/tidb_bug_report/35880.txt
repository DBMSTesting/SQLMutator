Title: lightning failed to connect to tidb when using ipv6 host
Description:
## Bug Report

like https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/6135, we should use [net.JoinHostPort](https://pkg.go.dev/net#JoinHostPort) in:

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/ea5b0ff8df5bbe8b9c9cc9eccf5770803d821925/br/pkg/lightning/common/util.go#L60

**PS: we cannot workaround by add square brace to host since when connecting to tidb status port we uses `net.JoinHostPort`, in which case it'll add square brace twice**
