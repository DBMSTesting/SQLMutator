Title: TiDB behaves differently than MySQL on authentication of users with the same name and different hosts when wild card involved
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Login as 'root' and create 2 users as follows:
create user 'test'@'%' identified by '%'
create user 'test'@'localhost' identified by 'localhost'
Try to login as 'test' from localhost with password '%'.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
MySQL will reject the login with error message like 'ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'test'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Login succeeds, and CURRENT_USER() will be recognized as 'test'@'%'

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v4.0.15
