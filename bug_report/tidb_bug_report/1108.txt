Title: Round result is different depending on whether its argument is exact or approximate
Description:
Round result is different depending on whether its argument is exact or approximate:
For exact-value numbers, it uses “round half away from zero” rule.
For approximate-value numbers, it uses the “round to nearest even” rule.

1.What did you do?
`select cast(25E-1 as signed)`

2.What did you expect to see?
+-----------------------+
| cast(25E-1 as signed) |
+-----------------------+
|                     2       |
+-----------------------+

3.What did you see instead?
Now they all use “round half away from zero” rule.
+-----------------------+
| cast(25E-1 as signed) |
+-----------------------+
|                     3       |
+-----------------------+
