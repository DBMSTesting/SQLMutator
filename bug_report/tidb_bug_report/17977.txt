After #17853 is merged.
I tried these following statements:

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> insert into pkt1 values ('aaa',1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select b from pkt1 where b = 1;
+---+
| b |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> select b from pkt1 use index(primary);
Empty set (0.00 sec)
mysql> select a from pkt1 where a="aaa";
Empty set (0.00 sec)


CREATE TABLE pkt2 (a varchar(255), b int, unique index idx(b), primary key(a,b));
insert into pkt2 values ('aaa',1);
mysql> select * from pkt2 use index(b);
ERROR 1176 (42000): Key 'b' doesn't exist in table 'pkt2'


```
