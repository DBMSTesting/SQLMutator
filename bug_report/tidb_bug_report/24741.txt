err="runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/executor.(*recordSet).Next.func1\n\t/home/rwork/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/executor/adapter.go:124\nruntime.gopanic\n\t/home/rwork/go/go/src/runtime/panic.go:679\nruntime.panicmem\n\t/home/rwork/go/go/src/runtime/panic.go:199\nruntime.sigpanic\n\t/home/rwork/go/go/src/runtime/signal_unix.go:394\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/session.(*TxnState).GetSnapshot\n\t<autogenerated>:1\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/executor.(*PointGetExecutor).Next\n\t/home/rwork/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/executor/point_get.go:151\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/executor.Next\n\t/home/rwork/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/executor/executor.go:253\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/executor.(*recordSet).Next\n\t/home/rwork/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/executor/adapter.go:128\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/server.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v4.0.8 v4.0.12.
v5.0.1 has the same problem, though it dose not panic, the execution logic is incorrect.

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

The error is caused that the in transaction point get execute with prepared statement params, the execution should not use the cached plan, the logic [check](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/session/session.go#L1824) is incomplete, the [check ](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/planner/core/common_plans.go#L1355) should be used.
