## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. 
```
create table test.t(a int, b int);
create table test.t1(a int, b int);
```
2. Do `alter table t add index idx(a)` job, before this job finishes(like on `StateWriteOnly`), we upgrade this TiDB.
3. Before the upgrade finish,  the `alter table t add index idx(a)` job is paused. And at this time we add `alter table t1 add index idx(a)` job.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Do `add index` on table `t` first, then do `add index` on table `t1`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Do `add index` on table `t1` first, then do `add index` on table `t`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
