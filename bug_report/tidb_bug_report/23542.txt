Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
There are some logs and assumptions which are inaccurate or wrong when the async commit protocol is used, they are:
1. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/tikv/commit.go#L146 when the async commit protocol is used, the  first commit batch which is committed successful may not contain the primary lock, the `committed` field set logic for async commit transactions needs fixing.
2. The related log https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/tikv/commit.go#L129 is also needed to update.
