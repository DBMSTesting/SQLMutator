Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
Use **go language** to test the function of account withdrawal.
process:
-- Do the following for the same account:
```
Start transaction
1> select current_bal, v from act_balance where sub_acct_no = 'xxx' limit 1 for update; #v is the balance version
2> Update the balance and version information in the act_balance table
3> Insert flow information into the tables act_withdraw, act_account_hold, act_account_change, each table.
commit
```

Pressure test operation:
50 threads, pressure test 600 seconds
Pressure test results:
97%+ of withdrawal operations failed.

**tidb.logï¼š**There is a lot of information in the log, as follows.

[2020/01/13 10:54:31.236 +08:00] [INFO] [adapter.go:506] ["pessimistic write conflict, retry statement"] [conn=18084] [txn=413894985859727368] [forUpdateTS=413894985899048965] [conflictCommitTS=413894985938370561]
```

2. What did you expect to see?
Step 1: At any one time, only one thread can obtain the balance and version information, and the other threads are waiting.

3. What did you see instead?
 There are many threads that get the same balance and version information.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
```
> select tidb_version();
