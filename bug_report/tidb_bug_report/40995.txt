Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!
When we use the division function to calculate, we find that if there is a negative number type string, the result will be inconsistent with the expectation

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

select 0/-4; --  expect: 0,  actual: 0.0000
select '0'/-4; --  expect: 0,  actual: -0

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

5.7.25-TiDB-v6.1.2

MySQL has verified this as a bug. please see https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=109837. so I consider it is also a bug for tidb.
