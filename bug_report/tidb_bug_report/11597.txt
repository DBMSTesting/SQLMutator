Title: we need to forbid modifying binary column or regenerate data
Description:
# Bug Report

## 1. What did you do?

```sql
create table t(a binary(20))
```

change the data type of column `a`:

```sql
alter table t modify column a binary(10);
```

## 2. What did you expect to see?

When modifying a column from `BINARY[X]` to `BINARY[Y]`, the underlying data should be regenerated. 

* a short workaround is to forbid these kind of alter table DDLs
* better to be fixed by regenerating the data when `x` is not equals to `y`.

## 3. What did you see instead?

The data type of column `a` is modified successfully.

## 4. What version of TiDB are you using?

```
