Title: wrong behaviour about MySQL certificates for tools
Description:
expected

```
if the MySQL server has configurated with CA, server and client can communicate on TLS connection.

there are two groups of certitificates: (server CA), (client key and client certificate)

with both group: server/client can verify/authenticate the other side
with only server CA: the client can verify the server from man-in-the-middle attack, but the server can't verify the client. For example, the user created by CREATE USER ... REQUIRE X509 can't login.
with only client key and client certificate: the client can login to the user created by CREATE USER ... REQUIRE X509. But it can't verify the server (may suffer man-in-the-middle attack).
```
