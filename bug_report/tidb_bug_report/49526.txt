Title: `HandleBinaryLiteral` should ignore `TypeNull`
Description:
## Enhancement

`from_binary(<nil>)` actually does nothing, but TiDB regards the `NULL` as binary string, so it may avoid some expressions to be pushed down to TiFlash. We can manually ignore this case.

(Though I don't know why this constant is not folded.)
