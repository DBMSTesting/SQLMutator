Title: REVOKE ALL fails on current user
Description:
## Bug Report

This was discovered by running mysql-test against TiDB. A user should have permission to revoke privileges from themselves as long as they have `CREATE USER` granted.

This fails in TiDB because `ALL` is expanded into the all privileges mask + Grant priv.

It also fails in the case that the privilege check is met (u4).

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
CREATE USER u1;
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO u1;
CREATE USER u2;
GRANT SELECT ON *.* to u2;
CREATE USER u3;
GRANT SELECT, CREATE USER ON *.* to u3;
CREATE USER u4;
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO u4 WITH GRANT OPTION;

$ mysql -u u1 # should work

SHOW GRANTS;
REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();

$ mysql -u u2 # should fail

SHOW GRANTS;
REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();

$ mysql -u u3 # should work

SHOW GRANTS;
REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();

$ mysql -u u4 # should work

SHOW GRANTS;
REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
mysql [localhost:8022] {u1} ((none)) > REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
..
mysql [localhost:8022] {u2} ((none)) > REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM u2;
ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the CREATE USER privilege(s) for this operation
..
mysql [localhost:8022] {u3} ((none)) > REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
..
mysql [localhost:8022] {u4} ((none)) > REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM CURRENT_USER();
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql> revoke all on *.* from current_user();
ERROR 8121 (HY000): privilege check fail

mysql> revoke all on *.* from current_user();
ERROR 8121 (HY000): privilege check fail

ERROR 8121 (HY000): privilege check fail

mysql> revoke all on *.* from current_user();

```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```sql
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
