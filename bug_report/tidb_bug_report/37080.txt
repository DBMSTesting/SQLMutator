Title: Make the result of `(*Table).GetColRowCount` stable
Description:
## Bug Report

The order of iterating the map in `(t *Table) GetColRowCount()` is not stable.

Sometimes there may be errors in the stats, and the row count among the columns is different. In this scenario, this will make `(t *Table) IsOutdated()` unstable, and then the plan becomes unstable.
