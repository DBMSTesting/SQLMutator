Title: server: fixed `system_time_zone` value in TiDB
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
```
tidb> show variables like 'system_time_zone';
```

2. What did you expect to see?
From MySQL [document](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/time-zone-support.html):

> The system time zone. When the server starts, it attempts to determine the time zone of the host machine automatically and uses it to set the system_time_zone system variable. The value does not change thereafter.

3. What did you see instead?
For now TiDB use fixed `CST` value.


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
This bug exists in almost all TiDB versions.
TiDB v4.0.0 beta
