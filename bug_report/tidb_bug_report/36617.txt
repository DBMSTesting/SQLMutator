Title: Unnecessary "Binary_plan" field in the slow log
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
set global tidb_slow_log_threshold = 1;
create table t(a int, b int, index ia(a), index ib(b));
```
Then see the slow log.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

If the statement doesn't have a plan, we don't need to print the binary plan.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

In the slow log:
```
# Binary_plan: tidb_decode_binary_plan('')
```

An empty binary plan is printed.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

6.2, master
