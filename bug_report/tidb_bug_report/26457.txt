Title: write useless delete mutation when replace on clustered index
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
create table x(id varchar(200) primary key clustered, v int);
insert into x select 1, 1;
```

then replace

```
replace into x select 1, 2
```

and intercept final 2pc mutation

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

one mutation 

```
PUT TableRow{ id:1}
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

two mutations 

```
DEL INDEX-ID-1{id:1}
PUT TableRow{ id:1}
```

this does hurt correctness but addition DEL will make tikv write more tombstone and GC need do more works

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
