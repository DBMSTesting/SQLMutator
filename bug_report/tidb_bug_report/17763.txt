Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-Value in generated column depends on a WHERE clause
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#62

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT AS (c1) UNIQUE, c1 TEXT);
INSERT INTO t0(c1) VALUES (0.5);
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE t0.c1 + 0.5; -- expected: {1}, actual: {0} 
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` fetches an attribute value of 0, rather than 1. When removing the `WHERE` clause, the query works as expected:
```

I found this based on the latest master commit 187f225002b67daa47992816f6ef5ddb76b0f68a, and also checked that this reproduces on the 4.0 RC. On the latest master commit, the addition `+ 0.5` is not necessary to reproduce this.
