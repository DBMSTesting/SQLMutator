Title: txn: add a variable to control whether to lock unchanged unique keys
Description:
## Enhancement
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/42210 and https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/42713 introduced the behavior of locking unchanged unique keys in INSERT IGNORE/REPLACE/UPDATE statements. 
Locking more keys leads to higher TiKV load and a higher possibility of lock contention.
The performance impact may unexpectedly annoy performance-sensitive applications when they upgrade from an older version. We'd better add a switch to control the behavior.
