Title: optimistic transaction does not respect `tidb_constraint_check_in_place` 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
create table t(id int primary key, u int unique);
insert into t values (1, 1), (2, 2);
set @@tidb_constraint_check_in_place=0;
begin optimistic;
update t set u=2 where id=1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

update should not report any error in optimistic transaction because `tidb_constraint_check_in_place` is off

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
> update t set u=2 where id=1;
(1062, "Duplicate entry '2' for key 't.u'")
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
