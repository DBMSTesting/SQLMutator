Title: Unreasonable behavior when use CTE in view
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

    drop table if exists t1;
    drop view if exists vv;
    create table t1(c1 int primary key);
    insert into t1 values(1), (2), (3);
    create view vv as with recursive cte1(c1) as (select c1 from t1 where c1 = 2 union select c1 + 1 c1 from cte1 where c1 < 3) select * from cte1;
    desc vv;
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

MySQL:

    mysql> desc vv;
    +-------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
    +-------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | c1    | int  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
    +-------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    1 row in set (0.11 sec)
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
TiDB: It's unreasonable because c1 is **NULLABLE** and **Primary key**.

    mysql>     desc vv;
    +-------+---------+------+------+---------+-------+
    | Field | Type    | Null | Key  | Default | Extra |
    +-------+---------+------+------+---------+-------+
    | c1    | int(11) | YES  | PRI  | NULL    |       |
    +-------+---------+------+------+---------+-------+
    1 row in set (0.01 sec)
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
