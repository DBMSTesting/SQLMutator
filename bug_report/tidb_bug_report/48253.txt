Title: TABLESAMPLE REGIONS() with unsigned bigint primary key returns unordered result 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Populate data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE a (pk bigint unsigned primary key clustered, v text);
INSERT INTO a WITH RECURSIVE b(pk) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT pk+1 FROM b WHERE pk < 1000) SELECT pk, 'a' FROM b;
INSERT INTO a WITH RECURSIVE b(pk) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT pk+1 FROM b WHERE pk < 1000) SELECT pk + (1<<63), 'b' FROM b;
SPLIT TABLE a BY (500);
```

Perform the tablesample regions() query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM a TABLESAMPLE REGIONS() ORDER BY pk;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
+---------------------+------+
| pk                  | v    |
+---------------------+------+
|                 500 | a    |
| 9223372036854775809 | b    |
+---------------------+------+
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
+---------------------+------+
| pk                  | v    |
+---------------------+------+
| 9223372036854775809 | b    |
|                 500 | a    |
+---------------------+------+
```

<details><summary>The `pk` is ordered like a signed integer.</summary>

`EXPLAIN`ing this shows the `ORDER BY` is eliminated. So the fix should be applied to the `TableSample` object itself.

```
mysql> explain SELECT * FROM a TABLESAMPLE REGIONS() ORDER BY pk;
+---------------+---------+------+---------------+---------------+
| id            | estRows | task | access object | operator info |
+---------------+---------+------+---------------+---------------+
| TableSample_9 | 1.00    | root |               |               |
+---------------+---------+------+---------------+---------------+
```

</details>
