Title: Index entry delete assertion Key Exists fails during REORG PARTITION for non-clustered table.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Apply this diff ([reorg-part-index-assert-issue.diff.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18376634/reorg-part-index-assert-issue.diff.txt)) and run the new test TestRemovePartitioningCovering and see that there are failed assertions.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
No assertions

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
assertions on update and delete, where the old partition is no longer written by StatePublic, resulting in StateDeleteOnly (previous state, which should still be allowed to do DML) will try to delete index entries, that does not exist, so the Assert that they do exists fails.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
