### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

restore a cluster with schema count large enough.  
Trigger the err at (https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/br/pkg/task/stream.go#L1864).
Because it will print all the schemas used here, the log would become too large to read.

*** Sometimes it would stuck the kubenates due to log length limit***
