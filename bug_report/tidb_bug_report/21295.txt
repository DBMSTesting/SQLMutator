Title: client hang during connecting to tidb
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
I'm not sure if the problem can be reproduced with following step
1. deploy a  tidb cluster with topology `1pd 1tidb 5tikv`
2. network partition pd for a while
3. recover partition

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
client can connect to tidb after partition is recovered

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
client hang on during connecting to tidb

I dump goroutine info from tidb `curl http://127.0.0.1:10080/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2 > goroutine.txt`
https://gist.github.com/cosven/ba63293ad4ff3639181b488023d10c03. 
I found that many goroutines blocks on `LoadGlobalVariables` and they all wait for `goroutine 601` to return.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
```
