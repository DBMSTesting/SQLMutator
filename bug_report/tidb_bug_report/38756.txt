Title: value change caused by DISTINCT
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (c1 int);
insert into t values (1), (2), (3);

(SELECT SQRT(1) FROM t); -- sql1

(SELECT DISTINCT SQRT(1) FROM t); -- sql2
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In theory, the result of `sql2`(`DISTINCT`) âŠ† the result of `sql1`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

However, the value `1` changed to `5e-324` after adding `DISTINCT`, seems like a logical bug.

```sql
mysql> (SELECT SQRT(1) FROM t); -- sql1
+---------+
| SQRT(1) |
+---------+
|       1 |
|       1 |
|       1 |
+---------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> (SELECT DISTINCT SQRT(1) FROM t); -- sql2
+---------+
| SQRT(1) |
+---------+
|  5e-324 |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
