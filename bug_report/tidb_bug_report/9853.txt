Title: SHOW PROCESSLIST always reports idle sessions as zero seconds
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

After https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9842 was merged, `SHOW PROCESSLIST` always reports sleeping sessions as idle zero seconds.

If I go back to release-2.1, it looks like there is a behavior difference where `SHOW PROCESSLIST` reports idle sessions correctly, but `SELECT * FROM information_schema.processlist` does not.  Refactoring in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9842 caused both to behave incorrectly.

2. What did you expect to see?

Idle sessions showing how long they were idle.

3. What did you see instead?

Idle sessions showed zero seconds.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
