Title: Idle TiDB keeps OOM because of AnalyzeColumnExec subMergeWorker
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

I have a 1 TiDB + 3 TiKV cluster containing only one table. The workload is insert only, each row is about 64 KiB.

Now the table has about 10 million rows. But after I stopped writing, TiDB keeps OOM. The TiDB node has 32 GB memory. 

I did a heap profiling and found most memory is used by `subMergeWorker`.

The estimated inuse memory increases like stairs:

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

When idling, TiDB memory usage should be stable and low.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The memory usage of TiDB keeps growing and OOM.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
