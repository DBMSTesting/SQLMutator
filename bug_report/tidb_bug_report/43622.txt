Title: plan replayer can't capture the same sql + plan digest multiple times
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
use test;
create table t(a int, b int, c int, index ib(b));
insert into t value(1,1,1);
plan replayer capture "0c1e64c3fa10874b0563e407998dc1c5971c91d81a222521b8059069b3ea5024" "*";
prepare stmt from "select * from t where sleep(1) and a = ?";
set @a=1;
execute stmt using @a;
plan replayer capture remove "0c1e64c3fa10874b0563e407998dc1c5971c91d81a222521b8059069b3ea5024" "*";
```
Now a replayer zip file should have been successfully generated and recorded in `mysql.plan_replayer_status`.
Now wait for 1 hour for it to be GCed (the file is removed).
In a new session:
``` SQL
prepare stmt from "select * from t where sleep(1) and a = ?";
set @a=1;
plan replayer capture "0c1e64c3fa10874b0563e407998dc1c5971c91d81a222521b8059069b3ea5024" "*";
execute stmt using @a;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Again, a replayer zip file should be generated and recorded in `mysql.plan_replayer_status`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

No replayer zip file is generated.

This can be found in the log:
```

```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
