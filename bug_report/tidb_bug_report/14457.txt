Title: Parser does not permit doublequotes in JSON short-hand extract
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

Forked from https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/14456 - a different issue:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS person;
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_info JSON,
    city VARCHAR(64) AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(address_info, '$.city'))) VIRTUAL,
    KEY (city)
);

INSERT INTO person (name, address_info) VALUES ('wwar', JSON_OBJECT('city', 'Portland'));
SELECT * FROM person FORCE INDEX (city) WHERE address_info->>'$.city' = 'Portland';
SELECT * FROM person FORCE INDEX (city) WHERE address_info->>"$.city" = 'Portland';
```

2. What did you expect to see?

All statements should work.

3. What did you see instead?

The last statement is an error in TiDB, but not in MySQL:

```
tidb> SELECT * FROM person FORCE INDEX (city) WHERE address_info->>"$.city" = 'Portland';
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 69 near ""$.city" = 'Portland'" 

mysql8> SELECT * FROM person FORCE INDEX (city) WHERE address_info->>"$.city" = 'Portland';
+----+------+----------------------+----------+
| id | name | address_info         | city     |
+----+------+----------------------+----------+
|  1 | wwar | {"city": "Portland"} | Portland |
+----+------+----------------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
