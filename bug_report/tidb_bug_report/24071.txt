```
SELECT  ( 2, 2 ) NOT IN ( SELECT   SUBQUERY1_t1 . `col_tinyint` AS SUBQUERY1_field1 , SUBQUERY1_t1 . `col_tinyint` AS SUBQUERY1_field2 FROM `F` AS SUBQUERY1_t1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN `BB` AS SUBQUERY1_t2 ON (SUBQUERY1_t2 . `col_varchar_64` = SUBQUERY1_t1 . `col_varchar_key`  )  GROUP BY SUBQUERY1_field1 , SUBQUERY1_field2  ) AS field1 FROM `BB` AS table1 LEFT  JOIN (  SELECT   SUBQUERY2_t1 . * FROM `C` AS SUBQUERY2_t1 LEFT  JOIN `G` AS SUBQUERY2_t2 ON (SUBQUERY2_t2 . `col_char_64_not_null` = SUBQUERY2_t1 . `col_varchar_key`  )  ) AS table2 ON (table2 . `col_decimal_40_key` = table1 . `col_decimal_not_null_key`  ) WHERE  table1 . `col_varchar_64_not_null` <> SOME ( SELECT DISTINCT  SUBQUERY3_t1 . `col_char_64` AS SUBQUERY3_field1 FROM `L` AS SUBQUERY3_t1 INNER JOIN ( `T` AS SUBQUERY3_t2 INNER JOIN `E` AS SUBQUERY3_t3 ON (SUBQUERY3_t3 . `col_bigint_not_null` = SUBQUERY3_t2 . `pk`  )) ON (SUBQUERY3_t3 . `col_char_64` = SUBQUERY3_t2 . `col_varchar_key`  ) WHERE SUBQUERY3_t3 . `col_varchar_64_not_null` <= table1 . `col_varchar_64` AND SUBQUERY3_t1 . `col_decimal_40` >= table1 . `col_int` ) OR table1 . `col_varchar_key` = 'i' OR table1 . `pk` != table1 . `pk`   ;
