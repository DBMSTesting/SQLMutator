Title: Although the CASE WHEN clause returns the same value as the direct concatenation, FIELD yields different results in each case
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
select FIELD((case when true then ('i' || 'o') else '0' end), 'c') as c0;
select FIELD(('i' || 'o'), 'c') as c0;

```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The condition for CASE WHEN is TRUE, so this clause should return the result of ('i' || 'o'). This statement should return the same value as select FIELD(('i' || 'o'), 'c') as c0;, but the actual result is not the same.
They should return the same result

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```sql
 select FIELD((case when true then ('i' || 'o') else '0' end), 'c') as c0; 
+----+
| c0 |
+----+
|  0 |
+----+
1 row in set, 2 warnings (0.00 sec)

 select FIELD(('i' || 'o'), 'c') as c0;
+----+
| c0 |
+----+
|  1 |
+----+

```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```
 select version();
+--------------------+
| version()          |

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
