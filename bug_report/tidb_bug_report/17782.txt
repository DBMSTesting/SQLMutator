Title: P1-[4.0-bug-hunting]-[Role Based Access Control]-SHOW commands do not privilege check
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#41

---

## Bug Report

### 1. What did you do?

I created a user with zero privileges. They are able to see tables that exist, and histograms. Histograms may still leak important data (for example, a histogram of an orders table could be used to project revenue).

```
CREATE USER n1;
^C
mysql -un1
```
I then ran the following:
```
show stats_meta;
drop stats test.t1;
SHOW STATS_BUCKETS;
SHOW STATS_HEALTHY;
SHOW STATS_HISTOGRAMS;
LOAD STATS 'file_name';
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?

All commands should have failed due to permissions error.

### 3. What did you see instead?

All passed (except load stats, since `file_name` does not exist.. but presumably it would pass).

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
