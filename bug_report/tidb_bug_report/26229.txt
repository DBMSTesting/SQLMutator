Title: concurrently truncating the same partition hangs DDL
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Owner TiDB:
```sql
create table test.t (a int primary key) partition by range (a) (
  partition p0 values less than (10),
  partition p1 values less than (maxvalue)
);
```

Non-owner TiDBs run the following SQL concurrently:
```sql
alter table test.t truncate partition p0;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

All the `TRUNCATE` statements can be executed successfully. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

DDL hangs. `ADMIN SHOW DDL`:
```
Err:[table:1735]Unknown partition 'drop?' in table 't', ErrCount:373, SnapshotVersion:0
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master
