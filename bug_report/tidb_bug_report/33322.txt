Title: incremental restore doesn't empty query job.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
It's hard to reproduce it but easy to fix.
because we use `ExecuteInternal` to Execute DDL job queries during incremental restore.
and sometimes this query might be nil. so the [check](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/9f72bcded79688a9f50f07f4cc76889c534bd633/session/session.go#L1601-L1603) will not pass.

To Fix it we can ignore the empty job.Query in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/49f291db70a466c1a05718f8068b5234f70db1da/br/pkg/restore/client.go#L750
