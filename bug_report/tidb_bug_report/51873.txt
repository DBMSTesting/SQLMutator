Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
CREATE TABLE `h1` (
  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `position_date` date NOT NULL,
  `asset_id` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `portfolio_code` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`,`position_date`) /*T![clustered_index] NONCLUSTERED */,
  UNIQUE KEY `uidx_posi_asset_balance_key` (`position_date`,`portfolio_code`,`asset_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin AUTO_INCREMENT=30002
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(`position_date`)
(PARTITION `p202401` VALUES LESS THAN ('2024-02-01'));
create table h2 like h1;
insert into h1 values(1,'2024-01-01',1,1);
insert into h2 values(1,'2024-01-01',1,1);
analyze table h1;
```

Query A:
```
with assetBalance AS 
    (SELECT asset_id,
         portfolio_code
    FROM h1 pab
    WHERE pab.position_date = '2024-01-01' ), 
cashBalance AS 
    (SELECT portfolio_code,
         asset_id
    FROM h2 pcb
    WHERE pcb.position_date = '2024-01-01' ), 
assetIdList AS 
    (SELECT DISTINCT asset_id AS assetId
    FROM assetBalance )
SELECT main.portfolioCode
FROM 
    (SELECT DISTINCT balance.portfolio_code AS portfolioCode
    FROM assetBalance balance
    LEFT JOIN assetIdList
        ON balance.asset_id = assetIdList.assetId ) main;
```

Query B:
```
with cashBalance AS 
    (SELECT portfolio_code,
         asset_id
    FROM h2 pcb
    WHERE pcb.position_date = '2024-01-01' ), 
assetBalance AS 
    (SELECT asset_id,
         portfolio_code
    FROM h1 pab
    WHERE pab.position_date = '2024-01-01' ), 
assetIdList AS 
    (SELECT DISTINCT asset_id AS assetId
    FROM assetBalance )
SELECT main.portfolioCode
FROM 
    (SELECT DISTINCT balance.portfolio_code AS portfolioCode
    FROM assetBalance balance
    LEFT JOIN assetIdList
        ON balance.asset_id = assetIdList.assetId ) main;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The same result for Query A and Query B.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Query A:
Empty set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

Query B:
+---------------+
| portfolioCode |
+---------------+
| 1             |
+---------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

The warning shows `disable dynamic pruning due to h2 has no global stats`, and after collecting global stats of table h2, the result of Query A is the same as Query B.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.5.3
