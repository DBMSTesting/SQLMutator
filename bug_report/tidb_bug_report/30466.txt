```sql
drop table t1;
create table t1(a int, b double(8, 2));
insert into t1 values
(1, 28.50), (1, 121.85), (1, 157.23), (1, 1351.00), (1, -1965.35), (1, 81.75), 
(1, 217.08), (1, 7.94), (4, 96.07), (4, 6404.65), (4, -6500.72), (2, 100.00),

(6, -1695.31), (6, 1003.77), (6, 499.72), (6, 191.82);
select sum(b) s from t1 group by a having s <> 0 order by s;
select sum(b) s from t1 group by a having s <=> 0;
select sum(b) s from t1 group by a having s <=> 0 order by s;

```
