## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?
```sql
mysql> create table t (a float);                            
mysql> create index a on t(a);                              
mysql> insert into t values (1.0), (NULL);                  
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?
With MySQL 8.0.19:
```sql
mysql> select `a` from `t` use index (a) where !`a`;                                                                 
+---+
| a |
+---+
mysql> select `a` from `t` ignore index (a) where !`a`;                                                              
+---+
| a |
+---+
mysql> select `a` from `t` use index (a) where `a`;                                                                  
+-----+
| a   |
+-----+
| 1.0 |
+-----+
mysql> select `a` from `t` ignore index (a) where `a`;                                                               
+-----+
| a   |
+-----+
| 1.0 |
+-----+
```

### 3. What did you see instead?
With TiDB (and mocktikv/TiKV):
```sql
mysql> select `a` from `t` use index (a) where !`a`;                                                                                              
+--------+
| a      |
+--------+
| <null> |
+--------+
mysql> select `a` from `t` ignore index (a) where !`a`;                                                                                           
+---+
| a |
+---+
mysql> select `a` from `t` use index (a) where `a`;                                                                                               
+-----+
| a   |
+-----+
| 1.0 |
+-----+
mysql> select `a` from `t` ignore index (a) where `a`;
