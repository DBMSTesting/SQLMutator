Title: [BUG]ORDER BY in subquery is ignored in TiDB v7.3.0
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

A bug exists in TiDB v7.3 where the ORDER BY clause in a subquery is ignored in the overall query results. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT ep.exam_project_id, ep.create_time 
  FROM exam_project ep
  ORDER BY create_time DESC
) aa
```

In this example, the subquery correctly orders the results by the create_time field in descending order. However, when used in the overall query, the ordering is lost and the results are not sorted by create_time.

The subquery order by is expected to affect the overall result order, but is incorrectly ignored. This results in incorrect query results compared to what is expected.
