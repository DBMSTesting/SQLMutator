### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Note: "1d" means a DML txn deletes the index key "1", it is converted to "1 -> deleted" and only stored by the temp index.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The DDL should be blocked by the pessimistic lock.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The DDL and DML successfully executed.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
