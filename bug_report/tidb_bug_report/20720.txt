Title: The flags of column are cleared after `change column`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (id int auto_increment primary key, c timestamp);
select c from t;
alter table t change column c cc timestamp;
select cc from t;
```

Execute these statements with `mysql --column-type-info`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The flags keep unchanged after `change column`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The flags are cleared after the DDL as following. However, it's ok if we use `rename column`.

This issue will lead to failure of transaction amender.

```
mysql> select c from t;
Field   1:  `c`
