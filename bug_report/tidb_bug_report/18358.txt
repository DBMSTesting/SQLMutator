Title: Consider service safepoint when checking transaction visibility
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Make a table huge enough that its checksum time can exceed 10 mins.
2. Set GC execution period to 10 mins.
3. `BACKUP` this table.
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Backup success since BR sets service safepoint.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Backup failed with `[tikv:9006]GC life time is shorter than transaction duration` when doing checksum.

### 4. Affected version (Required)
v4.0.1
<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->

### 5. Root Cause Analysis
We issue this error here:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/180c02127105bed73712050594da6ead4d70a85f/store/tikv/kv.go#L186-L190
However, the `cachedSafePoint` is gotten by this key:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/180c02127105bed73712050594da6ead4d70a85f/store/tikv/safepoint.go#L33-L36
which (seems) won't consider the service checkpoint.
