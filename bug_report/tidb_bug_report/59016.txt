### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
the task sender routine A uses error group context
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/889bf45281c4d85a3262cae70b268ec7fb48405e/pkg/ddl/backfilling.go#L1039-L1040
but the adjust worker size routine B uses parent ctx
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/889bf45281c4d85a3262cae70b268ec7fb48405e/pkg/ddl/backfilling.go#L1074-L1081
so if A failed with error, cause error group context cancelled, B keeps running, so we might met potential data race in
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/889bf45281c4d85a3262cae70b268ec7fb48405e/pkg/ddl/backfilling_scheduler.go#L342
and
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/889bf45281c4d85a3262cae70b268ec7fb48405e/pkg/ddl/backfilling_scheduler.go#L322

we should use the same context, and run together under the same group. introduced in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/57468
