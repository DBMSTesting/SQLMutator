  UNIQUE KEY `idx_12` (`col_43`),
  KEY `idx_13` (`col_43`),
  UNIQUE KEY `idx_14` (`col_43`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin;
INSERT INTO `tl50cb7440` VALUES(0.000000000000000000000000000000),(0.400000000000000000000000000000);

WITH `cte_8911` (`col_47665`) AS (SELECT MID(`tl50cb7440`.`col_43`, 6, 9) AS `r0` FROM `tl50cb7440` WHERE `tl50cb7440`.`col_43` IN (0,0) AND `tl50cb7440`.`col_43` IN (0) GROUP BY `tl50cb7440`.`col_43` HAVING `tl50cb7440`.`col_43` IN (0,0) OR `tl50cb7440`.`col_43` BETWEEN 0.84 AND 0) (SELECT 1 FROM `cte_8911` WHERE `cte_8911`.`col_47665`!='');
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

``` SQL
