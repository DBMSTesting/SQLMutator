Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
> set @@sql_mode='allow_invalid_dates';
> create table t(a datetime primary key) partition by range columns(a) (
    partition p0 values less than ('2020-02-31 00:00:00'),
    partition p1 values less than (MAXVALUE)
)
> insert into t values('2020-03-01 00:00:00')
> set @@sql_mode='';
> insert into t values('2020-03-01 00:00:00')
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The second insert should report an error because a is an primary key.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The second insert succeeds. And we can see both of them can be found:

```
TiDB root@127.0.0.1:test> select * from t;
+---------------------+
| a                   |
+---------------------+
| 2020-03-01 00:00:00 |
| 2020-03-01 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+
2 rows in set
Time: 0.010s
TiDB root@127.0.0.1:test> select * from t partition(p0);
+---------------------+
| a                   |
+---------------------+
| 2020-03-01 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+

TiDB root@127.0.0.1:test> select * from t partition(p1);
