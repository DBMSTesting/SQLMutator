Title: plan: move projection elimination to physical optimizing phase.
Description:
When we do projection-elimination in logical phase, it will cause some problems during CBO.
e.g. select * from (select id from a) as a join b on a.id = b.id order by a.id;
the "a.id" in order-by's FromID is Projection. When it walk through Projection, it will be replaced by tablescan's id which FromID is TableScan_a. But when we eliminate projection too early, we will miss the replacing phase and cannot recognize this column in tablescan operator. So the should remain the projections before CBO.
