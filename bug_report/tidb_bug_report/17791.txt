## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

```
SET sql_mode=DEFAULT;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (
 id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,
 pad VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
 expr varchar(100) AS (NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5)
);

INSERT INTO t1 (pad) VALUES ('a'), ('b');
SELECT id, pad, expr, NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5 as expr_in_select FROM t1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?

In MySQL 5.7/8.0:

```
mysql> SELECT id, pad, expr, NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5 as expr_in_select FROM t1;
+----+-----+------+----------------+
| id | pad | expr | expr_in_select |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
|  1 | a   | 0    |              0 |
|  2 | b   | 0    |              0 |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead?

In TiDB:

```
mysql> SELECT id, pad, expr, NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5 as expr_in_select FROM t1;
+----+-----+------+----------------+
| id | pad | expr | expr_in_select |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
|  1 | a   | 1    |              0 |
|  2 | b   | 1    |              0 |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The longer answer is that in expressions MySQL has an sql-mode which influences this behavior. In MySQL's gcol expressions the sql-mode is always OFF (same as server default). In TiDB's it is always ON. You can add this to the test case to demonstrate:

```
SET sql_mode = 'HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE';
SELECT id, pad, expr, NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5 as expr_in_select FROM t1;

..

tidb> SELECT id, pad, expr, NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5 as expr_in_select FROM t1;
+----+-----+------+----------------+
| id | pad | expr | expr_in_select |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
|  1 | a   | 1    |              1 |
|  2 | b   | 1    |              1 |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT id, pad, expr, NOT 1 BETWEEN -5 AND 5 as expr_in_select FROM t1;
+----+-----+------+----------------+
| id | pad | expr | expr_in_select |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
|  1 | a   | 0    |              1 |
|  2 | b   | 0    |              1 |
+----+-----+------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

```
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
