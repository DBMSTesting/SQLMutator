Title: bindings with `ignore_plan_cache_hint` cannot work
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
-- enable the plan-cache --
create table t (a int);
create binding for select * from t using select /*+ ignore_plan_cache() */ * from t;
prepare stmt from 'select * from t';
execute stmt;
execute stmt;
select @@last_plan_from_cache;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The second execute-stmt cannot hit the cache since we create a binding with ignore_plan_cache() for it.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
It can hit the cache.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
