Title: MPP coordinator will leak when error happened before respIter is created
Description:

When NewExecutorWithRetry returns error, the mpp coordinator may have been already created inside mppExec and registered in global MPPCoordinatorManager map:

The mpp coordinator resource will not be released even when MPPGather is closed, because mppExec will be closed only when respIter is not nil:
