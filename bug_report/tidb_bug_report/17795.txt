## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

I created a user with no permissions then logged in:

```
CREATE USER u1;
^C
$ mysql -uu1
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?

```
mysql> DROP TABLE mysql.user;
ERROR 1142 (42000): DROP command denied to user 'u1'@'localhost' for table 'user'
```

### 3. What did you see instead?

```
mysql> drop table mysql.user;
ERROR 1142 (42000): DROP command denied to user '127.0.0.1'@'u1' for table 'user'
```

The host and user are switched.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
