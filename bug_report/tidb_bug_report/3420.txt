Title: 2pc: cleanup primary key first
Description:
Hi,
     This PR fix the following bug:
     When commit primary receive a undetermined error,  we can not sure whether the `txn` had been committed successfully. On the master branch,  we would do clean up parallel when meet the undetermined error ,  while the primary would be failed with `txn has been committed` and the secondaries would be cleaned up -- we would lost secondaries data in this case. 

In this PR, we do two changes to fix the bug:
1.  For the `clean up` operation, always clean up primary key first.
2.  When a undetermined error received by the `commit` operation, do not cleanup any thing.
