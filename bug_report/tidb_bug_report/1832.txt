Title: Returns `Data Too Long` error for inserting a value longer than column length.
Description:
Currently, we just truncate the value, and doesn't returns error when inserting a value longer than column defined length.

```
create table t (a varchar(10));
```

This should return `Data Too Long` error.

```
insert t values ('abcdabcdabcd');
```

But we return successfully, and the data is truncated to `abcdabcd` silently.
