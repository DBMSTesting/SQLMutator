Title: table ID is not pushed down when querying memory tables in prepare mode
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Execute these statements on TiDB:

```sql
prepare stmt from 'SELECT * FROM information_schema.TIKV_REGION_STATUS WHERE TABLE_ID = ?';
set @a=74;  # The table ID of any existing table
execute stmt using @a;
```

And capture the packets received by PD at the same time.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The request should be `/pd/api/v1/regions/key`, which means TiDB only queries the regions for a specific table.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The request is `/pd/api/v1/regions`, which means TiDB fetches all the regions from the PD. 
Lightning uses prepare mode to query TiDB. This will cause PD OOM when there are lots of regions.
The same problem may also exist on other memory tables.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
