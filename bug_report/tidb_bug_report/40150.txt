Title: Rename column for partition columns give different error from MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

My main issue with this is that it should be prohibited even before sent to the DDL Queue, since it is not supported in MySQL. Now it will fail internally while processing the DDL queue, due to verification of the intermediate table.
