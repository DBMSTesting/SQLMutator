Title: Plan cache caused unexpected end-user error
Description:
## Bug Report


1. What did you do?
<!--If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.-->
 - Deployed a TiDB cluster (with custom scripts)
 - Opened plan cache in tidb.toml: `[prepared-plan-cache]` `enabled = true`
 - Loaded TPCC 1000 warehouse into it with `go-tpc`
 - Ran TPCC benchmark with `go-tpc`


2. What did you expect to see?
 - No errors


3. What did you see instead?
 - Client (`go-tpc`) printed errors(and continued running):
```
execute run failed, err Error 1105: other error: [components/tidb_query/src/batch/runner.rs:90]: BatchSelectionExecutor: Evaluate error: [components/tidb_query/src/rpn_expr/types/expr_builder.rs:26]: Unsupported type: Unspecified
```
 - Same warnings in tikv's log and tidb's log
 - Errors and warnings gone when plan cache was disabled


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
 - Master, git hash: tidb`1771cf887` tikv`a746e09fe` pd`9b098568`
 - Tested http://download.pingscap.org/tidb-v3.1.0-beta.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz with 100 warehouse, issue not exists
