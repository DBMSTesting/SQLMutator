Title: Schema change not working when an async-commit txn updates an old row
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

**Enable async commit or 1PC**

Session 1 | Session 2
---------|----------
|create table t (c1 int primary key, c2 int)|
|insert into t values (1, 1)|
|begin|
|update t set c2 = 2 where c1 = 1|
||alter table t add index k(c2)
|commit|

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Session 1 commits successfully. After that, the add index DDL of Session 2 finishes.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Add index DDL hangs forever and `commit` returns error: 

```
ERROR 8028 (HY000): Information schema is changed during the execution of the statement(for example, table definition may be updated by other DDL ran in parallel). If you see this error often, try increasing `tidb_max_delta_schema_count`. [try again later]
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Master
