Title: addition between `time` and `interval` is not compatible with Mysql
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```sql
SELECT time('12:34:56') + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
```

2. What did you expect to see?
In Mysql
```
mysql> select time('12:34:56') + interval 1 second;
+--------------------------------------+
| time('12:34:56') + interval 1 second |
+--------------------------------------+
| 12:34:57                             |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```


3. What did you see instead?
In TiDB
```
mysql> select time('12:34:56') + interval 1 second;
+--------------------------------------+
| time('12:34:56') + interval 1 second |
+--------------------------------------+
| 2019-04-30 12:34:57                  |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```



4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
```tidb_version(): Release Version: v3.0.0-beta-463-g36bb1ae89```


In mysql's document:

`time('12:34:56') + interval 1 second` is same as `date_add(time('12:34:56'), interval 1 second)`

And 

> The date argument specifies the starting date or datetime value. expr is an expression specifying the interval value to be added or subtracted from the starting date.
