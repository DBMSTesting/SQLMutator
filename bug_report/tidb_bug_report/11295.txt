### What problem does this PR solve? <!--add issue link with summary if exists-->

part of #11223 fix issue #11179

### What is changed and how it works?

add a `ConvertStrToIntStrict` to control the way we convert string to int.

- if ConvertStrToIntStrict is false, the cast way is `getValidFloatPrefix`, then `floatStrToIntStr`
- otherwise, we cast string to integer prefix in a strict way, only extract `0-9`, (`+` or `-` in first bit).

only set `ConvertStrToIntStrict` to true in `select/explain` context, which is compatible with MySQL

following is the cast behavior in insert of MySQL 5.7
```
mysql> select version();
+------------+
| version()  |
+------------+
| 5.7.24-log |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> use test;

Database changed

mysql> create table t (id int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

mysql> insert into t values ('1e2'), ('10e-1'), ('0.123e3');
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.03 sec)
