Title: Unstable negative zero caused by partition
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (`pk` int primary key, c1 varchar(20), key (c1)) character set utf8 partition by hash(pk) partitions 2;
insert into t values (0,'e'),(1,'-0'),(2,'e');

(SELECT NULL FROM t) UNION (SELECT (-c1) FROM t);
```

This is an unstable bug, execute the above `SELECT` 10 times, sometimes it returns `0`, sometimes it returns `-0`.

By the way, if you remove partition, it always returns `-0`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I want to get a stable result `-0`

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
mysql> (SELECT NULL FROM t) UNION (SELECT (-c1) FROM t);
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
| NULL |
|    0 |
+------+
2 rows in set, 4 warnings (0.01 sec)
