Title: Incorrect result when comparing a number with CONNECTION_ID
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Consider the following statements. 

In theory, query1 and query2 should return the same result. However, query1 return nothing while query2 return a CONNECTION_ID 2097158( CONNECTION_ID is different when you reproduce).

```
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 BIGINT , c1 BLOB(301) , c2 BOOL);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 1, 1);


SELECT f1 FROM (SELECT (CONNECTION_ID()) AS f1 FROM t0) AS t WHERE ((f1)>=(-1.487944961E9));  --query1
Empty set (0.00 sec)

SELECT f1 FROM (SELECT (CONNECTION_ID()) AS f1, (((CONNECTION_ID())>=(-1.487944961E9))) IS TRUE AS flag FROM t0) AS t  WHERE flag=1;  --query2
+---------+
| f1      |
+---------+
| 2097158 |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 2. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v7.6.0, v5.0.1
