Title: HashJoinExec and UnionExec may ignore error.
Description:
When select two channels, and both of them can receive, which channel will be selected is undetermined. 
It's possible that error channel has an error, but result channel is finished and selected, then error is ignored.
We can use one channel instead to avoid this issue.
