Title: The collation of `IN` works not properly for old collation
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Consider the following test case:

```go
func TestOldCollation(t *testing.T) {
	store := testkit.CreateMockStore(t)
	collate.SetNewCollationEnabledForTest(false)
	tk := testkit.NewTestKit(t, store)

	tk.MustExec("use test")
	tk.MustExec("set names utf8mb3")
	tk.MustExec("create table t(a char(10) collate utf8_general_ci)")
	tk.MustExec("insert into t values ('a')")
	tk.MustQuery("select * from t where a in ('b' collate utf8_general_ci, 'A', 3);").Check(testkit.Rows("a"))
}

```

The test is taken from `charset_and_collation.test`. It works well for new collation, but when new collation is disabled, it'll give a wrong result.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The SQL returns 'a'

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The SQL gives nothing

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

`cf5c68e55587c29d13957ea9db26073f2f7aaf53`.

I've confirmed that this issue is not caused by #52812. It exists before #52812 .
