Title: copr.buildCopTasks in v5.1 consumes more resources than v5.0.2
Description:
## Bug Report

While investigating https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/25726, `copr.buildCopTasks` consumes most CPU usage in the ycsb workload-e. And we found `copr.buildCopTasks` in v5.1 consumes more resources than v5.0.2. After reverting the [change](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/25705), there is a reproducible 3% improvement(6.5k->6.7k).
