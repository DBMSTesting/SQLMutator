Title: br: backup may fail for some of tidb-operator deployed clusters
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Run a cluster with tidb-operator. And then do some scale-out or something for making CoreDNS responses `no such host`. 

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
BR should be able to retry this error. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
BR directly fails.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v6.5.3

## Note
Though it seems retrying host name not found errors isn't a good enough idea, in some internal network where DNS name registering is asynchronous and in that case, we may need to wait the service name registration finish. The side-effect is that when we trying to backing up from some host manually and we made a typo, we may need to wait for a long time before BR fails.
