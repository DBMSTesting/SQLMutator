Title: TiDB 5.0.0 GC problem that can cause duplicated fm-sketch records
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

In the TiDB dashboard, there are some slow queries like SELECT value FROM mysql.stats_fm_sketch WHERE table_id = ? AND is_index = ? AND hist_id = ?:

The amount of data in the internal table mysql.stats_fm_sketchis huge; By processing SELECT count(*) FROM mysql.stats_fm_sketch, you can find the number of records in stats_fm_sketch is huge: in ONCALL-2892,stats_fm_sketchhas more than 100 thousands rows.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
When storing the new fm-sketch structure of a table, the original fm-sketch will be deleted, which is equivalent to replacing the original data;

Fix the statistical information GC process so that the unnecessary fm-sketch data (such as the table has been dropped) can be deleted correctly;

Only when the dynamic mode is turned on, fm-sketch storage is performed on the partition table;

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
bug fixed

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

TiDB 5.0.0
