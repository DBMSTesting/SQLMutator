Title: SetDDLErrorCountLimit doesn't work in tests
Description:
## Bug Report

The following code does not work in `countForPanic`.
```
TestCreateTableNoBlock
...
	save := variable.GetDDLErrorCountLimit()
	variable.SetDDLErrorCountLimit(1)
	defer func() {
		variable.SetDDLErrorCountLimit(save)
	}()
...
```

We need use `set @@global.tidb_ddl_error_count_limit = 1` instead of above code. In addition, there are quite a few places in the test where the above code is used, all of which need to be handled.

After the change, the test execution will be faster.
