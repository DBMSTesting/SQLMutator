Title: memory management issue for large transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

tiup bench tpch --sf=1 prepare --db test
then use dumpling to export lineitem table in sql format. So we generates around 6M insert statements

login to tidb:
create database test1;
create table lineitem like test.lineitem;
set autocommit=off;
source lineitem.sql

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
These are just 6M simple insert statements, it should be completed without issue.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Out Of Memory Quota![conn_id=7590317993653961157]

This issue is not about tidb_mem_quota_query. The memory required to run simple insert statements should not accumulate over the number of rows. This same insert script can run on mysql db without any issue.
