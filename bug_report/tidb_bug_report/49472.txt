Title: Query statistics lock is consuming excessive CPU resources during the auto-analysis check
Description:
## Enhancement
If you have a large number of tables, the auto-analyze worker can help you analyze them efficiently by checking if they need to be analyzed. However, during the analysis, we need to obtain the stats lock information. If a table is already locked, then there is no need to analyze it.
If your table is small, it needs to be checked frequently which can lead to excessive CPU resource consumption due to the querying of statistics lock.
