Title: P2-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-UNIQUE constraint on DECIMAL/floating-point columns causes incorrect result for NULL in AND
Description:
## Description
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#48

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 DOUBLE UNIQUE);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (NULL);
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE NOT (t0.c0 AND 1); -- expected: {}, actual: {NULL}
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` fetches a row:

I found this based on the latest master commit b6fcc157442894f048c1cc65cfcc7776e9ed1a72, and can also reproduce it on the 4.0 RC. Interestingly, when removing the `UNIQUE` constraint, the query works as expected on the latest master commit, but still fails on the RC. This bug affects also `FLOAT` and `DECIMAL`, but not `INT`.
