## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

Enable prepare plan cache in configuration and execute queries:
```
mysql> drop table if exists t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> create table t1 (a varchar(40));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

mysql> insert into t1 values ('C1'),('R1');
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> prepare stmt1 from 'select a from t1 where a rlike ?';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> set @a="^C.*";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> execute stmt1 using @a;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| C1   |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> set @a="^R.*";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> execute stmt1 using @a;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| C1   |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

2. What did you expect to see?

The second `execute` should return `R1`.

3. What did you see instead?

It returns `C1`.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
