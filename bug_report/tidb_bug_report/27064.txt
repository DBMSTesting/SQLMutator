Title: Got updateBindinfo error when upgrade from 4.x to 5.x
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. In a cluster v4.0.14, use the following SQL to create bind

    drop table if exists t;
    create table t(a int primary key);
    select * from ( (select * from t) as x), t;
    create global binding for select * from ( (select * from t) as x) inner join t on x.a = t.a using select /*+ hash_join(x, t) */ * from ( (select * from t) as x) inner join t on x.a = t.a;
 
2. upgrade to v5.0.3, we got the following errors:

    [FATAL] [bootstrap.go:1419] ["updateBindInfo error"] [error="line 1 column 72 near \"AS `x`) JOIN `test`.`t` ON `x`.`a` = `t`.`a`\" "] [stack="github.com/pingcap/tidb/session.updateBindInfo\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session/bootstrap.go:1419\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/session.upgradeToVer67\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session/bootstrap.go:1387\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/session.upgrade\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session/bootstrap.go:639\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/session.runInBootstrapSession\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session/session.go:2304\ngithub.com/pingcap/tidb/session.BootstrapSession\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/session/session.go:2175\nmain.createStoreAndDomain\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/tidb-server/main.go:269\nmain.main\n\t/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/optimization-build-tidb-linux-amd/go/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/tidb-server/main.go:183\nruntime.main\n\t/usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:203"]

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

upgrade successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

upgrade failed.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v5.x
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

**suggestion**: 

In v4.x ```select * from ( (select * from t) as x), t;``` is valid. But we got parser error in v5.x. That's why upgrade is failed. But this behavior is compatible with MySQL8.0. So may be we should record the orginal sql instead of the sql parsed by AST Tree.
