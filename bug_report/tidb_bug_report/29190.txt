Title: log message overload in batchRecvLoop connection failure
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

I set tikv-server security.cert-allowed-cn to a value that does not match tidb-server's certificate CN.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

This should result in some managed failure where tidb-server exits or attempts reconnections with some kind of sensible backoff.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

tidb-server floods its log output with messages, writing up to dozens of messages every ms.
