Title: Slow log's Backoff_total item is inconsistent with backoff details
Description:
1. In the slow log file, the Backoff_total item is less than the Cop_backoff_regionMiss_total_time item, which is unexpected:
Cop_backoff_regionMiss_total_times: 907407 Cop_backoff_regionMiss_total_time: 2290.796 Cop_backoff_regionMiss_max_time: 8.01 Cop_backoff_regionMiss_max_addr: 214.170.4.81:20161 Cop_backoff_regionMiss_avg_time: 0.002532962 Cop_backoff_regionMiss_p90_time: 0.002
Backoff_total: 1892.664

From the client-go code, it seems the bo's context lacks "util.ExecDetailsKey" in some situation:

2. Backoff details will only be recorded when the cop response returned without any error, while Backoff_total is always updated and logged:
Returned without record when response has error:

BTW, the tidb log also doesn't print any backoff info when response has any errors:
