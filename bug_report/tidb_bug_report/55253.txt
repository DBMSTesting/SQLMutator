Title: The `PRIMARY` index is not filtered out from the `TABLE_CONSTRAINTS`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Run the test of `gorm` on TiDB. The test `TestMigrateConstraint` will fail.

It's caused by the similar reason of https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55235 and https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55156. However, it's not fixed yet, because I forgot to filter out the `PRIMARY` index in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/55236 :facepalm: . Now, I hope it's fixed clearly.
