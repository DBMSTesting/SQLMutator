some implementations of `columnAPI.Cols()` just return the slice, like before https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/50062 or after https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/53798. The other will filter and clone the slice.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

stable performance for different versions of lightning

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

the duration doubles

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

at least v6.5.10
