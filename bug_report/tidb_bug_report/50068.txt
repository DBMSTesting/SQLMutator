Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
create table t (a int);
insert into t values (1);
insert into t values (1);

mysql> select /*+ set_var(max_execution_time=100) */ a, sleep(1) from t;
ERROR 3024 (HY000): Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded

mysql> select /*+ set_var(max_execution_time=100) */ a, sleep(1) from t union all select a, 1 from t;
+------+----------+
| a    | sleep(1) |
+------+----------+
|    1 |        1 |
|    1 |        1 |
|    1 |        0 |
|    1 |        0 |
+------+----------+
4 rows in set (2.01 sec)
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The second query should return an error.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The second query's execution time exceeds the limitation.

The reason is that UNION ALL's node is not considered when extracting statement hints:
