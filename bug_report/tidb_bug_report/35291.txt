Title: time: insert item lost the fraction when encountering time string with timezone suffix
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `testSetObjectTime`;
CREATE TABLE `testSetObjectTime` (
  `id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `d` time(6) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin;
INSERT INTO testSetObjectTime VALUES (1, '2020-01-01 12:00:00.123456000+05:00');
INSERT INTO testSetObjectTime VALUES (2, '2020-01-01 12:00:00.123456+05:00');
SELECT * FROM testSetObjectTime;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
MySQL has its warnings as `Incorrect time value: '2020-01-01 12:00:00.123456+05:00' for column 'd' at row 1`
So it won't recognize the timezone suffix and convert the `12:00:00.123456` to its default `UTC` timezone as `07:00:00.123456`

But TiDB will convert the `12:00:00.123456` (from source +5:00, yes we recognized it and used it as source time zone) to its default `Asia/Shanghai timezone` (+8:00) as `15:00:00.123456`, but unfortunately, we lost the fraction here.
```
+------+-----------------+
| id   | d               |
+------+-----------------+
|    1 | 15:00:00.123456 |
|    2 | 15:00:00.123456 |
+------+-----------------+
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
+------+-----------------+
| id   | d               |
+------+-----------------+
|    1 | 15:00:00.000000 |
|    2 | 15:00:00.000000 |
+------+-----------------+
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master
