Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
 1. deploy a tidb cluster with 7.1.0
 2. using tiup bench to run the CH 1000 warehouse benchmark

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Each plan had its unique plan digest in a slow log
```
/*q9*/
SELECT
  n_name,
  extract(
    year
    FROM
      o_entry_d
  ) AS l_year,
  sum(ol_amount) AS sum_profit
FROM
  item,
  stock,
  supplier,
  order_line,
  orders,
  nation
WHERE
  ol_i_id = s_i_id
  AND ol_supply_w_id = s_w_id
  AND mod((s_w_id * s_i_id), 10000) = s_suppkey
  AND ol_w_id = o_w_id
  AND ol_d_id = o_d_id
  AND ol_o_id = o_id
  AND ol_i_id = i_id
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  AND i_data LIKE '%BB'
GROUP BY
  n_name,
  extract(
    year
    FROM
      o_entry_d
  )
ORDER BY
  n_name,
  l_year DESC;
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Two plans of the Q9 in the CH benchmark get the same plan digest `4285855f2de90efa986aac83feed5e92f7d891ad702dbb5940cd660143bc6296`
