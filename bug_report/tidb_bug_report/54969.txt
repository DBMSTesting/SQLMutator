Title: query is very slow when keep order is true
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/0abf3ae75a83edc4d7124c607130826536595f25/pkg/store/copr/coprocessor.go#L222-L256

This code is intended to make memory usage more efficient. The basic idea is when keep order is true, there is no need to start too many cop workers to receive data, because we want the data to return by order. 

However, if selection pushdown occurs, it may require reading many rows to get the desired data. In that case, keeping the concurrency level too low can significantly slow down performance.
