Title: Is delayForAsyncCommit needed before verify records by foreign_key and constraints check?
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

I see there is delayForAsyncCommit before verifying records, for example:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/4f00ece106b1f9b13086d3e683939527d91718de/pkg/ddl/partition.go#L2496-L2498

But there is no delay used by foreign_key and constraints check.

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/4f00ece106b1f9b13086d3e683939527d91718de/pkg/ddl/foreign_key.go#L672

Is it a potential bug under async commit?

I don't known how to reproduce it to verify this question.
