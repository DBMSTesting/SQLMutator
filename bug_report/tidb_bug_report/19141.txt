## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (c_int int, primary key (c_int)) partition by hash ( c_int ) partitions 4;
insert into t values (1), (2), (3), (4);
select * from t partition (p0); -- only 4 is in p0
select * from t partition (p0) where c_int = 1;
update t partition (p0) set c_int = -c_int where c_int in (2, 3);
select * from t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Partition selection should prevent all rows in other partitions from being selected in any situation.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql> select * from t partition (p0);
+-------+
| c_int |
+-------+
|     4 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)

mysql> select * from t partition (p0) where c_int = 1;
+-------+
| c_int |
+-------+
|     1 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)

mysql> update t partition (p0) set c_int = -c_int where c_int in (2, 3);
