Title: tracing code for `copr.buildCopTasks` is wrong
Description:
## Bug Report

Introduced in #40825, the tracing logic for these two parts is apparently wrong.

The `StartRegion()` is called after the part that needs tracing finished.

This will make the recorded time less than expected and can't cover what we want to trace.
