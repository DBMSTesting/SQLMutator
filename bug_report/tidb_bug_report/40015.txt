Title: Logical bug: value changed after relaxing ON condition [v5.0.2, v6.4.0]
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
drop table if exists t;
CREATE TABLE t (c1 FLOAT UNSIGNED);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (47),(28.1237);

SELECT (DATE_ADD(BIN(c1), INTERVAL 1 DAY_HOUR)) AS f1 FROM (SELECT 1 FROM t) AS t1 JOIN (SELECT c1 FROM t) AS t2 ON 1; -- sql1
SELECT (DATE_ADD(BIN(c1), INTERVAL 1 DAY_HOUR)) AS f1 FROM (SELECT 1 FROM t) AS t1 JOIN (SELECT c1 FROM t) AS t2 ON (0 AND c1 != 1) IS FALSE; -- sql2
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In theory, the result of sql2 âŠ† the result of sql1.
Because the condition `ON 1` in sql1 is always true, but the condition `ON (0 AND c1 != 1) IS FALSE` in sql2 may not be true.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

However, the value `2010-11-11 01:00:00` changed to `NULL` after changing `ON 1` to `ON (0 AND c1 != 1) IS FALSE`, seems like a logical bug:

```sql
mysql> select version();
+--------------------+
| version()          |
+--------------------+
| 5.7.25-TiDB-v6.4.0 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT (DATE_ADD(BIN(c1), INTERVAL 1 DAY_HOUR)) AS f1 FROM (SELECT 1 FROM t) AS t1 JOIN (SELECT c1 FROM t) AS t2 ON 1; -- sql1

```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

### 5. Hope these can be helpful for your debugging:

We look for the first version of the bug in all docker images (with format x.x.x) of https://hub.docker.com/r/pingcap/tidb/tags 
We found that the bug first occurred in pingcap/tidb:v5.0.2, it cannot be reproduced in pingcap/tidb:v5.0.1:
