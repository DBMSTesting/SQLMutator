Title: Update statement not blocked by primary or unique lock

## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Prepare table.

```sql
create table t (id int primary key, v int, vv int, vvv int, unique key u0(id, v, vv));
insert into t values(1, 1, 1, 1);
```

In **RR** isolation level.

|  txn1   | txn2  | txn3 |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| begin;  | begin; | begin; |
| delete from t where id = 1 and v = 1 and vv = 1; | | |
| | insert into t values(1, 2, 3, 4); -- block | |
| | | update t set id = 10, v = 20, vv = 30, vvv = 40 where id = 1 and v = 2 and vv = 3; -- will not block, 0 rows affected |
| commit; | | |
| | execute success here | commit; |
| | commit; | |

The final result is

```sql
MySQL [test]> select * from t;
+----+------+------+------+
| id | v    | vv   | vvv  |
+----+------+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |    4 |
+----+------+------+------+
1 row in set (0.002 sec)
```

There is a little difference in **RC** isolation level. Since the insert statement is executed successful when txn1 is committed, we can commit txn2 before txn3, but the final result is same as before.

|  txn1   | txn2  | txn3 |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| begin;  | begin; | begin; |
| delete from t where id = 1 and v = 1 and vv = 1; | | |
| | insert into t values(1, 2, 3, 4); -- block | |
| | | update t set id = 10, v = 20, vv = 30, vvv = 40 where id = 1 and v = 2 and vv = 3; -- will not block, 0 rows affected |
| commit; | execute success here | |
| | commit; | |
| | | commit; |

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The update statement should be blocked.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The update statement is not blocked and executed immediately without any affected rows.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

This issue both exists in nightly and release 4.0
