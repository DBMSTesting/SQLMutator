Title: Querying `stats_extended` reports syntax error
Description:
## Bug Report

Selecting `stats_extended` reports syntax error, and I have to add quotes for it: 
```sql
select * from `stats_extended`;
```
Is `stats_extended` implemented as a keyword in `show  stats_extended`? It doesn't make sense because other stats tables are fine, such as `select * from stats_histograms`.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
select * from stats_extended limit 1;

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

It outputs something.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

mysql> select * from stats_extended limit 1\G
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 28 near "stats_extended limit 1"

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
