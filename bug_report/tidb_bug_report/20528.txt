Title: use `advertise_IP:status_port` instead of `status_ip:status_port` when status_ip is not set
Description:
## Bug Report

Found from https://asktug.com/t/topic/62913 (Chinese version).
We should use `advertise_IP:status_port` instead of `status_ip:status_port` when status_ip is not set. Or `0.0.0.0:status_port` will be requested and the connection will be refused. 

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```
1. Keep the status_ip as default (0.0.0.0)
2. Query `show config`
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
All the configs can be fetched successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Warnings are returned. 
`Get http://0.0.0.0:20180/config: dial tcp 0.0.0.0:20180: connect: connection refused`

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
