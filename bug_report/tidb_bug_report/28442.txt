Title: Sysvar `identity` returns wrong value
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Manual code inspection. See: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_identity -- the identity sysvar is an alias for `last_insert_id`

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

There should be a `GetSession()` func for Identity that does the same thing. Instead it is a noop and does nothing:

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/74b329402dac67da23a142e04f013d3355e4b6f3/sessionctx/variable/noop.go#L488

See: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/28072 for where this was implemented for `last_insert_id`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Noop

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master
