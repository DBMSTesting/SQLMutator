## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

There are a couple of issues on this page: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/transactions/transaction-pessimistic/

### 2. What did you expect to see?

See below

### 3. What did you see instead?

It says "In versions before 3.0.8, TiDB implements the optimistic transaction mode by default, in which the transaction commit might fail because of transaction conflict. To make sure that the commit succeeds, you need to modify the application and add an automatic retry mechanism. You can avoid this issue by using the pessimistic transaction mode of TiDB."

It should say "Starting with TiDB 3.0.8 transactions are pessimistic by default."

The "Usage" example that follows shows how to start pessimistic transactions, but it is all written for 3.0. It will be pessimistic already.

Also under "Behaviors", this sentence is a bit weird:
> When you perform the SELECT FOR UPDATE statement, transactions read the last committed data and apply a pessimistic lock on the data being read.

It doesn't read "the last committed data". i.e. if I perform an update and then a SELECT FOR UPDATE I will get my session's uncommitted changes too:

```
mysql> update t1 set t='fff' where id= 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> select * from t1 for update;
+----+---------+
| id | t       |
+----+---------+
|  1 | fff     |
|  2 | fddfdfs |
|  3 | ffff    |
|  4 | ddd     |
|  5 | eeee    |
+----+---------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

What it does is lowers the isolation level to READ-COMMITTED, such that changes made in other sessions will be visible.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
