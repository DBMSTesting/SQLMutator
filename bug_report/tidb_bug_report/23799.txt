Title: Unnecessary pessimistic rollback is sent on ErrKeyExists
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

It is a regression caused by https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/22976. 

#22976 created a `ErrKeyExists` wrapper in `store/tikv`. Then, the type match at https://github.com/sticnarf/tidb/blob/375de3758c/store/tikv/txn.go#L472 was incorrect. Unnecessary pessimistic rollback may be sent if we receive `ErrKeyExists`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
