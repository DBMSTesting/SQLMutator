Description:
## Bug Report

Preview:
````
mysql> select group_concat(c order by (select group_concat(c order by a) from t2  where a=t1.a)) from t1;

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

````sql
drop table if exists t1, t2;
create table t1 (a int, c int); 
insert into t1 values (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4); 
create table t2 (a int, c int); 
insert into t2 values (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4); 
select group_concat(c order by (select group_concat(c order by a) from t2 where a=t1.a)) from t1; 
````

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

It should execute without error and produce result similar to the following:
