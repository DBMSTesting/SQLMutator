Title: Fix privilege problems of accessing `information_schema`
Description:
## Background

There are some privilege problems of accessing the tables in `information_schema`.
Generally, there are 2 kinds of problems:
1. Users without `PROCESS` privilege should be unable to access the cluster data, such as `cluster_config`, but they can.
2. Users without the super privilege should able to access their own data, such as `user_privileges`, but they can access all.

## Risks

Many tools query tables in `information_schema`. Those tools may need special privileges to import / export / backup / restore data.

## Milestones

### Stage 1

Fix some issues and merge them into 5.1.1 before 2021-7-20.
