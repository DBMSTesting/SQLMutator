Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Create a table with many wide columns(json/text/blob type). Then analyze the table.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The analyze job takes only normal amount of memory and can be executed successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
When TiDB fetches samples from TiKV and builds statistics such as Histogram and TopN from samples, it takes much memory. The  analyze job might be killed from global memory control mechanism.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master
