Title: kill statement can't interrupt subquery
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

As I've mentioned in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/10959, the MAX_EXECUTION_TIME hint **can only kill queries in execute phase**, kill statement has the same problem.

This query can be killed
```
select 1,  sleep(5);
```

while this cannot:

```
select 1,  (select sleep(5));
```

2. What did you expect to see?

`kill tidb xxx` should interrupt  this query `select 1,  (select sleep(5));`

3. What did you see instead?

The query is not interrupted

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
