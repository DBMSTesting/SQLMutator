We shouldn't scale the [`totalCount`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/0470fa31f815b36ebcad9c910215e21042e4dc82/statistics/index.go#L308 ) here, we only scale the [`expBackoffCnt`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/0470fa31f815b36ebcad9c910215e21042e4dc82/statistics/index.go#L300) here.

You can reproduce it through
create tablet t(id int, a int, b int, primary key(a, b) nonclustered);
select * from t where id in (..); // Here the number of `in` expression should be as much as possible.

And the `modifyCount != 0`.

You can run the above SQL and check the estimate row count of the dataSource operator which use the index.
