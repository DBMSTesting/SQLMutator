Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

So i'm not sure what causes this since there's no detail. it occurs every couple of seconds, on all of the (3) tidb. I don't observe an external failure from the messages.
there are no additional logs, just this one. And it no context for me to follow.

Does anyone have a pointer?
