As you can see in the upper picture, The inner worker of `IndexJoin_17` spend `2.89010439s` to fetch data, but the child `IndexReader_37(Build)` only spend `1.999111ms`, It must be something wrong.

The reason is the inner worker maybe use multiple `IndexReader_37` executor to fetch data, but finally, TiDB only record the last executor time cost.
