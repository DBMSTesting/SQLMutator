Title: checksum might mismatch with parallel import if some instances runs too fast
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
if some instance finished import right before we do checksum, the already imported data will be calculated twice, and cause checksum mismatch

it's very hard to reproduce this, it requires
- current instance should be very slow
- another instance runs very fast, and the data should be quite small

so just record this and mark as minor
