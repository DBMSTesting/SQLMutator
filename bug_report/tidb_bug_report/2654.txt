Title: Omit host in grant statement cause error
Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
CREATE USER 'test'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'test';
grant select on test.* to 'test';
```

2. What did you expect to see?

no error

3. What did you see instead?

```
mysql>  grant select on test.* to 'test';
ERROR 1105 (HY000): line 0 column 32 near "" (total length 32)
```

-----------------------------------

'test' is not recognised as an 'user'%'host' pattern, this works:

```
grant select on test.* to 'test'@'%';
```
