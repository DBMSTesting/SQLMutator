Title: Auto_analyze collection mechanism optimization
Description:
cluster versionï¼šv5.2.1

At present, auto_analyze will continue to work according to the previous version of auto_analyze, but this will make the tidb_analyze_version parameter time zone meaningful. When the cluster is upgraded from less than v5.1.0, the new rules for collecting statistics will not be effective.
I know that there are some manual ways to solve this situation, but this is very unfriendly and there is a relatively high risk.
