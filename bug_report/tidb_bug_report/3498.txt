Title: *: Fix a DDL bug about wait time
Description:
If the DDL job is done, this job will put to the DDL history queue,  then the owner waits for 2*lease or checks all servers schema version. 
At the same time, the TiDB that puts the DDL job to the DDL queue (the TiDB that receives the DDL statement) may get the DDL job from history queue, and it will think that this statement has been completed.
So it is a bug, this PR fixed the bug.
