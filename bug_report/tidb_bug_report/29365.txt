Title: Typo in GitHub Workflow in Contribution Guide
Description:
## Bug Report

[GitHub Workflow in Contribution Guide](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/contributors/workflow.md)

### 1. Minimal reproduce step 
In Step 2: [Clone fork to local storage](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/contributors/workflow.md#step-2-clone-fork-to-local-storage), the code snippet is shown like below. 


Install soft for checking your changes:

`$ make check-setup`

### 2. What did you expect to see? 
I suggest removing a shell prompt `$` because it is copied as well and leads to cause an error to users.
