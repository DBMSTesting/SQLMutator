## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

See: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/sql/statements/load-data/

There is a note which reads:
"Committing through splitting a transaction is at the expense of breaking the atomicity and isolation of the transaction. When performing this operation, you must ensure that there are no other ongoing operations on the table. When an error occurs, manual intervention is required to check the consistency and integrity of the data. Therefore, it is not recommended to **set this variable in a production environment.**"

### 2. What did you expect to see?

I think it means "use this feature" rather than "set this variable". i.e. there is no reference to a variable, and I'm not sure how to disable the commit every N rows behavior.

Also as a nit, I think you can use this feature to batch load your production system. It is more accurate to say "not recommended to permit other users to concurrently access the table while it is loading".

(An example of not recommending for production would be using something like a logical dump instead of a physical one.)

### 3. What did you see instead?

See above.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

Docs bug.
