### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
after reviewing all other DDLs, I found another issue similar to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/58843 in drop-column
- in old version we have 2 param, and append the other 2 at runtime, the other 2 are used for deleting kv ranges that's useless
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/945d07c5d5c7a1ae212f6013adfb187f2de24b23/pkg/ddl/ddl_api.go#L5378
- but in new version we set 4 param at first when the job is in v1
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/6463db677eb3c16fe6e7e940e79500bc8ae5ae3a/pkg/meta/model/job_args.go#L776
- if the job is submitted by new version node, but it's run by old version tidb(it's possible when there are multiple owner during upgrade, see https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/58843), the appended args will take no effects, this will cause the data range not deleted automatically. **we don't have drop column during upgrade right now, so it's ok, so we mark it as minor**
