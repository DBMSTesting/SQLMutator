### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
set @@global.tidb_enable_check_constraint = 1;
create table t (a int check (a > 50) ENFORCED);
create table tp (a int check (a < 50) ENFORCED) partition by range (a) (partition p1 values less than (100));
insert into t values (75);
insert into tp values (25);
alter table tp exchange partition p1 with table t;
select * from t; -- shows 25, which breaks the CHECK constraint
insert into t values (25); -- fails as it should
select * from tp; -- shows 75, which breaks the CHECK constraint
insert into tp values (75); -- fail as it should
```
