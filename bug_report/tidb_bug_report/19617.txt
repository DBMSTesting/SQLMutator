Title: TiFlash will throw exceptions when there are duplicated column names
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Deploy a cluster with TiFlash node
2. Create a table using
```
create table if not exists test.t(c1 varchar(256), c2 bigint, `_col$_c2` varchar(10));
alter table test.t set tiflash replica 1;
insert into test.t(c1, c2) values('Hello world', 1),('abc', 2),('xyz', 10);
alter table test.t modify column c2 tinyint;
```
3. When TiFlash syncs its schema with TiDB, it will throw an exception that `_col$_c2` already exists.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
TiFlash keeps an assumption that all column names are unique. No matter the column is public or not. When we try to modify a column from int to tinyint, TiDB creates a "hidden" column with a special prefix but doesn't ensure the uniqueness of the column name. So it makes trouble when TiFlash syncs its schema with TiDB.
Can TiDB prevent duplicated names when creating a "hidden" column? For example, do a check for it and prepend one more prefix for that name.
Another way to do this is to remove the assumption "all column names are unique" in TiFlash. But it needs some time to do that, maybe a few weeks. Spending a few weeks for doing that seems too expensive.

What's more, I wonder whether TiDB can run `modify column` and `add column` for the same table in parallel. If TiDB supports it, then `modify column` may add a "hidden" column and block for a while to reorg its old data. At the same time, users may add a column whose name is the same with that "hidden" column. This will make trouble for TiFlash too.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
When TiFlash syncs its schema with TiDB, it will throw an exception that `_col$_c2` already exists.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
