Title: The estRows is wrong if SQL is executed multiple times
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1) create table:
CREATE TABLE `tb` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `f1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `f2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `f3` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `idx_f1` (`f1`) ,
  KEY `idx_f2` (`f2`) 
) partition by hash(id)
(partition `p0`,
partition `p1`,
partition `p2`);
2) insert data:
insert into tb (id,f1,f2,f3) values(1,1,1,1),(2,2,2,2) ......(1000,1000,1000,1000);
insert into tb (id,f1,f2,f3) values(10000,10000,10000,10000),(20000,20000,20000,20000);
3) analyze table:
analyze table tb;
4) Query
Execute the following Query first time:

the estRows of Query 'select * from tb where f2>=1000 and f2<=2000' is right.
Then execute the same Querys again:

the estRows of Query 'select * from tb where f2>=1000 and f2<=2000' deviates greatly from the previous one.
Why is there such a large estimation error?

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
If we execute the same query multiple times, without new DML operation, estRows should be the same

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
pd instance:v8.0.0
tikv instance:v8.0.0
tidb instance:v8.0.0
tiflash instance:v8.0.0
