Title: Error for MAX_EXECUTION_TIME isn't compatible with MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report


### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Get a statement that gets interrupted because it reaches the `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`.

Different statements are used for MySQL and TiDB because of #34344 (and #43027 )

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

MySQL 8.0.32
```
mysql> drop table if exists t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT, b VARCHAR(300));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.15 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 'string');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1) */ *, SLEEP(5) FROM t1;
ERROR 3024 (HY000): Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
tiup playground --without-monitor --tiflash 0 7.0.0
tiup bench tpcc prepare --warehouses 100
```

```
sql> SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1) */ * FROM stock;
ERROR: 1317 (70100): Query execution was interrupted
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```
