## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In MySQL 8.0, it inserts a 0 value:

```
mysql> select a from t1;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
|    0 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

In tidb, the updated value is NULL.

```
TiDB root@127.0.0.1:test> select a from t1;
+--------+
| a      |
+--------+
| <null> |
+--------+
1 row in set
Time: 0.009s
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

master, but I think it affects all versions
