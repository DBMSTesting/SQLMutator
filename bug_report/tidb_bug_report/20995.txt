Title: expression: unexpected result from TIME() when fsp digits > 6

## Bug Report

It seems that TiDB will report an error when fsp digits is greater than 6, but MySQL will round it to the nearest 6-digit fsp number.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
SELECT TIME(0.1234567);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
+-----------------+
| time(0.1234567) |
+-----------------+
| 00:00:00.123457 |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Invalid fsp 7
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
