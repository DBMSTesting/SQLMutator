Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-Incorrect result when using the empty string as a predicate in a RIGHT JOIN
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#7

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 CHAR);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 CHAR UNIQUE);
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('');
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN t1 ON true WHERE t1.c0; -- expected: {}, actual: {NULL}
```
Unexpectedly, the query fetches a row:
```

```

 When removing the `UNIQUE` constraint, the `NULL` value is not fetched. MySQL 8.0.19 computes the result I would expect:

I propose P0 as a bug level, since it matches the following description: `wrong results returned by the query, and inconsistent results returned by the SQL output.`
