Title: The upper limit of `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` doesn't work
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

It seems that we don't set the max value to `maxDDLReorgWorkerCoun`, we can see [code](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/sessionctx/variable/sysvar.go#L679).
And we can update [tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt]( https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/stable/system-variables#tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt ) too.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

tidb> set @@global.tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt=129;

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
