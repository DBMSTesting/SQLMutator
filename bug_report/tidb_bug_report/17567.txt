In my view, some configurations for `SimpleLRUCache` is misleading and some are over-designed.

For `max-memory`, the description in our [document](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/tidb-configuration-file/#max-memory) misleads and may let user to think  `max-memory` is only for managing `SimpleLRUCache` memory usage.

However, in our [config.example.toml](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/7b2d79c38948c7c7f4767c7135f8360557220411/config/config.toml.example#L200), `max-memory` is described as the memory quota for a single tidb-server. And in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16777 , and we also let `max-memory` to control the memory quota as a tidb-server. The difference between the usage and description for `max-memory` may make user confusion.

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/17298 also pointed out this.

Also, as `GlobalLRUMemUsageTracker` introduced in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16777 , I think the `memory-guard-ratio` is no longer needed and `Capacity` is enough for the elimination strategy.


**Describe the feature you'd like:**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->
To remove the misleading and unnecessary configuration, I think we can

1. introduce a new configuration like `server-memory-quota` for the memory quota for a single tidb-server.  https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/17532
2. Fix the annotation in tidb.toml.example and tell the readers that max-memory is only for Plan Cache in tidb.toml.example in all release branches(v2.1, v3.0, v3.1, v4.0)
3. marked `max-memory` after v4.0
