Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

`alter user test failed_login_attempts 10`

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Mabye log like 

```
 ["secure text"="alter user test1417832@% failed_login_attempts ?"]
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

From the log, I see this line

```
[2025/02/11 15:06:53.508 +08:00] [INFO] [session.go:4109] ["CRUCIAL OPERATION"] [conn=239075682] [schemaVersion=55] ["secure text"="alter user test1417832@%"] [user=root@%]
```

ALTER TABLE has a lot options, shall we add more details about this operation in log?
