Title: prepare plan cache is broken across transaction boundary
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
mysql> create table t(a int not null);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> prepare stmt from "select * from t where a > ?";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> set @p = 0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> execute stmt using @p;
Empty set (0.01 sec)

mysql> begin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into t values(1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> execute stmt using @p;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> rollback;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

2. What did you expect to see?

The second `execute` should return `1`.

3. What did you see instead?

It returns nothing, because it reuses the plan without `UnionScan`. Note that, to reproduce this bug, you'd better have enough free memory, otherwise the plan inserted into cache may be removed to reduce memory usage.


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
