Title: FLUSH PRIVILEGES does not privilege check
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do?

```
mysql> create user nobody;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.37 sec)

mysql> ^DBye
$ mysql -unobody -e 'flush privileges';
```

2. What did you expect to see?

This is an error in MySQL:
```
ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the RELOAD privilege(s) for this operation
```

3. What did you see instead?

It worked fine in TiDB. This is not a major issue, but it could lead to excessive memory usage by unprivileged users, or it could possibly be combined with another vulnerability if a user manages to privilege escalate and insert into the mysql.* tables.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
