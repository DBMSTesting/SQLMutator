Title: Cannot import mysqldump due to empty named constraint
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

I have a database installed on tidb 5.4.1:


it is working properly. I have backed it up using mysql dump, but cannot import that to same version of tidb. THe issue is a constraint name of ``.
```
show create table wp_tec_occurrences;
wp_tec_occurrences | CREATE TABLE `wp_tec_occurrences` (
  `occurrence_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `event_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `post_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `start_date` datetime NOT NULL,
  `start_date_utc` datetime NOT NULL,
  `end_date` datetime NOT NULL,
  `end_date_utc` datetime NOT NULL,
  `duration` mediumint(30) DEFAULT '7200',
  `hash` varchar(40) NOT NULL,
  `updated_at` timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`occurrence_id`) /*T![clustered_index] CLUSTERED */,
  UNIQUE KEY `hash` (`hash`),
  CONSTRAINT `` FOREIGN KEY (`event_id`) REFERENCES `wp_tec_events` (`event_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT `ref_event_id` FOREIGN KEY (`event_id`) REFERENCES `wp_tec_events` (`event_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin AUTO_INCREMENT=90001
```

I cannot drop the `` constraint. I created the new named one (ref_event_id), but cannot get rid of the ``.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

To be honest I'm not sure how this got created. Its part of wordpress.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I expect that a database i dump can be imported as a means of backup/restore or moving between servers.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The restore does not work unless I edit the dump file to name the empty constraint

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
```

So. How can i rename/delete this empty - named constraint?
