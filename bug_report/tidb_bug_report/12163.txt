Title: Default current_timestamp function may lead to invalid time format
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
The table schema is 
`create table test (
id int,
updated timestamp not null default current_timestamp
); `
And load data into the table
`load local infile '/tmp/xxx' into table test character set utf8 fields terminated by '\u0001'`
The file only has id column data. It dosen't happen all the time, but sometime.


2. What did you expect to see?
No errors.


3. What did you see instead?
invalid time format: '{2019 9 11 11 17 47 1000000}'


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
v3.0.2
