Title: TiDB produces different results for SELECT statement when using transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

**Setup the environment:**

```
tidb/bin/tidb-server &
mysql -h "127.0.0.1" -u root -P 4000 -D testdb < mysql_bk.sql
```

_mysql_bk.sql:_ [mysql_bk.sql.txt](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/files/7571924/mysql_bk.sql.txt)

**Testcase 1**
```
mysql -h "127.0.0.1" -u root -P 4000 -D testdb
mysql> delete from t_tir89b where t_tir89b.c_3pcik >= t_tir89b.c_sroc_c;
mysql> select * from (select count(*) over (partition by ref_0.c_0b6nxb order by ref_0.c_3pcik) as c0 from t_tir89b as ref_0) as subq_0 where subq_0.c0 <> 1;
```

**Testcase 2**
```
mysql -h "127.0.0.1" -u root -P 4000 -D testdb
mysql> start transaction;
mysql> delete from t_tir89b where t_tir89b.c_3pcik >= t_tir89b.c_sroc_c;
mysql> select * from (select count(*) over (partition by ref_0.c_0b6nxb order by ref_0.c_3pcik) as c0 from t_tir89b as ref_0) as subq_0 where subq_0.c0 <> 1;
mysql> commit;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The outputs of SELECT statements in Testcase 1 and Testcase 2 are same. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

**Output of SELECT statement in Testcase 1**
```
+----+
| c0 |
+----+
|  2 |
|  3 |
+----+
```

**Output of SELECT statement in Testcase 2**
```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

The output of Testcase 1 contains element 2 and 3, while the output of Testcase 2 (using transaction) is empty. So their results are different.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
