Title: Dump with `--sql` has incorrect progress report
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do? If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

Run `dumpling --sql $query`

2. What did you expect to see?

Either progress for the number of rows returned from that query or no progress report at all.

3. What did you see instead?

4. Versions of the cluster

    - Dumpling version (run `dumpling -V`):

        ```
        Release version: v5.0.1
        Git commit hash: 4cb115746bb658b6d1a12c0e49932bfd3a08afac
        ```

    - Source database version (execute `SELECT version();` in a MySQL client):

        ```
        8.0.22
        ```

From the MySQL general log:
```
...
2021-07-23T08:52:58.380764Z	   25 Query	SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'test' AND table_name = 'a' AND column_key = 'PRI' AND data_type IN ('int', 'bigint')
2021-07-23T08:52:58.381248Z	   25 Query	SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'test' AND table_name = 'a' AND column_key = 'UNI' AND data_type IN ('int', 'bigint')
2021-07-23T08:52:58.381627Z	   25 Query	EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM `test`.`a`
...
```

It looks like it finds all tables that would match the default table filter. Passing `--filter '!*.*'` seems to fix this, but I don't think passing table filters and `--sql` should be valid.
```
[2021/07/23 11:01:56.545 +02:00] [INFO] [status.go:38] [progress] [tables="0/0 (NaN%)"] ["finished rows"=0] ["estimate total rows"=0] ["finished size"=0B] ["average speed(MiB/s)"=0]
```

Testing with `--sql 'select sleep(180)` shows the issue.
