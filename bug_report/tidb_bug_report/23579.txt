Title: most of the opentracing span not created due to the root span not passed to the context.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

I tested tidb with opentracing enabled, using opentelemetry-collector to collect traces. everything looks good but only 'server.dispatch' span was captured. I have already read some of the code, it looks like other types of span never created when tidb is running. I found some code in **server/conn.go** , span 'server.dispatch' created, but not pass to the context. I changed some code and the bug fixed.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

tracing details when sql executes, in other APM system like skywalking, jager etc.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

only "server.dispatch" span can be captured

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

release-4.0
master
