Title: Partition pruning get wrong partition for PointGet with single int column PK
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```mysql
create table t (c int, a int not null primary key, b int) partition by range (a) (partition p0 values less than (10), partition pMax values less than (maxvalue));
insert into t values(1, 13, 1);
select * from t WHERE `a` BETWEEN 13 AND 13;
```

This is a regression from #49161.
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The row that was just inserted.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```mysql
tidb> create table t (c int, a int not null primary key, b int) partition by range (a) (partition p0 values less than (10), partition pMax values less than (maxvalue));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

tidb> insert into t values(1, 13, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

tidb> select * from t WHERE `a` BETWEEN 13 AND 13;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

tidb> select * from t;
+------+----+------+
| c    | a  | b    |
+------+----+------+
|    1 | 13 |    1 |
+------+----+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
The row exists, but will not be found due to bad partitioning pruning.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
