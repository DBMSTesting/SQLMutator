Title: br: got rpcClient is idle error during log meta restore
Description:
## Bug Report

A customer found error `rpcClient is idle` during log restore and causes the restore to fail, looks like some issue with the `client-go` lib that when it recycles the connection a request comes in and will fail with such error. 

At BR side we can probably add a retry logic and next try should create a new connection and works just fine
