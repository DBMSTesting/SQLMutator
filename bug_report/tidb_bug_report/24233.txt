Title: tidb_snapshot is not respected in some cases
Description:
## Bug Report

Refer #24230 , while `SnapshotInfoschema` is set when `set @@tidb_snapshot="xxx"`, it is not applied to all code:

```
executor/coprocessor.go: buildDAGExecutor
executor/infoschema_reader.go: setDataForTiKVRegionStatus, setDataForTiDBHotRegions
expression/builtin_info.go: builtinNextValSig.evalInt, builtinLastValSig.evalInt, builtinSetValSig.evalInt
planner/core/expression_rewriter.go: rewriteAstExpr
planner/core/integration_test.go: TestPartitionPruningForEQ
```

The above code will always use the latest infoschema instead of the old one. Similar cases happen for `SchemaVersion`. Later a PR will be sent for `SchemaVersion`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master branch d3885387195bb47cf2c62cc0584c78c0ab43747e, but the bug possibly affects all version.
