Title: Optimizer may not choose the best query plan for TPC-H
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

On DBaas / AWS EC2, deploy a cluster with TiFlash
(2 TiDB, 3 PD, 3 TiKV, 3 TiFlash. TiKV & TiFlash deployed in the same host)

Load TPC-H dataset  (scale factor=10) with `tiup bench`:
```
tiup bench tpch prepare \
    --host ${tidb_host} --port 4000 --db tpch_10 --password ${password} \
    --sf 10 \
    --tiflash \
    --analyze --tidb_build_stats_concurrency 8 --tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency 30
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

If we create TiFlash replica for those tables, all performance of queries for those tables won't decrease.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

TiDB can NOT choose the best plan for some queries.
On DBaas: Q8, Q16 is not the best.
On AWS EC2: Q3, Q5, Q8, Q16 is not the best.

For Q8: use TiKV engine isolation is better.
For Q16: use TiFlash engine isolation is better.
