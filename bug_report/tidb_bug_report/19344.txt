Title: No matches for kind "TidbCluster" in version "pingcap.com/v1alpha1"
Description:
## Bug Report

<!-- Thanks for your bug report! Don't worry if you can't fill out all the sections. -->

### What version of TiKV are you using?
<!-- You can run `tikv-server --version` -->
v4.0.4
### What operating system and CPU are you using?
<!-- If you're using Linux, you can run `cat /proc/cpuinfo` -->
kubernetes
system: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
CPU:  AMD EPYC 7K62 48-Core Processor
Actually a one core 1 GiB virtual server.
### Steps to reproduce
<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. A complete runnable program is good. -->
When following [docs](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/configure-a-tidb-cluster#pdtikvtidb), trying to deploy a demo Tidb Cluster on my VPS with the [.yaml file](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/examples/tiflash/tidb-cluster.yaml)
### What did you expect?
Successfully deploy TiDB cluster demo.
### What did happened?
I stored the content in `tidb_cluster.yaml`, and tried to deploy TiDB on my VPS with Kubectl. 
```bash
kubectl apply -f tidb_cluster.yaml
```
error occured as:
```
error: unable to recognize "tidb-cluster.yaml": no matches for kind "TidbCluster" in version "pingcap.com/v1alpha1"
```
Then I looked up more detailed [link](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/docs/api-references/docs.md), its content clearly show that "TidbCluster" is actually in version "pingcap.com/v1alpha1".
So I tried accessing pingcap.com/v1alpha1 with browser, only returning a 404 page.
Using curl to get content.
```bash
curl pingcap.com/v1alpha1 | cat
```
output:
```

<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>

```
What happend? Is this a network problem?
