### What problem does this PR solve? <!--add issue link with summary if exists-->

Sql aggregation hint didn't work in some cases, they will be fixed after this PR.

### What is changed and how it works?

Before this PR, we only set `preferAggType` when `buildAggregation`, but logical aggregation will also be generated in `buildDistinct`, aggregation push down and expression rewriter.
