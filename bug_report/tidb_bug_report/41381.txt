Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
create table t(id int primary key, b int);
insert into t values (1, 1);
alter table t add unique index idx(b);

insert into t values (2, 1); -- write only
admin cancel ddl jobs X; -- the job must be rolling back because of the duplicated entry
```

It is not easy to reproduce with MySQL client because the state changes are usually fast.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
Cancelled DDL job
```

or

```

ERROR 8235 (HY000): DDL job rollback, error msg: DDL reorg element does not exist
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
