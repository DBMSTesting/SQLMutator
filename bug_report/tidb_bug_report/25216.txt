Title: Dumpling's exporting transaction has CurTxnStartTS = 0
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

I added a log in `(*Server).ShowProcessList` printing `CurTxnStartTS`. Then deploy tiup playground and hotpatch the tidb binary.

Dumpling's action could be imitated as 

```sql
set @@tidb_snapshot='2021-06-07 15:37:00';
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
START TRANSACTION /*!40108 WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT */;
select * from test.t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

printed CurTxnStartTS should be the TSO of tidb_snapshot

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

SnapshotTS is correct:

after about 2 minute, `show processlist;`

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

5.0.1

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
