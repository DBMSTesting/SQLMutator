Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
set GLOBAL tidb_enable_instance_plan_cache=1;

drop table t3;
CREATE TABLE t3 (c datetime, PRIMARY KEY (c));

use test
prepare p4 from "select * from t3 where c in (?, ? , '2033-11-23')";
set @i0 = '2027-12-17', @i1 = '1986-12-03';
execute p4 using @i0, @i1;
```

open another session and run

```sql
use test
prepare p4 from "select * from t3 where c in (?, ?, '2033-11-23')";
set @i0 = 'a', @i1 = 'b';
execute p4 using @i0, @i1;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
Error 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

If you run the second `execute` in the same session, there will be no error. As you can in the warnings, plan cache is skipped for this SQL:

```
Warning | 1105 | skip prepared plan-cache: Batch/PointGet plans may be over-optimized
```


### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
