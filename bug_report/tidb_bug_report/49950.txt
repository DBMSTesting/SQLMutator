Title: distask scheduler takes step success while it's failed actually
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
as we're checking whether task step fails or success using 2 sql, if the task fail in the middle, we will take it as success and switch task to next step. **if it's already the last step, the task will be marked as success incorrectly**

it might cause some real-tikv case fail
