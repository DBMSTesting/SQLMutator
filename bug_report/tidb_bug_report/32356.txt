Title: TiDB does not process `tiflash/sync-status` from TiFlash correctly
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
ref https://github.com/pingcap/tics/issues/4033

This is because `ComputeTiFlashStatus` reads string with a `bufio.NewReader`, which can truncate long string when `ReadLine`.
This bug has no effect on any previous versions.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
