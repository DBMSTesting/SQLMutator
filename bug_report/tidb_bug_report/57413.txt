Title: Lightning: performance issue when importing from cloud storage
Description:
## Enhancement
When importing from cloud storage, high concurrency can lead to bottlenecks in mydump.PooledReader.Seek(0, io.SeekCurrent) due to the application of ioWorkers. Seek(0, io.SeekCurrent) does not cause disk IO operations, applying ioWorkers is unnecessary.
