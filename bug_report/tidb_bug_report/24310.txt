There is currently no support for changing the type of a column involving generating a column. Related to [compatibility-issues-with-mysql](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/design/2020-07-07-change-column-types.md#compatibility-issues-with-mysql).

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```
 create table t2(id int, a int, b int generated always as (abs(a)) virtual);
 alter table t2 modify column a mediumint;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Return an error like `Unsupported modify column: tidb_enable_change_column_type is true, oldCol is a dependent column 'a' for generated column`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.52 sec)`
