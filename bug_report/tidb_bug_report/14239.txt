Title: tidb-server 'shutdown' command behavior differences
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do?

The shutdown command has two behavior differences from MySQL. The first one is that an OK packet is not returned to the client (leading the client ambiguity: did the command succeed?).

The second is that it exits with a non-zero code.

2. What did you expect to see?
```
mysql8> SHUTDOWN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

3. What did you see instead?

```
mysql> shutdown;
ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query
```

```
./bin/tidb-server --path="127.0.0.1:2379" -store tikv && echo "shutdown with exit0" || echo "shutdown with exit non zero"
...

```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
