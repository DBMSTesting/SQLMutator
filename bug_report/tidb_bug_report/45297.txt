Title: store: the peer id mismatch is not handled
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Consider such a case:
1.  region_id = 0
There's a region with initial peers "1, 2, 3", and later region configuration has changed, for example:
```
1, 2, 3                    conf change => 1 2 3(Removed) 4(Added)
1, 2, 3(Removed), 4(Added) conf change => 1 2 5(Added) 4(Removed)
```

2. The region cache is not refreshed in time, so peer information whose `store_id` is 3, `region_id` is 0 and`peer_id` is 3 still exists.
3. `AccessFollower` is used by the replica selector to decide the target peer for example when stale read is used.
4. If the leader is transferred to peer `5` and stale read retry happens.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The region cache is refreshed as expected.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
After `RegionError` is received by the `kv-client`, the bottom retry keeps happening and there's no chance to rerefresh to invalidate the region cache, thus there are quite a lot of retry and keep encountering `peer is mismatch` region errors.

The cause is possibly that:
1. The `peer id mismatch` is [not processed]( https://github.com/tikv/client-go/blob/5fde3098f9183d22507dbd16597ff5a5d7f84390/internal/locate/region_request.go#L1645-L1648), the replica selector would always retry.
2. The [scope fixing PR](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/43553) make the leader only selection take effect.
3. Once the `leaderOnly` flag is set, all the [checks are bypassed](https://github.com/tikv/client-go/blob/5fde3098f9183d22507dbd16597ff5a5d7f84390/internal/locate/region_request.go#L554-L576) so the `const maxReplicaAttempt = 10` dose not work either.


To fix this issue, it's needed to:
1. Process the `peer id mismatch` error properly and ensure the region cache is invalidated.
2. When `leaderOnly` flag is set, ensure the necessary limit takes effect for example the `const maxReplicaAttempt = 10`. Acually this part code is complex and need careful handling.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
