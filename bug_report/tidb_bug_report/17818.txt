Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-RIGHT JOIN with ELT() predicate returns an incorrect result
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#4

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (NULL);
SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t0 ON true WHERE (ELT(1^t0.c0, 0, NULL, 0)) IS NULL; -- expected: {NULL, NULL}, actual: {}
```
I would expect the query to fetch a row; however, none is returned:
```

```
When using MySQL 8.0.19, the result is as expected:

I propose P0 as a bug level, since it matches the following description: `wrong results returned by the query, and inconsistent results returned by the SQL output`.
