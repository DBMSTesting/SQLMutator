Title: some optimizations may cause some wrong result for extension functions.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

We found serval problems when a extension function is optimized by planner:

- extension function fold by mistake even if it has some side effect.
- extension function result may be cached in some expression such as `regexp`
- extension function maybe cached in plan cache that will cause privilege check pass even if some privileges are revoked.

You can see the test: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/51926/files#diff-b06ca4f8065e5716bc7b3e5d5cfe389156ad9125bddb40ff1d95a59d889d45c8R461 for detail
