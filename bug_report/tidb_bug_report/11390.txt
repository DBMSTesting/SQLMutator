Title: wrong results of `IndexLookupJoin` in some cases
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
When building ranges for `IndexLookupJoin` on an expression like `Column=Constant`, it doesn't take their types into account ([at this line of code](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/planner/core/exhaust_physical_plans.go#L949)).
```
create table t (k1 int unsigned, k2 int unsigned, key(k1, k2));
insert into t values (1, 1);
select /*+ TIDB_INLJ(t1, t2) */ * from t t1, t t2 where t1.k2 > 0 and t1.k2 = t2.k2 and t2.k1=1;
select /*+ TIDB_HJ(t1, t2) */ * from t t1, t t2 where t1.k2 > 0 and t1.k2 = t2.k2 and t2.k1=1;
```

2. What did you expect to see?
These two queries should return the same result;

3. What did you see instead?
The query with `TIDB_INLJ` hint returns nothing.
```
mysql> select /*+ TIDB_INLJ(t1, t2) */ * from t t1, t t2 where t1.k2 > 0 and t1.k2 = t2.k2 and t2.k1=1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select /*+ TIDB_HJ(t1, t2) */ * from t t1, t t2 where t1.k2 > 0 and t1.k2 = t2.k2 and t2.k1=1;
+------+------+------+------+
| k1   | k2   | k1   | k2   |
+------+------+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |
+------+------+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
```
mysql> select version();
+---------------------------------------+
| version()                             |
+---------------------------------------+
| 5.7.25-TiDB-list-313-gca70d74a2-dirty |
+---------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```
