```
drop table if exists t1, t2;
create table t1 (a int);
create table t2 (a int, b int);
select t1.a from t1 join t2 on t2.a=t1.a group by t2.a having min(t2.b) > 0;
select t2.a, count(t2.b) from t1 join t2 using (a) where t1.a = 1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
mysql> select t1.a from t1 join t2 on t2.a=t1.a group by t2.a having min(t2.b) > 0;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select t2.a, count(t2.b) from t1 join t2 using (a) where t1.a = 1;
+------+-------------+
| a    | count(t2.b) |
+------+-------------+
| NULL |           0 |
+------+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
tidb> select t1.a from t1 join t2 on t2.a=t1.a group by t2.a having min(t2.b) > 0;
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'test.t1.a' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
tidb> select t2.a, count(t2.b) from t1 join t2 using (a) where t1.a = 1;
ERROR 8123 (HY000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'a'; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
```
tidb> select tidb_version()\G
