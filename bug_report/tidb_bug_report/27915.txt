Title: ADMIN CHECK TABLE does not check TiFlash consistency
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

This could be considered an enhancement or a bug, but due to the lack of docs, I consider it a bug.

The statment `ADMIN CHECK TABLE` does not check TiFlash replicas for consistency. Thus; there might be table corruption, but the user will receive a false-negative "no errors" after running a check table.

As an interim alternative, `ADMIN CHECK TABLE` could return a warning saying the TiFlash index was not checked. We could also document it as not currently supported here: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/sql-statement-admin-check-table-index/

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Show consistency errors

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Consistency was not checked.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master
