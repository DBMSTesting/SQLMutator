Title: `pre_split_regions` doesn't work with partition table
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
CREATE TABLE partition_table (
    task_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    creation_dt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    result_data JSON
)
shard_row_id_bits = 4 
pre_split_regions = 3
PARTITION BY RANGE (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(creation_dt) ) (
    PARTITION `20200101` VALUES LESS THAN (UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2020-01-01 00:00:00')),
    PARTITION `20200102` VALUES LESS THAN (UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2020-01-02 00:00:00')),
    PARTITION `20200103` VALUES LESS THAN (UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2020-01-03 00:00:00'))
);
SHOW TABLE partition_table REGIONS;

2. What did you expect to see?
I expect to see `number_of_partitions` * `2 ^ pre_split_regions` regions are created with the table creation. So in my test case, I expect to see 3 * 8 = 24 regions are created.

3. What did you see instead?
Only 3 regions are created, one for each partition.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
