Title: implicit cast from unsigned to signed is not compatible with MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
drop table if exists tbl_10;
create table tbl_10 ( col_55 tinyint unsigned, col_127 tinyint);
insert into tbl_10 values (160, 72);
update tbl_10 set tbl_10.col_127 = tbl_10.col_55;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

MySQL 8.0:
```sql
mysql> update tbl_10 set tbl_10.col_127 = tbl_10.col_55;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

```sql
mysql> select * from tbl_10;
+--------+---------+
| col_55 | col_127 |
+--------+---------+
|    160 |     -96 |
+--------+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

`160` is cast to a negative number implicitly. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

TiDB:
```sql
mysql> update tbl_10 set tbl_10.col_127 = tbl_10.col_55;
ERROR 1264 (22003): Out of range value for column 'col_127' at row 1
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
```
