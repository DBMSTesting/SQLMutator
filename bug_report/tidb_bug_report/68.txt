Title: time_test failure
Description:
Hi,
when running the tests I get a failure:

```
FAIL: time_test.go:292: testTimeSuite.TestCodec

time_test.go:305:
    c.Assert(t.String(), Not(Equals), t1.String())
... obtained string = "2010-10-10 10:11:11"
... expected string = "2010-10-10 10:11:11
```

I think the problem is that the tested timezone is equal to my local timezone while it is assumed to be different.
