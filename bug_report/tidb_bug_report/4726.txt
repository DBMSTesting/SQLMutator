Title: plan: wrong calculated row count for `Selection` plan
Description:
Sometimes when `Selection` is the parent of `IndexLookUp`, the row count of `Selection` is larger than `IndexLookUp`, this will cause the bad plan to be chosen.

We have a test case that reproduces this issue.
See https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/plan/explain_test.go#L209
