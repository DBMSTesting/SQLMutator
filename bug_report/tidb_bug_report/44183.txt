Title: MPP dag request's encode type ignored "tidb_enable_chunk_rpc" system variable
Description:
## Bug Report
When review code, found this issue:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b56c5b6e110c67fcd0facaea3b3e97d4d36d5861/executor/mpp_gather.go#L88
We'll use chunk encoding now even tidb_enable_chunk_rpc is false.  
Manually test shows that this won't affect query behaviors, and thus not noticable to users.
