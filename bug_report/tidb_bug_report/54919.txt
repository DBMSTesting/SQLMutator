Title: OOM in Codec.decodeColumn
Description:
## Bug Report

We're getting intermittent OOM's in our TiDB daemon.

Looking at the heap dump from oom_records, we see large retained buffers from decodeColumn that don't appear to be accounted for in running_sql:

We're happy to debug further, but it's unclear what the best way is to understand where these large buffers are coming from or how to limit them. Help?

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

8.1.0
