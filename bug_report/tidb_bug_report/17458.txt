Title: tidb_wait_split_region_timeout don't work in pre-split region when create table
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

Such as below SQL:

```sql
set @@global.tidb_scatter_region=1;
set @@tidb_wait_split_region_timeout=10;
create table t (a int, b int) partition by hash(a) partitions 100;
```

Set the `tidb_wait_split_region_timeout` value to `10` seconds, when `create table`, if pre-split and scatter region spend more than 10 seconds, the `tidb_wait_split_region_timeout` value does't take effect here.
