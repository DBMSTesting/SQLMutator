Title: Learner peers cannot be scheduled using placement settings
Description:
When we are creating a table with learner placement settings like:

```
CREATE TABLE t(a int) LEARNERS=2;
```

The schedule will hang when scheduling learner peers. It is caused by tikv bug: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11463 .

Temporary one way to walk around is to make a two phase operation:

1. Add rules to PD without learner rules and waiting the schedule done.
2. Add learner rules then.
