## Bug Report

```
create table t(c1 int, ld decimal(32,4), rd decimal(32,4));
insert into t values(1, -100.0000, 100.0000);
select sum(ld + rd) + 1 from t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
mysql> select sum(ld + rd) + 1 from t;
+------------------+

+------------------+

1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```

MySQL 8.0.20
