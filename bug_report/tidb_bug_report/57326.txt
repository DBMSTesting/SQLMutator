Title: any(nil) is not equal to nil, should cast it as its original type
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!
```
func (col *Column) Equals(other any) bool {
	if other == nil {. // false
		return false
	}
        col2, ok := other.(*Column)
        // ok will be true
        // then col2 == nil is true 
```
when we pass `var s *Column = nil` into as other with type any here, we found it doesn't equal to nil anymore, unless we downcast it with `*Column` type before equaling with nil
