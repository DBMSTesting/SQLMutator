Title: Cast function should not fail.
Description:
`select cast("-1" as UNSIGNED)` should return `18446744073709551615`, but we get "constant -1 overflows bigint" error.

This is because we use `Convert` function for cast, but actually `cast` works differently than `convert`.
`cast("xxx" as DATETIME)` should returns NULL, but `Convert` such an invalid time string returns zero time.
