Title: Lightning: Table Empty Check Cannot Find Imported Dirty Data on Previous Failed Imports
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Import the data using Lightning, and halt it half-way during importing the data records, but before importing any indices .  
2. Import the data a second time.  

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The second import should not be allowed (if check-requirements is turned on ), because the table has actually imported some record data in the previous import.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
* The second import can be executed successfully
* If checking the record count, we can find inconsistencies on these two statements: 
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t USE INDEX();
```
Seems the dirty data is still inside the table, and it cannot be cleared unless dropping the table and re-import again.  

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
Latest master version
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
