## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Init schema:
```
CREATE TABLE t (
  a DOUBLE NULL DEFAULT '1.732088511183121',
  b datetime DEFAULT '9520-09-12 02:27:04',
  KEY idx (a)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_bin COMMENT='…comment';
```
Execute statements as follows:
conn1: 
```
alter table t change column a ddd TIME NULL DEFAULT '18:21:32' AFTER b;
```

conn2:
```
INSERT INTO t SET b = '8334-10-21 04:24:17', a = '1.9897043136824033';
DELETE FROM t;
```


|  conn1                                                     | conn2   |
-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------
| `alter table t change column a ddd TIME NULL DEFAULT '18:21:32' AFTER c;`
 ||
| |（`Write Reorg, log with sleep before DDL finishes to make async commit and 1PC safe`） INSERT INTO t SET b = '8334-10-21 04:24:17', a = '1.9897043136824033'; |
| | （`Write Reorg, log with sleep before DDL finishes to make async commit and 1PC safe`）DELETE FROM t; |

Last, check it with `select * from t use index(idx);`.
