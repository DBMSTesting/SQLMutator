Title: TiDB report store-not-found error 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. Force offline a store to turn it into a tombstone store and some regions still have peers on it.
2. TiDB doesn't cache the tombstone store's information so it will query PD.
3. TiDB returns a store-not-found error to the user.

`RegionCache` can't handle peers on a tombstone store now. If TiDB tries to access the peer, TiDB will report backoff timeout. If the tombstone information is deleted from the PD, TiDB will return a store-not-found error to the user.

BTW, `RegionCache` doesn't retry if it fails to call `GetStore`. The error will be reported to the user too.
