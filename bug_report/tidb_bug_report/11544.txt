Title: Index Join executes wrongly when there's index with column has length
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
create table t(a int);
create table tt(a int, b varchar(10), index idx(a, b(3)));
insert into t values(1);
insert into tt values(1, 'aaaaaaa'), (1, 'aaaabbb'), (1, 'aaaacccc');
select /*+ TIDB_HJ(tt) */ * from t, tt where t.a=tt.a and tt.b in ('aaaaaaa', 'aaaabbb', 'aaaacccc');
select /*+ TIDB_INLJ(tt) */ * from t, tt where t.a=tt.a and tt.b in ('aaaaaaa', 'aaaabbb', 'aaaacccc');
```

2. What did you expect to see?

Both them returns correct dataset.

3. What did you see instead?

Only hash join returned. Index join returned a empty dataset.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
