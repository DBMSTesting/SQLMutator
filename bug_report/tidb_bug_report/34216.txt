Title: `initStatsTopN4Chunk()` doesn't sort TopN for statistics sometimes
Description:
## Bug Report

As the title says, the logic of `initStatsTopN4Chunk()` is not correct. The stats for all tables are handled here, but it assumes it's handling stats on one table. The TopNs of different tables that have the same column ID are not guaranteed to be sorted.
