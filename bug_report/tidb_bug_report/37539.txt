## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
 create table t(d1 double, f float);
 insert into t values(0, 0);

| NULL                 | NULL                |
+----------------------+---------------------+
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```sql
+----------------------+---------------------+
| cast(d1 as datetime) | cast(f as datetime) |
+----------------------+---------------------+
| 0000-00-00 00:00:00  | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |
