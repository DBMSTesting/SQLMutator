Title: Changing sql_auto_is_null is a noop (unsafe)
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

I was reading through the Django source code, and noticed that it had a flag for [`sql_auto_is_null`.](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_auto_is_null) I am not sure of any applications that actually use this feature, but TiDB has a "noop" handling, which is unsafe. It should instead refuse to change the sysvar.

```sql
SET sql_auto_is_null = 1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY auto_increment, b char(20));
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL, 'b');
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id IS NULL;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```sql
mysql [localhost:5731] {msandbox} (test) > SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id IS NULL;
+----+------+
| id | b    |
+----+------+
|  1 | b    |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id IS NULL;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```


### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```sql
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
