Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
We will check the DDL owner in the following code.
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/bf8f570fcb64f0cffe3477a508dbba71d1093822/session/bootstrap.go#L1245-L1255

Then we do upgrades. But there may be an owner change case before finishing upgrades. So the judgment of the DDL job put KV or table may have miscalculation.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master
