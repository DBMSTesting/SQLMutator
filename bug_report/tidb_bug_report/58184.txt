thanks for @wshwsh12

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

before the fix, there's some warnings but the execution time is small

use v6.5.8

```
mysql> select count(1) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns;
+----------+
| count(1) |
+----------+
|     4629 |
+----------+
1 row in set, 6 warnings (0.03 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

after the fix, execution is slow

use nightly (~8.6)

```
mysql> select count(1) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns;
+----------+
| count(1) |
+----------+
|     4981 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.74 sec)
```

use v6.5.11

```
mysql> select count(1) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns;
+----------+
| count(1) |
+----------+
|     4635 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.66 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
