Looking into column `b`'s stats:
- partition `p0`: TopN: (3, 3). Hist: one bucket  [2, 2] with count = 1
- partition `p1`: TopN: (2, 3), Hist: empty
- partition `p2`: TopN: (1, 2), Hist: two buckets [1, 3] with count = 2 and repeat = 1, [4, 4] with count = 1 and repeat = 1

After fixing the global TopN, it is now 2 with 4 as its occurrence (local TopN of `p1` and one single bucket from `p0`).

Remained buckets(TopN also treat as bucket)
- [3, 3] count = 4, repeat = 4 (local TopN from `p0` plus 1 from `p2`'s bucket [1, 3]'s repeat)
- [1, 1] count = 2, repeat = 2
- [1, 3] count = 1, repeat = 0
- [4, 4] count = 1, repeat = 1

After merging them to get the global histogram, we should get one bucket [1, 4] with count = 8 and repeat = 1.
But in the current test result, we have

The count is ***10***.
