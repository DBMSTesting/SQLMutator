Title: BACKUP and RESTORE commands broken in master
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

I tried to check if an earlier bug has been fixed ( https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/17834 ) but it looks like both `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` commands are currently broken:

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE backuptest;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE backuptest.t1 (a int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> BACKUP DATABASE backuptest TO 'local:///tmp/backuptest';
ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

mysql> RESTORE DATABASE `ontime` FROM 's3://wwartmp/ontime';   
ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

mysql> RESTORE DATABASE `ontime` FROM 'local:///mnt/evo860/tmp/ontimenew';
ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Command should work.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

See output.

### 4. Affected version (Required)

```
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
