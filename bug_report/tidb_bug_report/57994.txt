Title: infoschemaV2's lifetime is limited and may cause statistics wrongly deleted
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

In a big cluster testing, the `StatsCacheImpl.Update` may execute more than 20 minutes in current situation.
It may exceeds the valid lifetime of the infoschema and raise the fake error which tells that a table doesn't exist.

It's a dangerous behavior for statistics because stats needs the infoschema to decide whether a table exists or not.
The fake error may cause the stats of a table wrongly deleted.
