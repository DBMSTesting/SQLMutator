Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Reported from https://asktug.com/t/topic/1037727
Details root cause is described in https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/9750

Reproduce steps:

1. Deploy a cluster with tikv and disaggregated tiflash (1 tiflash compute node and 1 tiflash storage node)
2. Load TPC-H dataset into the cluster and create tiflash replica
3. Create placement policy
```
CREATE PLACEMENT POLICY evict_sata_dw CONSTRAINTS="[-disk=sata-new, -disk=dw-ssd]" SURVIVAL_PREFERENCES="[host]";
ALTER TABLE test.region PLACEMENT POLICY=evict_sata_dw;
-- or alter policy globally
-- ALTER RANGE global PLACEMENT POLICY evict_sata_dw;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The placement policy applied to the table and the tidb cluster run normally

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The tiflash compute node crash as the tiflash issue descripe

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
v7.5.4
