Title: a DELETE statement using 'EXISTS' or 'IN' keyword, wrong records deleted
Description:
What did you do?
---
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
SELECT id FROM t1;

id
---
123

SELECT id FROM t2;

id
---
123

SELECT id FROM t1
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM t2);

id
---
123

-- the statement should delete the record 123, but does not
DELETE FROM t1
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM t2);

-- should not delete the record, but the record gone
DELETE FROM t1
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM t2);
```

I still can not reproduce the error, the error only happens in some of my tables.


What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V`)?

```
> $ ./tidb-server -V

The error occurs after we update to RC4.
Only DELETE statement, SELECT and UPDATE are fine.
The problem cause important data lost.
