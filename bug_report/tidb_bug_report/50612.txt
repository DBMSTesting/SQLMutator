2. execute drop index for the duplicate index, readd index 
- from `show ddl jobs` this job state is running
- but check from `mysql.tidb_background_subtask` show the new job subtask state is cancelled or reverting.
- a subtask of first ddl job is revert-pending
- check log， found the first ddl job is not cancelled
