Title: Slow log parse performance improvement for splitByColon
Description:
## Enhancement
Do cpu profile for query like:
```
SELECT
  Digest,
  Query,
  Conn_ID,
  (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(Time) + 0E0) AS timestamp,
  Query_time,
  Mem_max,
  Process_keys
FROM
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`CLUSTER_SLOW_QUERY`
WHERE
  Time BETWEEN FROM_UNIXTIME(?)
  AND FROM_UNIXTIME(?)
ORDER BY
  Query_time DESC
LIMIT 100;
```
Find the splitByColon takes about 80% cpu times:

The implementation uses regexp to parse key: value strings:

However, in most cases, we can just go through the string, and take string before colon as key, string after colon as value, which seems can improve performance significantly.
