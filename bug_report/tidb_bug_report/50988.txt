Title: `RelatedTables` returns nothing if the statement fails to build logical plan
Description:
## Bug Report

In our audit log implementation, it uses `RelatedTables` to get the tables list for latter filtering. However, if the statement fails to build logical plan, `return e.sc.Tables` will return nothing, makes the audit log filter fail to work.
