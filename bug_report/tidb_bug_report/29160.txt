Title: Different behaviour among versions when optimistic transaction meets lock of pessimistic transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

(default tiup playground)

session 1:
```
use test;
create table t(id int);
insert into t values (1);
begin; select * from t where id=1 for update;
```

session 2:
```
use test;
update t set id=2 where id=1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? && What did you see instead (Required)

Different TiDB vesions give me different behaviour.

v5.1 and v5.2:

session 2 timeout after ~10 minutes

v4.0, v5.0 and nightly:
session 2 timeout after 1~2 minutes

Both error message is:

```
ERROR 9004 (HY000): Resolve lock timeout
```
