Title: Unknown time zone 'posixrules'
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. What did you do?

Start tikv, pd and tidb on a machine with America/New_York timezone. (Ubuntu 18.04)

### 2. What did you expect to see?

TiDB starts normally.

### 3. What did you see instead?

TiDB fails to start. Return an error from tikv coprocessor: `Unknown time zone 'posixrules'`. 

This was because on some distribution, `/etc/localtime` was linked to `/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York` which was also a soft link to `/usr/share/zoneinfo/posixrules`.

Then TiKV receives `posixrules` timezone and fails to parse it. 

A simple way to fix it is to `readlink` only once (but `filepath.EvalSymlinks` actually follows the symlink recursively).
