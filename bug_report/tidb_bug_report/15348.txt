Title: performance_schema contains annoying differences from MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

I have a performance_schema GUI that I use to review MySQL slow queries. I tried to port it to TiDB, and there are annoying differences.

2. What did you expect to see?

It would be nice if there was a best effort to be MySQL compatible.

3. What did you see instead?

In the table `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest`:

* The TiDB column `EXEC_COUNT` is `COUNT_STAR` in MySQL.
* The TiDB column `SUM_LATENCY` is `SUM_TIMER_WAIT` in MySQL.
* All times in TiDB are in nanoseconds. In MySQL they are picoseconds (previously reported as #14211). I was surprised this was handled as a docs bug, it is hard to keep track of this.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
