## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql

insert into t values (cast('123121241241242515521525215525' as unsigned));
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

A warning

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

ERROR 1690 (22003): BIGINT UNSIGNED value is out of range in '123121241241242515521525215525'

TiDB uses `OverflowAsWarning` to control the behavior. However, it's not set for `INSERT` statement.
