Title: PR56660 has been merged into release-8.5 accidentally
Description:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/56660 implemented an [enhancement](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54138) for better compatibility of MySQL, and it is already merged into release-8.5, which would be a LTS version.
Although it would not change the default behavior of authentication, if the variable `default_authentication_plugin` is set to a non-default value, it could affect the whole phase of authentication when using text-based auth plugins.
We have discovered a bug caused by this PR (see https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/57391). To guarantee the quality of LTS versions, this enhancement would be better if it appeared first in the next LTS after 8.5.
