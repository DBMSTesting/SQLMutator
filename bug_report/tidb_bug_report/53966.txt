## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

When a table does not yet have statistics, use this API to export:
```
curl -s http://x.x.x.x:10080/stats/dump/test/t1 -o /tmp/t1.json
```

Then import statistics by `load stats ' '` (either the current cluster or a new cluster): 
```
load stats '/tmp/t1.json';
```

I get error:
```
mysql> load stats '/tmp/t1.json';
