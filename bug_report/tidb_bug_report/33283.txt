Title: tidb lightning progress (remaining time) not accurate
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Do lightning import 8.5TB data(60K tables) with index-concurrency = 2，table-concurrency = 6 , and check progress from tidb-lightning log
```
[root@zhengrong-24 lightning]# grep speed tidb-lightning.log.1 | tail
[2022/03/21 11:05:16.542 +08:00] [INFO] [restore.go:1206] [progress] [total=27.6%] [tables="40048/61207 (65.4%)"] [chunks="40140/145481 (27.6%)"] [engines="80098/116207 (68.9%)"] [speed(MiB/s)=11.497245396766742] [state=writing] [remaining=56h12m21s]

```
2.  Stop the import by send Crtl-C, and resume the import from checkpoint with  index-concurrency = 6，table-concurrency = 12, and check progress
```
[root@zhengrong-24 lightning]# grep speed tidb-lightning.log.2 | head

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
For the 2nd import, I increased concurrency by setting index-concurrency = 6，table-concurrency = 12, and the import speed is larger that 1st import,  so I expect remaining import time is shorter.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Remaining import time is now more than 173h, which is over 3 times of that of 1st import.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
