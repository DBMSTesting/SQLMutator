Title: small probability recursive lock (deadlock) when setting `tidb_restricted_read_only`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sh
count=0
while true; do
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -u root -e "set global tidb_restricted_read_only = 1;set global tidb_restricted_read_only = 0;";
count=$((count+1))
echo "$count"
done
```

I tried several times, in most times it can be triggered before the count reaches 5000.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Execute and finish successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The SET statement above blocks forever, and any following SET GLOBAL statements will block forever.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

I'm using v8.2.0 and master, but I believe many versions have this bug.
