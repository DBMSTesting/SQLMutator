Title: TestAbnormalMySQLTable has multiple issues.
Description:
## Bug Report

TestAbnormalMySQLTable: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/2ee8c99cff49684b67b992a43646c1c3bc06b1e2/pkg/privilege/privileges/cache_test.go#L369-L444

To me it looks like this test was meant to test if authentication in TiDB would break if someone/something would accidentally sync the mysql.user table from MySQL. However the current version doesn't match a MySQL mysql.user table anymore.

- If something like DM or any other tool would accidentaly sync the mysql.user table from MySQL to TiDB this would be a serious problem. So it might be good to test to make sure at least root can still authenticate.
- Then we should test with the mysql.user structure from MySQL 5.7, 8.0 and 8.4. Maybe also MariaDB 11.x?
- However if the table is synced then the data in it might be synced as well. This might work for caching_sha2_password or mysql_native_password. However root might use socket auth in some situations or be restricted to [127.0.0.1/::1](http://127.0.0.1/::1) which might make this more difficult. And at least MariaDB has some different auth plugins that we don't support.
- There is another solution, which I think might be better: Rely on skip_grant_tables. This should work for all root authentication issues including this one.
- I don't think we would ever officially support syncing mysql.user from a non-TiDB upstream. So this would only be a best effort action to reduce the damage.
- The test currently doesn't include versions of the mysql.user table from previous versions of TiDB.
