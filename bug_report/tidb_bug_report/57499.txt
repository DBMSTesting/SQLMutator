Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (
    a VARCHAR(255), 
    b VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO t VALUES ('-1.7E+308', '1.7E+308');

ALTER TABLE t SET TIFLASH REPLICA 1;

SELECT /*+ READ_FROM_STORAGE(TIKV[t])*/ 
    CAST(a AS DOUBLE) * CAST(b AS DOUBLE) AS result_a_b  
FROM t;

SELECT /*+ READ_FROM_STORAGE(TIFLASH[t])*/ 
    CAST(a AS DOUBLE) * CAST(b AS DOUBLE) AS result_a_b  
FROM t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The query should return the same result from two query hints, and i think it should not return zero.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
mysql> SELECT /*+ READ_FROM_STORAGE(TIFLASH[t])*/      CAST(a AS DOUBLE) * CAST(b AS DOUBLE) AS result_a_b   FROM t;
+------------+
| result_a_b |
+------------+
|          0 |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT /*+ READ_FROM_STORAGE(TIKV[t])*/      CAST(a AS DOUBLE) * CAST(b AS DOUBLE) AS result_a_b   FROM t;
ERROR 1690 (22003): DOUBLE value is out of range in '(cast(test1.t.a, double BINARY) * cast(test1.t.b, double BINARY))'
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

TiDB v8.4.0
