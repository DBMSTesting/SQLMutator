Title: plan: adjust index cost calculation algorithm.
Description:
1. When the conditions are "a in (1,2) and b in (3,4)", the count will be rounded to 0, which will cause terrible bug.
2. When the selection is pushed down and the prop has limit, we should recalculate cost for table scan and index scan.
