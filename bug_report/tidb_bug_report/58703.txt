Title: Cop task's backoff time is not appropriate in execution summary
Description:
In current tidb code, the cop task's backoff time in execution summary is not correctly calculated:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/4f78f12f347573688a73aaf9e03d4a9f72283a0a/pkg/distsql/select_result.go#L658
The backoff time in selectResultRuntimeStats is replaced by the new CopRuntimeStats's backoff time when their backoff keys are the same. It is more reasonable to sum the backoff values up here. 
Currently, the accurate backoff info can be found in the slow log item if the query is regarded as a slow query.
