```

6. server status

check cpu and io with top and iostat.  the server is very free


7. You help

Have talked to PINGCAP OP and provide the log! 
BUT, the problem is still going on. And it affect the application request.
It make us (especially my leaders)  feel that  TIDB is not stable and not worth trust。
