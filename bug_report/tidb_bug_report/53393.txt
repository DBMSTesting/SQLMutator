### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

When there is a lot of tables with AUTO_ID_CACHE=1 attribute, exit tidb takes a long time
Longer than graceful shutdown wait time

And since tidb not restart quickly, the service unavailable time increase.

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

6.5 - master (8.0)
