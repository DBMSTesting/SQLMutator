Title: Logging related to `SELECT... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` is too verbose
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

T1:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (id int primary key);
INSERT INTO t VALUES(1),(2),(3);
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM t FOR UPDATE NOWAIT;
```

T2:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM t FOR UPDATE NOWAIT;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The second transaction should fail with:
```
ERROR: 3572 (HY000): Statement aborted because lock(s) could not be acquired immediately and NOWAIT is set.
```
This is expected and should not result in much logging.



### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR: 3572 (HY000): Statement aborted because lock(s) could not be acquired immediately and NOWAIT is set.
```
```
