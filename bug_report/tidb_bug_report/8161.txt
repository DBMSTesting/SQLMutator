Title: ANY_VALUE function does not suppress group by errors
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

Make sure sql_mode='ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY' to start.  Then:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT NOT NULL, b INT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
SELECT COUNT(*) AS c, b FROM t1 GROUP BY a;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS c, ANY_VALUE(b) FROM t1 GROUP BY a;
```

2. What did you expect to see?

```
mysql57> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

mysql57> CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT NOT NULL, b INT NOT NULL);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)

mysql57> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql57> SELECT COUNT(*) AS c, b FROM t1 GROUP BY a;
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'test.t1.b' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
mysql57> SELECT COUNT(*) AS c, ANY_VALUE(b) FROM t1 GROUP BY a;
+---+--------------+
| c | ANY_VALUE(b) |
+---+--------------+
| 1 |            1 |
| 1 |            2 |
| 1 |            3 |
+---+--------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

3. What did you see instead?

```

```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
tidb> SELECT tidb_version()\G
