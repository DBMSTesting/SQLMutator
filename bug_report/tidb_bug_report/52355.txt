Title: Failed to modify column's default value when has expression index
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
mysql> create table t1 (a char(20) not null, index((lower(a))));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> alter table t1 modify a char(20) default null;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Success.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR 3106 (HY000): '[ddl:3837]Column 'a' has an expression index dependency and cannot be dropped or renamed' is not supported for generated columns.
```

This error message does not match the operation and has a poor format.

I can reproduce this error in both nightly and v7.5.1, but in serverless (`5.7.28-TiDB-v7.1.1-serverless`) it works fine.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
