Title: user variables in LOAD DATA don't work as expected
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

data.csv:
```
1,c
```

table:
```
CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `c` char(1) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```

statement:
```
load data local infile 'data.csv' into table t fields terminated by ',' (id, @c) set c=upper(@c);
```

2. What did you expect to see?

This should load the data from the file into the table, setting the value of column `c` to the uppercased value of the 2nd column in the CSV file, as occurs in MariaDB:
```
MariaDB [test]> load data local infile 'data.csv' into table t fields terminated by ',' (id, @c) set c=upper(@c);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.002 sec)
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0

MariaDB [test]> select * from t;
+----+------+
| id | c    |
+----+------+
|  1 | C    |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

3. What did you see instead?

```
TiDB [test]> load data local infile 'data.csv' into table t fields terminated by ',' (id, @c) set c=upper(@c);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0

TiDB [test]> select * from t;
+----+------+
| id | c    |
+----+------+
|  1 | NULL |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
tidb_version(): Release Version: v3.0.3
