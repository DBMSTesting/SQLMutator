## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
create table t1 (id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key);
insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1; insert into t1 (id) select null from t1;

set max_execution_time=2000;
select sleep(4); /* killed after 2s as expected */
select count(*) from t1 a join t1 b; /* killed after 2s as expected */

select sleep(10) from t1 a join t1 b; /* apparently never killed? */
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The statement should be killed after `max_execution_time` is reached.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The statement is not killed, and many messages are written to the tidb-server log:

```
[2022/08/09 17:01:28.901 -07:00] [WARN] [expensivequery.go:75] ["execution timeout, kill it"] [costTime=3m30.168889417s] [maxExecutionTime=2s] [processInfo="{id:60545707295113623, user:root, host:127.0.0.1:54593, db:test, command:Query, time:210, state:autocommit, info:select sleep(10) from t1 a join t1 b}"]
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```
