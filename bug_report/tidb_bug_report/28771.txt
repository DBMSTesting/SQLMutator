Title: integration-ddl-test failed due to timeout
Description:
Highly possibly introduced by #28423 .

Where we "pushdown" setup/teardown into cases instead of globally.

Will Prepare a hack to workaround this but hopefully we can keep the logic in the same repo as well as move the validation stage before PR merged so that we can prevent this regression.
