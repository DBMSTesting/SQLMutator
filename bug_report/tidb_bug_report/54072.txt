Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

[directory_query.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15880044/directory_query.zip)

With the plan replayer file above

plan replayer load '/tmp/directory_query.zip';

Set tidb_opt_enable_hash_join to off and run query.

```
mysql> set session tidb_opt_enable_hash_join = "off";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain WITH RECURSIVE ancestors(gid) AS (    SELECT     groupings.parentId   FROM     groupings   WHERE     (       groupings.userId = 8329216799209537       OR groupings.groupId = 8329216799209537     )     AND groupings.parentId IN (       SELECT         groupId       FROM         `groups`       WHERE         `groups`.workspaceid = 4094233125760157         OR `groups`.accountId = '02945107-4221-4317-9276-5e0e9ed7f194'     )     AND groupings.internal_deleted_timestamp IS NULL   UNION   SELECT     groupings.parentId   FROM     groupings     JOIN ancestors ON groupings.groupId = ancestors.gid ),workspaceScopedGroups(gid) AS (   SELECT     groupId   FROM     principalToWorkspace   WHERE     groupId IN (       SELECT         gid       FROM         ancestors     )     AND principalToWorkspace.deleted = false     AND principalToWorkspace.workspaceId = 4094233125760157   UNION   SELECT     groupings.groupId   FROM     groupings     JOIN workspaceScopedGroups ON groupings.parentId = workspaceScopedGroups.gid   WHERE     groupings.groupId IN (       SELECT         gid
    FROM         ancestors     ) ) SELECT   `groups`.groupId AS "`groups`.groupId",   `groups`.groupname AS "`groups`.groupname",   `groups`.externalId AS "`groups`.externalId",   `groups`.creationTime AS "`groups`.creationTime",   `groups`.groupuuid AS "`groups`.groupuuid",   `groups`.accountId AS "`groups`.accountId",   `groups`.syncedBy AS "`groups`.syncedBy",   `groups`.sourceIdp AS "`groups`.sourceIdp" FROM   `groups` WHERE   `groups`.groupId IN (     SELECT       gid     FROM       workspaceScopedGroups   );
ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

With  set session tidb_opt_enable_hash_join = "on" , there is no such error

No ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

I expect tidb_opt_enable_hash_join=off not cause invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

No ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

master(8.2+) ,  v7.5.1
