Title: Status port does not work when cluster-TLS (SSL) is enabled
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

<details><summary>Start TiDB with cluster TLS:</summary>

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
export MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=\*

# Generate certs

cat - > ipsan.cnf <<EOF
[dn]
CN = localhost
[req]
distinguished_name = dn
[EXT]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
keyUsage = digitalSignature
extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth,serverAuth
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
EOF

openssl ecparam -out ca.key -name prime256v1 -genkey
openssl req -new -batch -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost' -key ca.key -out ca.csr
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 2 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.pem 2> /dev/null

openssl ecparam -out cluster.key -name prime256v1 -genkey
openssl req -new -batch -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost' -key cluster.key -out cluster.csr
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 1 -extensions EXT -extfile ipsan.cnf -in cluster.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out cluster.pem 2> /dev/null

# Start TiDB

cat - > tidb-config.toml <<EOF
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 4000
[status]
status-host = "127.0.0.1"
status-port = 10080
[security]
cluster-ssl-ca = "ca.pem"
cluster-ssl-cert = "cluster.pem"
cluster-ssl-key = "cluster.key"
EOF

../bin/tidb-server --config tidb-config.toml
```

</details>

Then try to connect to the status port

```sh
curl --cacert ca.pem 'https://127.0.0.1:10080/status'
```

2. What did you expect to see?

JSON output like 

```
{"connections":0,"version":"5.7.25-TiDB-v4.0.0-beta-136-g8c804f40d","git_hash":"8c804f40dda5ef231a73f459ecd812fb135b9fba"}
```

3. What did you see instead?

Connecting using HTTP/2 returned failure:

```
curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: INTERNAL_ERROR (err 2)
```

Furthermore, connecting using HTTP/1.1 does not succeed either, and the server is definitely serving HTTPS.

```console
$ curl --http1.1 --cacert ca.pem 'https://127.0.0.1:10080/status'
curl: (1) Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed

$ curl --http0.9 --cacert ca.pem 'https://127.0.0.1:10080/status'
curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: INTERNAL_ERROR (err 2)

$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:10080/status'
Client sent an HTTP request to an HTTPS server.
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection was reset
```

Note that the gRPC server on the same port works correctly via TLS.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

master version
