Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
use INFORMATION_SCHEMA;
show full tables;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```sql
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
| Tables_in_information_schema          | Table_type  |
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
| ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS     | SYSTEM VIEW |
| APPLICABLE_ROLES                      | SYSTEM VIEW |
| CHARACTER_SETS                        | SYSTEM VIEW |
| CHECK_CONSTRAINTS                     | SYSTEM VIEW |
| COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY | SYSTEM VIEW |
...
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
+---------------------------------------+------------+
| Tables_in_information_schema          | Table_type |
+---------------------------------------+------------+
| ANALYZE_STATUS                        | BASE TABLE |
| CHARACTER_SETS                        | BASE TABLE |
| CLUSTER_CONFIG                        | BASE TABLE |
| CLUSTER_HARDWARE                      | BASE TABLE |
| CLUSTER_INFO                          | BASE TABLE |
| CLUSTER_LOAD                          | BASE TABLE |
| CLUSTER_LOG                           | BASE TABLE |
```

Note that selecting from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` displays correctly:

```sql
mysql> select TABLE_NAME, TABLE_TYPE from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA';
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
| TABLE_NAME                            | TABLE_TYPE  |
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
| VIEWS                                 | SYSTEM VIEW |
| STATEMENTS_SUMMARY                    | SYSTEM VIEW |
| COLUMNS                               | SYSTEM VIEW |
| SESSION_VARIABLES                     | SYSTEM VIEW |
| TABLE_PRIVILEGES                      | SYSTEM VIEW |
| ENGINES                               | SYSTEM VIEW |
| PROCESSLIST                           | SYSTEM VIEW |
| TIFLASH_REPLICA                       | SYSTEM VIEW |
| CHARACTER_SETS                        | SYSTEM VIEW |
| SCHEMA_PRIVILEGES                     | SYSTEM VIEW |
| ROUTINES                              | SYSTEM VIEW |
| CLUSTER_CONFIG                        | SYSTEM VIEW |
| CLUSTER_PROCESSLIST                   | SYSTEM VIEW |
