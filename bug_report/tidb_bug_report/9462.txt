Title: SHOW CREATE USER syntax creates non-creatable users
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

Ran `show create user`, and pasted the output back to the shell:
```
show create user 'root';
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' AS '' REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
```

The command `show create user` was added in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9240 , but unfortunately it creates a MySQL 5.7 compatible output which TiDB does not yet parse.  See also: https://github.com/pingcap/parser/issues/158 for matching parser bug.

2. What did you expect to see?

Pasting the output create user in MySQL 5.7 works fine:

```
mysql [localhost:5725]> CREATE USER 'abcd'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' AS '' REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

3. What did you see instead?

```
mysql> CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' AS '' REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 76 near "REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK" 
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
