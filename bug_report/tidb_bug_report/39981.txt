Title: DDL jobs may be blocked if TiDB server restart
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
If TiDB owner restart and some DDL isn't finished, the waitSchemaSynced will wait for the latest schema version, but it does equal to the DDL's latest version. 
For example, a DDL latest version is 10, and another DDL updates the global version to 11. 
In waitSchemaSynced, it will wait for 11, but UpdateSelfVersion() only writes 10 for this DDL. Then this DDL is blocked forever.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

6.3 6.4 6.5 master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
