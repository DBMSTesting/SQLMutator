Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
deploy the tidb v5.0.0-nightly cluster with 4 kv,2 tiflash,3 pd,2 db
br restore the TPCC 10000 warehouses（no tiflash data） to cluster
In the process of restore，alter the tpcc tables tiflash replica 2 ; Then execute sqls like "select count(*) from district;"
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The result of TiFlash and Tikv is same
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
When the table is not ready
using TiKV engine, the result is 0 and the time of query is quickly.
```
MySQL [tpcc]> select count(*) from district;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
While using TiFlash engine, the result is different and the time of query is very long.
```
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Region epoch not match after retries: Region {80196,13,172} not in region cache.
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
