Title: Cluster configuration is not comparable through `show variables`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Execute `show variables;` on a new cluster, and one that has been upgraded.

They can have very different behaviors because of the following 2 system variables which are hidden:
- tidb_enable_paging
- tidb_enable_mutation_checker

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I expect in the case of both of this variables they should be visible. The problem is that mutation checker, is only enabled for new clusters (and not old), and paging if enabled for new clusters and very old clusters, but possibly not for clusters that stepped through a version when paging was first introduced but off by default.

Hidden variables should not be permitted at all, but the issue here is you have made hidden variables which are very influential of cluster behavior. When debugging an issue where 2 clusters are different - I am going to compare configuration and see no difference. This is really damaging to my ability to debug.

Both of this variables are also documented in the manual, which makes even less sense why they are hidden in the server. Please stop doing this, it is really anti-user.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

visible variables

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
