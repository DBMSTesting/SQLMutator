Title: planner: use the wrong memory-usage value when evicting plan-cache
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

The optimizer has a memory protection strategy that if the server's memory usage is higher than a specified proportion(90% by default) the optimizer can evict the LRU plan-cache.

But when calculating the proportion, the optimizer uses a wrong formula `system-mem-usage / max-tidb-mem` instead of `tidb-mem-usage / max-tidb-mem`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
