Title: TopSQL & statement summary use a lot of memory
Description:
## General Question

We test tidb with [sqllogic](https://github.com/pingcap/test-plan/blob/main/transaction/sqllogic.yaml) daily and it [fails recently](https://tcms.pingcap.net/dashboard/executions/plan?query=sqllogic&page=1&pageSize=20). The case fails because the tidb gets OOM killed and it seems that the memory is maily used by topsql & statement summary.
