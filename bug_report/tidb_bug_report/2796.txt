Title: plan: fix bug about column prunning.
Description:
Like query `select b from (select a,b from t union all select a, b from t order by a) t`, after column pruning, the left side of union became select a, but the right side one is still a, b, which may cause a panic.
So we add a projection to every side of union to avoid this case. Fix #2794
