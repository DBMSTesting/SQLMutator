Title: lightning should notify user if there is error during import
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Use lightning to import data with errors, and specify max-error parameters >= the number of actually errors.

For example, set max-error = 2 and sql-mode = "STRICT_TRANS_TABLES" for below data with 2 errors:
```
[root@centos76_vm max_error]# cat max_error.t2-schema.sql
/*!40101 SET NAMES binary*/;
CREATE TABLE `t2` (
  `a` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `b` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
  `c` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`a`) /*T![clustered_index] CLUSTERED */,
  UNIQUE KEY `uk_b` (`b`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin;
[root@centos76_vm max_error]# cat max_error.t2.000000000.csv
"a","b","c"
1,"b1","2021-11-14 00:00:00"
"xxx","b2","2021-11-15 00:00:00"
3,"b3","0"
4,"b4","2021-11-17 00:00:00"

```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
There should be some warning in console output and end of the lightning log file to let user know that there are errors during import.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
No warning in console output or log file, user might think that the import were successful.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
