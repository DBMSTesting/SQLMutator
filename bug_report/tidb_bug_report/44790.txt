Title: getCgroupCPU() v1 logic doesn't work with CPU controller that appears like 'cpuacct,cpu' in /proc/self/cgroup and /proc/self/mountinfo
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

With some Linux releases like RHEL 7.9, the cpu controller appears like 'cpuacct,cpu' rather than 'cpu,cpuacct'. Obviously, the logic doesn't work in such case. In cgroup_mock_test.go, try replacing 'cpu,cpuacct' with 'cpuacct,cpu' in the v1 cgroup files and 'rw,cpu,cpuacct' with 'rw,cpuacct,cpu' in the v1 mountinfo files, the test will fail.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The API works in the case mentioned above.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The API doesn't work.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.5.1
