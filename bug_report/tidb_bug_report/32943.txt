Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

When a pessimistic transaction contains non-locked keys (such as non-unique index keys), and it's rolled back by a conflicting transaction and then a newer version is written on the key, there might be false-positive assertion failure reported.

See https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/12113 for details.

This bug will be fixed in TiKV and client-go. TiDB needs to update client-go dependency.
