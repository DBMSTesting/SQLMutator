Title: util: potential double lock in `Tracker.remove` if `rootExceed == t`
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. What did you do?

Analyze the functions in util/memory/tracker.go.
Find a path that leads to double-lock.

The first lock is `t.mu.Lock()` in `remove()`. 
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b0ce4131ce67c39a41d3d20df9d888fe9bc5a650/util/memory/tracker.go#L155-L163
Then `remove()` calls `t.Consume()`.
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b0ce4131ce67c39a41d3d20df9d888fe9bc5a650/util/memory/tracker.go#L201-L205
```     
        var rootExceed *Tracker
	for tracker := t
        rootExceed = tracker
```
There is a path that leads to `rootExceed == t`.
If that is the case, `Action(rootExceed)` is equal to `Action(t)`.

Then `Action()` calls `t.String()`.
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b0ce4131ce67c39a41d3d20df9d888fe9bc5a650/util/memory/action.go#L61

Then `t.toString()`.
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b0ce4131ce67c39a41d3d20df9d888fe9bc5a650/util/memory/tracker.go#L252-L254

The second lock is `t.mu.Lock()` in `toString()`.
