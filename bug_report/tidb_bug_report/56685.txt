### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
for the integration test `db_partition.test`, the `exchange partition` will fail with `Found a row that does not match the partition`, it's expected, but info schema report "failed to load schema diff" and do full load, this part is not.
```
CREATE TABLE t1 (
	d date NOT NULL ,
	name varchar(10)  NOT NULL,
	UNIQUE KEY (d,name)
);
CREATE TABLE t1p (
	d date NOT NULL ,
	name varchar(10)  NOT NULL,
	UNIQUE KEY (d,name)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(d)
(PARTITION p202307 VALUES LESS THAN ('2023-08-01'),
 PARTITION p202308 VALUES LESS THAN ('2023-09-01'),
 PARTITION p202309 VALUES LESS THAN ('2023-10-01'),
 PARTITION p202310 VALUES LESS THAN ('2023-11-01'),
 PARTITION p202311 VALUES LESS THAN ('2023-12-01'),
 PARTITION p202312 VALUES LESS THAN ('2024-01-01'),
 PARTITION pfuture VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE));
insert into t1 values ("2023-08-06","0000");
-- error 1737
alter table t1p exchange partition p202307 with table t1 with validation;
```
