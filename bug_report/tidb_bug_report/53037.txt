Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

backup job, `Backup`, and `VolumeBackup` should fail. We don't expect these failures to resolve (in fact there is separate status for recoverable errors)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

backup job runs indefinitely until manual cleanup

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.5.4
