Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
The simple Java code looks something like thisï¼š
```
            String preSql = "select * from t where a = ?";
            PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(preSql, ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
            ps.setFetchSize(1);
            ps.setLong(1, 0);
            ResultSet rs =  ps.executeQuery();

            System.out.println("wait IO");
            Thread.sleep(24000L); 

            rs.close(); // Or exit the process in another way.
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Maybe only the executed time of ComExec.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`Query_time` in the slow query log is sleep time(here is 24s).

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
