Title: UPDATE statement with CAST() reports an error in the transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
/* init */ CREATE TABLE t(c0 INT);
/* init */ INSERT IGNORE INTO t VALUES (2);

/* tx */ BEGIN;
/* tx */ DELETE FROM t WHERE TRUE;
/* tx */ UPDATE t SET c0=0 WHERE (CAST('a' AS SIGNED)); -- report an error
/* tx */ COMMIT;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

UPDATE statement does not report error:
```sql
tidb> DELETE FROM t WHERE TRUE;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

tidb> UPDATE t SET c0=0 WHERE (CAST('a' AS SIGNED));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 0  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Executing UPDATE statement after the DELETE statement in tx reports an error:
```sql
tidb> UPDATE t SET c0=0 WHERE (CAST('a' AS SIGNED));
ERROR 1292 (22007): Truncated incorrect INTEGER value: 'a'
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
