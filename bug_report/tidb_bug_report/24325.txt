Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT, b INT) ENGINE=MyISAM;
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, NULL),(3, 4);
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
``` sql
mysql> (SELECT a, sum(a) AS f FROM v1 group by a ORDER BY b + 1)
    -> UNION
    -> (SELECT 2, 2) order by a, f;
+------+------+
| a    | f    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
|    2 |    2 |
|    3 |    3 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
``` sql
tidb> (SELECT a, sum(a) AS f FROM v1 group by a ORDER BY b + 1) UNION (SELECT 2, 2) order by a, f;
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of ORDER BY is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column '' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
