It'll cause unexpected results when upgrading from V4.0 to V5.0.
The following things need to be done to solve this problem.
- [ ] Define unoverlapped ranges of bootstrapVer numbers for the different release versions.
- [ ] Add version range check for the bootstrapVer.
- [ ] Make sure all the upgrade operations are reentrant.
