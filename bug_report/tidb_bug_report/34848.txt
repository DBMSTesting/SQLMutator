Title: default values of system variable "tidb_enable_prepared_plan_cache " and " tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size " are incorrect after upgrade
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

install a v6.0.0 tidb cluster without doing any configuration
upgrade to nightly(v6.1.0)
check default value of system variable

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
tidb_enable_prepared_plan_cache	ON
tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size	100

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Our current processing behavior is that if a configuration item has not been specifically configured before the upgrade, the value of the configuration item after the upgrade should be the same as the default value of the newly installed cluster.
in v6.1.0, these two default values have changed to "ON" and "100"

after upgrade, the default value is:
tidb_enable_prepared_plan_cache	OFF
tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size	1000

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
