Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```SQL
set global tidb_analyze_version = 1;
use test;
CREATE TABLE t ( a int, b int, c int default 0)
  PARTITION BY RANGE (a) (
  PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
  PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20),
  PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (30),
  PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (40));
INSERT INTO t(a, b) values(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (15, 15), (25, 25), (35, 35);
ALTER TABLE t ADD UNIQUE INDEX idx(b);
set global tidb_partition_prune_mode = "dynamic";
```
