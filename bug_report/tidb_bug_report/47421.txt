Title: Resource control quota maybe exceed in some scenarios
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
some workloads run together and set ru limit
tpcc 80k limit and the workload fluctuates around 80k, with a maximum reaching 88k.
It is somewhat related to the current implementation. When a request comes in, the RU consumption is added first, rather than after wait. In the case of tpcc, the write RU consumption is relatively high with request. It indicates a small peak, exceeding 10%.
