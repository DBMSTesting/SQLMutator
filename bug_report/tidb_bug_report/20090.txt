Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

When  I set the `cross-join = false` in TiDB. I found that it will raise the error " Cartesian product is unsupported ", even though having the condition of both sides tables, when having a where condition of join column with a constant.
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
MySQL [test]> create table t1 (id bigint,c1 varchar(10));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

MySQL [test]> create table t2 (id bigint,c1 varchar(10));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

MySQL [test]> insert into t1 values (1,'abc'),(2,'cdef');
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

MySQL [test]> insert into t2 values (1,'fffg'),(2,'gggh');
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

MySQL [test]> select * from t1 inner join t2 on t1.id = t2.id;
+------+------+------+------+
| id   | c1   | id   | c1   |
+------+------+------+------+
|    1 | abc  |    1 | fffg |
|    2 | cdef |    2 | gggh |
+------+------+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)

MySQL [test]> select * from t1 inner join t2 on 1=1;
ERROR 8110 (HY000): Cartesian product is unsupported
MySQL [test]> select * from t1 inner join t2 on t1.id = t2.id where t1.id = 1;
ERROR 8110 (HY000): Cartesian product is unsupported
