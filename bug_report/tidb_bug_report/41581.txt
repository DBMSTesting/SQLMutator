## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```
init
set global tidb_txn_mode = 'pessimistic';
set global tx_isolation = 'READ-COMMITTED';
create table t(a int key, b int);
```

```
session 1
begin pessimistic;

session 2
insert into t values(5, 5);

session 1
update t set b = 22 where a = 5;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
mysql> update t set b = 22 where a = 5;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

mysql> update t set b = 22 where a = 5;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 0  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0
```
The update could not read the latest data, this is possibly a bug introduced during the refactoring of the transaction module in tidb, after https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/34702 the bug is fixed, but v6.1.x and v6.0.0 are affected.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
tidb v6.0.0 v6.1.x

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
