Title: The efficiency of auto analyze is low with auto_analyze_priority_queue and infoSchemaV2 open in million tables scenario

## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
tidb_schema_cache_size 2GB
create 100k schemas and about 15 tables each of schema. 1.5 million tables totally
insert data for above tables
It takes about 10 minutes to execute a single analyze task on average when auto_analyze_priority_queue and infoSchemaV2 open. While 20 analyze tasks are executed per minute when auto_analyze_priority_queue or infoSchemaV2 close.
Currently, the automatic statistics collection task priority queue feature retrieves all table information each time it performs an `analyze`, selecting one from them to execute. If some tables are not in the `infoschema` cache, this process is quite time-consuming.
