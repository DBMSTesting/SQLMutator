Title: ddl: placement rules in SQL is not compatible with TiFlash
Description:
## Bug Report

When PD schedules a partition to tiflash, TiFlash will validate the keyrange if there is a `_r` suffix.

But placement rules are not compatible with the old `set tiflash replica` syntax too, so we should forbid using +engine=tiflash, and should add -engine=tiflash to every rule to avoid schedules to tiflash instance.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. `tiup playground` with at lease 3 tikv instances.
2. add a random placement rule with the label `+engine=tiflash`. E.g `alter table t alter partition p0 add placement policy role=follower replicas=1 constraints='["+engine=tiflash"]'`.

1. `tiup playground` with at lease 3 tikv instances.
2. `alter table t set tiflash replica 3`
3. `alter table t alter partition p0 add placement policy role=follower replicas=1 constraints='["+engine=tiflash"]'`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The first example should work fine. In the 2nd example, 3 should fail.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

TiFlash crashed.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Newest nightly.
