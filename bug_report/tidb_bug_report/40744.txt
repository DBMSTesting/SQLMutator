Title: Lightning cannot Import CSV files with UTF-8 BOM
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. Generate a CSV file and the schema file.  In the CSV file, the head of the file contains a UTF-8 BOM (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF).
Here's an example of the CSV file: 
```csv
"id","val1"
1,"aaa01"
2,"aaa01"
3,"aaa02"
4,"aaa02"
5,"aaa05"
```

Here's the binary representation of the file:
```bash
$ xxd src-data/bom-data/mytest.testtbl.csv
# result: 
# 00000000: efbb bf22 6964 222c 2276 616c 3122 0a31  ..."id","val1".1
# 00000010: 2c22 6161 6130 3122 0a32 2c22 6161 6130  ,"aaa01".2,"aaa0
# 00000020: 3122 0a33 2c22 6161 6130 3222 0a34 2c22  1".3,"aaa02".4,"
# 00000030: 6161 6130 3222 0a35 2c22 6161 6130 3522  aaa02".5,"aaa05"
# 00000040: 0a
```

3. Import data using Lightning

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The import should succeed

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The import failed.  Failure message: 
tidb lightning encountered error: [Lightning:Restore:ErrEncodeKV]encode kv error in file mytest.testtbl.csv:0 at offset 4: syntax error: cannot have consecutive fields without separator

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
