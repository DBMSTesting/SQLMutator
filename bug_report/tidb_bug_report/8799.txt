Title: An online TiDB Server uses too many memories without oom action
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

We have three online tidb-servers running, one server suddenly starts to consume memories.
No suspicious query was found, and tidb log shows no oom. (oom action is `log`, and `mem-quota-query` is using default value, which is 32G )

While I was on the way to office, my colleague force kill the server in `10:25`, so there is no other dump log available.

After the restart, server came normal.
