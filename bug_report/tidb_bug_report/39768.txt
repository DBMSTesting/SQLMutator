Title: Cannot use ingest mode to add index after cancelling
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Create an add index job with ingest mode.
2. Cancel the job before it is complete.
3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 for multiple times(Because sometimes the cancelling operation don't trigger this bug).
4. The new add index jobs always fallback to `txn-merge` because the ingest job is kept in memory.

```
["[ddl-ingest] ingest backfill is already in use by another DDL job"] ["job ID"=249]
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

When the DDL job is complete, new adding index jobs should use ingest mode.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The opposite.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
