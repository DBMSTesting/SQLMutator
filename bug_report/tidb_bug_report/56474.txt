Title: `ER_QUERY_TIMEOUT` error not returned when read query exceeding `max_execution_time`
Description:
## Bug Report
I am using MySQL node js driver to connect to TiDb, I have set `max_execution_time` as 5seconds and when I running a `select sleep (40)` query, I am not getting any error.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. `set max_execution_time = 5000`
2.  Run `SELECT 1, SLEEP(40)`

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
I expected to see an error like `ER_QUERY_TIMEOUT`
```
ERROR 3024 (HY000): Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
TiDb gave a warning and there was no error from the MYSQL library. TiDb Logs can be found below
