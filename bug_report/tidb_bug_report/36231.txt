Title: TiFlash's table scan will not support `KeepOrder` anymore
Description:
## Bug Report

In TiDB, it's assumed that when in cop mode, [TiFlash's table scan support `KeepOrder`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/ce4edc9df4004ab76b10b9c9418a1379d1be4ece/planner/core/find_best_task.go#L1875), however, after https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/5376, TiFlash will not support `KeepOrder` even in cop mode, we should disable the related plan.
