Title: Inaccurate runtime information for multi-region requests
Description:
## Bug Report

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/18666 and https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/19547 collect the backoff information for batch-get and lock-keys operation, but if an operation involves more than one region, the backoffer will be forked and the backoff information is not accurate because we only collect the information of the root backoffer.

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11757 solves it for 2PC committer by a mutex and atomic variable.
