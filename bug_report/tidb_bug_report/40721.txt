Title: combine two digits as one digit in "between and" 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->


```go

import (
	"testing"
)

import (
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func Test1(t *testing.T) {
	sql := "select id, name from multi_table where name between '10' '100' and '1'"
	stmt, err := ParseSQL(sql)
	assert.Nil(t, err)
	t.Logf("%#v", stmt)
	assert.True(t, stmt.(*ast.SelectStmt).Where.(*ast.BetweenExpr).Left.(*test_driver.ValueExpr).Datum.GetString() == "10100")
}
```

as above, the tidb parser combine the two chars '10' '100' as one word '10100'.

after debug the parser, I got the bug source:

And I also test the older parser https://github.com/pingcap/parser,  it also has the same problem.
