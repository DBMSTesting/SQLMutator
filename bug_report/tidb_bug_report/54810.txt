Description:
## Bug Report

I execute the same statement in tidb and mysql. There may be bugs in there
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (c1 double);
insert into t values (1.01);


SELECT f1 FROM t AS t1 JOIN (SELECT (c1+DATE_SUB('2018-05-17', INTERVAL 1 DAY_MICROSECOND)) AS f1 FROM t) AS t2 ON true; 

```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
It returns the following result in mysql:
```
