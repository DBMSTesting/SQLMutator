In the phpmyadmin intferace, when I click the **New** button, it execute a `SELECT` query, but failed.

```sql

    BINARY s.SCHEMA_NAME AS BIN_NAME,
    s.DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME
FROM `information_schema`.SCHEMATA s 
GROUP BY s.SCHEMA_NAME, s.DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME
ORDER BY BINARY `SCHEMA_NAME` ASC
``` 

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No error.

It seems that TiDB doesn't support `GROUP BY`  with column that has a `BINARY` qualifier.

The user of phpmyadmin will get an error as follows:

Error message:

```
#1055 - Expression #1 of ORDER BY is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column '' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
