Title: Join probe time includes the time of sending result to channel and getting avaliable empty chunk, which makes the probe time distorted
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
In explain analyze, if a here is join operator, it will record `probe_time` which indicates how much times does the probe process takes.
```
build_hash_table:{total:4.64s, fetch:4.64s, build:0s}, probe:{concurrency:5, total:1m49.5s, max:21.9s, probe:18.9s, fetch:1m30.6s}
```
However, this probe time actually includes the time of sending results to channel and getting avaliable emtpy chunk

So if the parent operator of join is slow(like high cardinality aggregation), the probe time will be very high, which is distorted and misleading.
