It directly uses the condition `no row in mysql.stats_histograms` without checking whether the table meta exists to decide the existence the of table.

But actually, due to poor cooperation with the DDL module. It's possible that we lost the records in mysql.stats_histograms for a table if there are plenty of DDLs executed in a row.
