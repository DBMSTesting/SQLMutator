Title: br: default backup parameter table-concurrency is too high
Description:
## Bug Report


### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Run BR backup

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

We expect BR backup should use some cpu/io resource, but not too high to impact cluster fuction

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

There is a spike at the beginning of checksum stage. It caused a production outage of a paid customer. Further analysis find that default value for table-concurrency is 64, and default value for checksum-concurrency is 4. This caused a total concurrency of 256 of intensive cpu/io utilization. 

Since 8.5 BR backup checksum is disabled by default. However there is still lack of documentation on table-concurrency and checksum-concurrency, users may risk cluster outage when performing BR backup with checksum enabled.

The default value of table-concurrency should be reduced to a level that it is safe to run without adjusting it, but allow user to increase if they want better performance.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
