Title: Jepsen monotonic workload failed
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Run jepsen monotonic workload

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The test exit without error

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

An anomaly detected
```
Let:
  T1 = {:type :ok, :f :read, :value {0 206, 1 197, 2 203, 3 225, 4 241, 5 212, 6 206, 7 218}, :process 182, :time 44179471687, :txn-info {:start_ts 426414278734774459}, :index 7004}
  T2 = {:type :ok, :f :read, :value {0 207, 1 193, 2 199, 3 223, 4 238, 5 210, 6 203, 7 212}, :process 69, :time 39705574426, :txn-info {:start_ts 426414276113336160}, :index 6928}
  T3 = {:type :ok, :f :read, :value {0 206, 1 197, 2 201, 3 225, 4 240, 5 210, 6 203, 7 216}, :process 37, :time 40168975373, :txn-info {:start_ts 426414276113336466}, :index 6944}

Then:
  - T1 < T2, because T1 observed 0 = 206, and T2 observed a higher value 207.
  - T2 < T3, because T2 observed 1 = 193, and T3 observed a higher value 197.
  - However, T3 < T1, because T3 observed 2 = 201, and T1 observed a higher value 203: a contradiction!
```

It seems the following transaction has been committed twice.
```
[txnStartTS=426414273465945201] [forUpdateTS=426414273465945201] [isReadConsistency=false] [current_db=test] [txn_mode=PESSIMISTIC] [sql= "UPDATE cycle SET val = 206 WHERE sk = 0"]
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master
