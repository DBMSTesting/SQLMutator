Title: Potential error in 'chunk_executor'  
Description:
I'm working on #5244.  I found there's something wrong for `VectorizedFilter` in `chunk_executor`.
`VectorizedFilter` evaluate filter result using the following sentence:
```go
filterResult, isNull, err := filter.EvalInt(row, ctx.GetSessionVars().StmtCtx)
```
which does't work for predicates like the following sql(see line 436, executor/aggregate_test.go):

```sql
select sum(c1) from t group by c1 having sum(c1)
```

the predicate is a column-ref which type is not int. The result of `EvalInt` may be not as expected here.
