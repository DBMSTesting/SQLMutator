Title: The server should not be set to a healthy state when it is not started
Description:
When initializing the struct of the server, health is set to true by default

But there is a lot of preparation work after starting the server, and at this time, the service cannot be set to healthy, otherwise it may cause errors. It can be set to healthy after initialization is completed.
