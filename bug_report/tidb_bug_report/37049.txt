Title: (*MPPDataPacket).Unmarshal consumes too much memory and causes OOM
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
When generating the table `lineorder_flat` for SSB test, first use dumpling to export the join results and then use lightning to import the join results to TiDB. The first step(dumpling) can cause OOM when TiDB Server has 64GB memory. The join results are about 6 billion rows.
```
nohup ./dumpling -u root -P 4000 -h 127.0.0.1 --filetype csv -t 4 -r 8 -o /home/lineorder_flat -F256MiB --params "tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency=5,tidb_enable_chunk_rpc=0" --sql 'use ssb;set @@tidb_batch_insert=on;set @@global.tidb_enable_batch_dml=1;set @@tidb_dml_batch_size=1000;SELECT

```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Dumpling exports the join results successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
OOM occurs when dumpling is exporting the join results. We can see from memory profiling that `(*MPPDataPacket).Unmarshal` consumes too much memory.
