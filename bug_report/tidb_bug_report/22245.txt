Title: GC may miss locks when the region is merged between scanning locks and resolving locks
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### Report
To reduce GC scanning locks, GC worker keeps resolving locks as long as all locks are in the same region even if the region is changed in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/18385. However, if the region is merged which causes the key range of the region is changed, GC worker will use the end key of the new region to scan locks in the next round. Some key ranges are missed.

### Affected version
v3.0.19-v3.0.20, v3.1.3, v4.0.5-v4.0.9, v5.0.0-rc, master
