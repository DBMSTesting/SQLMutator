Title: Inconsistent row count estimation between lite stats init and non-lite init when table has no stats
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

create a small table and insert some rows
```
create table t(a int);
insert into t values(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10);
```

Wait for a while after the stats delta is updated.

Then run `explain select * from t where a in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7,8)` with and without setting `lite-init-stats` in config to false(default is true).

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Estimation is the same, both is `0.08` while the full scan is `10`. (0.08 = 10 * 1/1000 * 8)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The lite init got

8 = 10 * 0.8(defaultSelectivityFactor)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
current master.

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
