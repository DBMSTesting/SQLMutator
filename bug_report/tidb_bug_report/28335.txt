Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
create table t(a int, b int);
insert into t values(null, 1), (null, 2), (null, 3);

/* s1 */ begin; 
/* s1 */ update t set a = 10; 
/* s2 */ begin; 
/* s2 */ update t set b = 20 where a;
/* s1 */ commit;
/* s2 */ commit;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In MySQL 8.0.26, the UPDATE of session2 will be blocked, and the final state of table is like

```
mysql> select * from t;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|   10 |   20 |
|   10 |   20 |
|   10 |   20 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
tidb> select * from t;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|   10 |    1 |
|   10 |    2 |
|   10 |    3 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```
mysql> select version();
+--------------------+
| version()          |
+--------------------+
| 5.7.25-TiDB-v5.2.1 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
