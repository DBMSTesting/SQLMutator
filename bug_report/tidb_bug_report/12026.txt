Title: TiDB nodes get many time-wait after enabling haproxy mysql-check
Description:
We use haproxy mysql-check as the service health checker. After enabling haproxy mysql-check function, i found that there are too many time-wait connection in my TiDB node, but can't find any sessions in TiDB.
I'm so confused why there are so many time-wait connection here.

TiDB Version: v3.0.2
HAProxy Version: both 1.9.8 and 2.0.5

Below is our haproxy configuration:

> listen tidb
    bind 0.0.0.0:3306
    mode tcp
    option tcplog
    maxconn 4096
    timeout client 60s
    timeout client-fin 60s
    timeout connect 3s
    timeout server 60s
    timeout tunnel 1800s
    timeout queue 60s
    balance leastconn
    retries 3
    option mysql-check user haproxy_check
    server h1 h1:4000 check rise 3 fall 3 maxconn 1024 maxqueue 512
    server h2 h2:4000 check rise 3 fall 3 maxconn 1024 maxqueue 512
    server h3 h3:4000 check rise 3 fall 3 maxconn 1024 maxqueue 512
