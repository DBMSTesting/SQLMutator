Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. -->

It is found that join reorder has a probability that the order of the `Schema.Columns` of the Join operator and the son of the Join operator (another Join operator) will be different.

A better case should be appended into this issue, @winoros 
### 2. What did you expect to see?

### 3. What did you see instead?

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
