Title: mpp: avg(null) returns error
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
create table test.t (id int, value decimal(6,3));
alter table test.t set tiflash replica 1;
insert into test.t values(1,null),
 select avg(value) from t group by id;

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
error: divided by zero
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
1 null
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master

## root cause
avg(value) is converted to if(count(value)=0, null, sum(value)/count(value))
clickhouse executes each branch of conditional expressions, so unnecessary errors occur.
