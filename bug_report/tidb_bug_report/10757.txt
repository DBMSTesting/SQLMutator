Title: Tidb failed to write binlog sometimes
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
We deployed a binlog-cluster for sync data from tidb to Elasticsearch. 


2. What did you expect to see?
The tidb server is always writing binlog successfully.


3. What did you see instead?
It works at most of the times, but sometimes it writes a log `write binlog fail but error ignored` and stops writing binlog anymore. While we didn't find a related log in the pump's and drainer's log.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
v2.1.2
