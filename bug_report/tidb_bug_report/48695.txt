Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. Enable continuous profiling on TiDB
2. Create 5k connections to TiDB
3. Send queries of about 1k QPS
4. Watch the P999 duration of queries

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No jitter

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Some duration jitters, including compiling duration, get TSO duration, etc.
P999 sometimes up to 100ms or above.
The jitter happens one time every minute, which matches the frequency of continuous profiling.
