### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Create table `t1` and insert into 10000000 rows data.
2. Execute following SQLs in client-A and client-B at same time:

```sql
select count(*),sum(a+b),sum(b+d),sum(c+d*2), sum(d*2+a*b), avg(a*b*d), avg(b*c), avg(c*d),avg(a*b*d), avg(2*b*c), avg(3*c*d), sum(a*b*c), sum(b*d) from t1;
```

```sql
select count(*) from t1 as t0 join t1 as t1 on t0.a != t1.a;
```

3. enable TopSQL during the upper SQL execution:

```sql
set @@global.tidb_enable_top_sql=1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```sql
