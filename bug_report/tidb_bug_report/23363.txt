Title: Risk of breaking consistency when changing column from null to not null
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Initial table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (id INT PRIMARY KEY, v INT);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 0);
```
Change the value to `NULL` and change the value to not null concurrently.

```sql
-- Session 1
BEGIN;

-- Session 2 (Concurrently)
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY COLUMN v INT NOT NULL;

-- Session 1 (Concurrently)
UPDATE t SET v = NULL WHERE ID = 0;
COMMIT;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Either the DDL or the transaction fails.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

I think it is possible that both the DDL and the transaction succeed. Because under async commit, there is no check after the not null flag is added.

Then, the table contains NULL, but the column schema is NOT NULL.

I'm still trying to create a test case that can reproduce it.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

5.0/nightly
