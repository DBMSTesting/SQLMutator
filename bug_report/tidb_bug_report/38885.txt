### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Consider that two adding index jobs, id=1 and id=2.
The job id=2 added to the job table and execute first, and the job id=1 added to the job table.
According to the SQL `select job_meta, processing from mysql.tidb_ddl_job where job_id in (select min(job_id) from mysql.tidb_ddl_job group by schema_ids, table_ids) and %s reorg %s order by processing desc, job_id`.
DDL dispacter would choose the job id=1. But if found that the job id=2 on the same table is processing. Which causes the dead lock. 


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
No deadlock.
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
6.2~master
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
