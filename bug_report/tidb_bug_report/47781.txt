Title: local backend: worker error is eaten on some case
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

suppose when execute job we return `the remaining storage capacity of TiKV(%s) is less than 10%%`, the context will be cancelled
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/d74298c132a1ffc1e9bc56324211648da764fbd0/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1675-L1679

then here we noticed that context cancelled and return `context cancelled` error(might be wrapped inside other error, such as `rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled: [BR:PD:ErrPDBatchScanRegion]batch scan region"` during page scan regions)
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/d74298c132a1ffc1e9bc56324211648da764fbd0/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1683
and in here, we record this `context cancelled` err, not the err that causes context cancel is eaten
