Title: Incorrect query result may caused by REGEXP_LIKE function
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 BOOL);
REPLACE INTO t0(c0) VALUES (false), (true);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT (REGEXP_LIKE(t0.c0, t0.c0)) FROM t0 WHERE t0.c0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING 1;


SELECT t0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE (SUBTIME('2001-11-28 06', '252 10') OR ('' IS NOT NULL));
SELECT t0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE (SUBTIME('2001-11-28 06', '252 10') OR ('' IS NOT NULL)) AND v0.c0;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
mysql> select * from v0;
+------+
| c0   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

Since v0 is 1, the condition of sql2 `AND v0.c0` evaluated to be True, sql1 and sql2 should have the same result

```
SELECT t0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE (SUBTIME('2001-11-28 06', '252 10') OR ('' IS NOT NULL)); --sql1 

SELECT t0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE (SUBTIME('2001-11-28 06', '252 10') OR ('' IS NOT NULL)) AND v0.c0; --sql2
```


### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
sql1 and sql2 return different result

```
mysql> SELECT t0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE (SUBTIME('2001-11-28 06', '252 10') OR ('' IS NOT NULL));
+------+
| c0   |
+------+
|    0 |
|    1 |
+------+
2 rows in set, 3 warnings (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT t0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE (SUBTIME('2001-11-28 06', '252 10') OR ('' IS NOT NULL)) AND v0.c0;
+------+
| c0   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    1 |
+------+
2 rows in set, 3 warnings (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

TiDB-v7.6.0
