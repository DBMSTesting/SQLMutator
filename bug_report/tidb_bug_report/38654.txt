Title: Unexpected Results by RIGHT JOIN
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);

SELECT * FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0; -- {NULL|1}
SELECT ((NOT ('i'))AND(t0.c0)) IS NULL FROM  t0 RIGHT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0; -- {1}
SELECT * FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0 WHERE ((NOT ('i'))AND(t0.c0)) IS NULL; -- empty set
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
`SELECT * FROM t0 RIGHT JOIN t1 ON t0.c0;` returns non-empty result and ` ((NOT ('i'))AND(t0.c0)) IS NULL` is evaluated to `true` in the second SELECT, but the third `SELECT` returns empty result.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
