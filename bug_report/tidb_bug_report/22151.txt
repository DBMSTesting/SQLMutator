Title: release 4.0 doesn't support SQL binding on SQLs with window function
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
create table t (a int);
create binding for SELECT row_number() over () from t using select /*+ MEMORY_QUOTA(1024 MB) */ row_number() over () from t;
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
and successfully bind.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
ERROR 1105 (HY000): line 1 column 55 near "() from t"
```

root cause is that `EnableWindowFunc` is not set in `(br *BindRecord) prepareHints`.

This problem is not on master because `EnableWindowFunc` is turned on by default in https://github.com/pingcap/parser/pull/986 for the master branch.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

all v4.0.x
