Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[Dashboard]-wrong memory usage info for TiFlash
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#91

---

### 1. What did you do?

- deploy a cluster on Aliyun with tiup
- visit PD's dashboard -- cluster info -- hosts

### 2. What did you expect to see?

TiFlash's memory usage is correct

### 3. What did you see instead?

TiFlash's memory usage is incorrect

I have another cluster which deployed on Tencent Cloud, the TiFlash node on that also shows a memory usage at `96.2%`, but actually the node only has a memory usage at `65%`

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
