Title: some bugs about `MergePartTopN2GlobalTopN`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

When we test the accuracy of global stats， we found that TiDB entered an endless loop. Here is the debug stack

Through this, we found a bug in the function `func (hg *Histogram) RemoveVals(valCntPairs []TopNMeta)`： If the `valCntPairs` has a value which is less than lower bound of hg.buckets[0], it will enter an endless loop.

Then we try to write a test case to trigger this bug. But in the process, we found two bugs in `MergePartTopN2GlobalTopN`:

1. It uses incorrect encode value to build `TopNMeta` struct.
2. `func (hg *Histogram) RemoveVals(valCntPairs []TopNMeta)` needs `valCntPairs` in ascending order， but `MergePartTopN2GlobalTopN` doesn't guarantee this assumption.

Here is another issue about `analyze version`.
For version1, histograms contain `topn` values, but version2 histograms do not.
Considering that different versions have greater complexity, and if `topn` is not included in the histogram, the stats will be more accurate. For global stats, we will uniformly remove the `topn` value in the histogram.

It is difficult to provide integration test scenarios for these issues, I will provide unit tests in a later PR.
