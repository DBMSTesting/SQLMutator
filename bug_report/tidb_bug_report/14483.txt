Title: The result of Merge Join with hint is wrong when using DESC
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
```
create table t (a int, b int);
create index index_a on t(a);
create index index_b on t(b);
insert into t values (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3);
select /*+ TIDB_SMJ(t1, t2) */ t1.a from t t1, t t2 where t1.a = t2.b order by t1.a desc;
```
(The result is correct when not using DESC)
