Title: Don't  update next Key in cache lead to update the wrong next key to storage when modifying column interrupted
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
create table t1 (c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, index idx(c2), index idx1(c1, c2));
alter table t1 change c2 c2 mediumint;
admin check table t1;
```
When executing modify column statement in the write-reorg state(handling backfill of the first index), encounter a retried error like `TxnRetryableError` or `ErrNotOwner`(This error is currently being handled incorrectly).

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Execute successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Data indexes are inconsistent.

At present, because `ErrNotOwner` does not have this problem, `TxnRetryableError` is difficult to appear (generally a high success rate, in addition, you can retry 10 times). So I set it to `[severity/moderate]`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
