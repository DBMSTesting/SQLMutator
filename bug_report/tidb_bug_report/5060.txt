Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
```

SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 on (t2.a < all (SELECT 1));
```
2. What did you expect to see?

panic

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V`)?

I found the cause of this panic, in `plan/logical_plan_builder.go:290`, the expression rewriter rewrite the On condition to an `aux_col`, and returned a Projection, but the Projection is ignored, we still use the join plan to attach On condition, then later the `aux_col` can not be resolved in the join plan.
