Title: Lightning: Performance Regression on 6.2.0 Compared with 5.3.3 on Parquet Data Source with Strings
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Import a moderate data set into different versions of Lightning: 1) 6.2.0; 2) 5.3.3
The reproduce conditions: 
* The data format of the source is parquet
* The data set to import contains some string columns
* The table schema should set the encoding to 'binary'

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required) 
* It takes longer time to finish the import on 6.2.0 than in 5.3.3 
* From the log, we can see the encode KV time is much longer in 6.2.0, the import KV time is roughly the same as in 5.3.3

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The import time on newer version of Lightning should be roughly the same as the older version

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
6.2.0
