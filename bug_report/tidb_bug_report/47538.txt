Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/937feda20e458ef5468a291f050f0258c653d483/util/chunk/row_container.go#L631-L651

In L648, it use `go a.c.sortAndSpillToDisk() ` to start a spill without setting recover function, and in `sortAndSpillToDisk()`

It will first sort the data, then spill it to disk, `SpillToDisk()` has set recover function, but `Sort()` does not set recover function, so if error happens during `Sort()`, TiDB will crash.
