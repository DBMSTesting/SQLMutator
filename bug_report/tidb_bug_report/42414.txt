Title: The metric Transaction - Fair Locking Usage shows nothing due to incorrect metric name
Description:
## Bug Report

The metric *Fair Locking Usage* in Transaction section in TiDB's grafana dashboard shows no data.

The reason is that the metric queries `tidb_session_transaction_fair_locking_usage`, however in TiDB's code it's mistakenly written as `tidb_server_transaction_fair_locking_usage`.
