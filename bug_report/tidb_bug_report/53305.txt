Title: user password options not compatible with MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

To migrate from MySQL 8.x to TiDB one might copy user accounts by running `SHOW CREATE USER ...` on MySQL and executing the result on TiDB. However this fails due to a mismatch in what MySQL produces and what TiDB accepts.

More info:
- #7968 (See the entry for 8.0.13)
- https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html#create-user-password-management
- https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=11544
- https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/mysql-8-0-13-change-current-password-policy/

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

On MySQL 8.0.37
```sql
CREATE USER 'test1'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'secret';
SHOW CREATE USER 'test1'@'%';
```

Then on TiDB execute what MySQL produced:
```sql
CREATE USER `test1`@`%` IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' AS '*14E65567ABDB5135D0CFD9A70B3032C179A49EE7' REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 266 near "REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT" 
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```
mysql> SELECT TIDB_VERSION()\G
