Title: Use mydumper to back up a database containing many tables, very slow
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

A：The number of tables in the backup target database is very large. There are more than 70,000 tables. The total amount of data is 1.2T from the monitoring. When I use mydumper for backup, I backed up 8 hours and backed up 40,000 tables. The amount of data backed up is only 20g. (not backed up)

I want to ask: 
1）Why is it so slow when backing up many tables? What did mydumper do during this period?

2）Backing up a database with a particularly large number of database tables, is there any suggestion to speed up database backups for multiple tables?

B： I also encountered problems with tidb oom. At present, the version of tidb is 2.1.4. When I back up a database with a large amount of data, the situation of tidb oom will appear. Check the official website's issue, explaining the reason for the tidb version. When backing up, load all the data into the memory, which causes the tidb oom. The version after tidb2.1.13 fixes this.

2. What did you expect to see?

When the database is backed up with a lot of tables, the speed will be very fast.


3. What did you see instead?

Very slow when backing up a database with a large number of tables


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

tidb version 2.1.4
