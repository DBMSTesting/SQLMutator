Title: 'show create table'  gets snapshot in repeatable read isolation level
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

initial schema:

```
create table table0 (a int);
```

create 2 sessions and execute queries below:

```
session1 > begin;
session1 > show create table table0;
session2 > insert into table0 values(1);
session1 > select * from table0;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The last select return:
```
+------+
| a    |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
as MySQL5.7 acts.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The last select return `Empty set (0.01 sec)`. This means that TiDB gets snapshot when execute `show create table`. It's not compatible with MySQL5.7.

Another evidence is that, when we change the operation session2 executes into a ddl in the case above. For example, change `insert into table0 values(1);` into `alter table table0 add column (c int);`. TiDB will block this ddl, while MySQL will not.

I'm not sure if it's a bug, since the snapshot behavior of TiDB is not completely the same with MySQL. Though it's saied that `show create table` is completely compatible with MySQL.
