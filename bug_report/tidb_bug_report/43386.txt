Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. During dr-autosync cluster running in sync_recover mode, shutdown the primary DC, switch to backup DC;
2. Get min-resolved-ts as follows:
```
tiup ctl:v6.5.1 pd -u http://pd3-peer.e2e-oltp-tiup-dr-auto-sync-3r-tps-1666585-1-567:2379/ min-resolved-ts
\"min_resolved_ts\": 440986319057584310
```
4. Parser the ts to timestamp
```
  MySQL [(none)]> SELECT TIDB_PARSE_TSO(440986334746902656);
  +------------------------------------+
  | TIDB_PARSE_TSO(440986334746902656) |
  +------------------------------------+
  | 2023-04-23 13:56:05.337000         |
  +------------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```
5. flashback the cluster to min-resolved-ts
```
MySQL [(none)]> FLASHBACK CLUSTER TO TIMESTAMP '2023-04-23 13:56:05.337000';
ERROR 1105 (HY000): cannot set flashback timestamp after min-resolved-ts(2023-04-23 13:46:09.837 +0800 CST)
