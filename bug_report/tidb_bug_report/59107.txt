Title: Statistics' async load loads more items than current sync load
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Before https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/56813, take the following SQL as an example:
```
table t(a int, b int, cint, index idx(a, b));
select * from t where a > 1;
```
Both sync load and async load will load `a`'s full stats, `idx`'s full stats, and the NDV/NullCount info of columns `b` and `c`.

After https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/56813, sync load will not load the stats of `b` and `c` anymore. But we forget to modify the async load.
So as a result, `b` and `c`'s NDV/NullCount will be loaded finally.
It's a mistake and we should fix it.
