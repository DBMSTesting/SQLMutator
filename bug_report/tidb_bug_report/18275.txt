Description:
## Description
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. Prepare a partition table(naming t0), add tiflash replica and wait till its available flag is true.
2. Add a new partition(naming p1).
3. For some reason, PD doesn't add tiflash peer for region(s) of the p1 fast enough.
4. If a query involves the region(s) of p1, it will try to access tiflash peer because the table "t0 is available". But it can not find tiflash peer for that some region.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
For partition table, TiDB should block `add partition` statement till the TiFlash replica of new partition is ready.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Some queries which involve new partition will be blocked or unavailable for a while.

### 4. Affected version (Required)

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->
v3.1, v4.0

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

<!-- should be filled by the investigator before it's closed -->
