Title: plan: fix the bug that we got wrong range when the condition involved in expression.
Description:
If we have found some in expression during calculating range, we should not consider any more column. Because for condition a in (1,3) and b > 5, we should calculate the range like (1 5,2 -inf) and (3 5,4 -inf) when the a is an integer. But when a is a string or float, we can never get a proper range.
So temporarily we don't consider this case.
