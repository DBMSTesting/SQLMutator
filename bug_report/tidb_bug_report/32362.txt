Title: Cost model for normal index scan is different from index scan for a index join
Description:
## Enhancement
The cost formula of a normal index scan (in `(*DataSource).getOriginalPhysicalIndexScan()`) contains `nRanges * seekFactor`, but the formula of an index scan for an index join (in `(*LogicalJoin).constructInnerIndexScanTask()`) doesn't contain this part.
