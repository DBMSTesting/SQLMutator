Title: sem does not support dynamic privilege RESTRICTED_CONNECTION_ADMIN
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
mysql> GRANT RESTRICTED_CONNECTION_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'cloudAdmin'@'%';
ERROR 3929 (HY000): Dynamic privilege 'RESTRICTED_CONNECTION_ADMIN' is not registered with the server.
```

This was in the original SEM proposal. I believe it may have inadvertently been merged with RESTRICTED_USER_ADMIN.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No error.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Error

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
