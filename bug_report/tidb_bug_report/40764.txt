Title: Column defaults in ComFieldList response violate protocol
Description:
## Bug Report

The `mysql.ComFieldList` returns default values for columns. However this isn't fully implemented in TiDB, so it won't send the actual defaults and it also seems to violate the protocol.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Send a field list query, e.g. by connecting without database and running `use test` in the MySQL Client.
Dump and inspect traffic with Wireshark

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Proper column defaults

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Too many zeros being written.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```
$ ./bin/tidb-server -V
