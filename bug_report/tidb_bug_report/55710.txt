Title: Unstable double results returned by sum agg when using default value of tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

create table test(a double);
insert into test values(12345678.12345678);
insert into test select a from test; -- repeat multiple times
split table test between (1) and (16384) regions 10;
split table test between (1) and (16384) regions 11; -- split table unevenly
select sum(a) from test;

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The same result is returned.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The results are unstable, like this:
```
+--------------------+
| sum(a)             |
+--------------------+
| 202271590374.71768 |
+--------------------+
+-------------------+
| sum(a)            |
+-------------------+
| 202271590374.7177 |
+-------------------+
+--------------------+
| sum(a)             |
+--------------------+
| 202271590374.71774 |
+--------------------+
```

If tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency is set to 1, then get the stable and same result:
```
+-------------------+
| sum(a)            |
+-------------------+
| 202271590374.7177 |
+-------------------+
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v4.0 and above
