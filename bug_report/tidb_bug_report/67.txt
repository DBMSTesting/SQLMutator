Title: add separator for index key prefix and index value
Description:
now the index prefix is `fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s", indexPrefix, indexName)`, it is not enough as the index key prefix. 

the index key format: prefix + codec(value)

assume we have two indices naming c1 and c, the index c1 may be `123_c1{value}`, but the index c may be `123_c{value}`, as you see, if the value contain 1 in index c, we may have same prefix for index c1, and we will get the wrong data using index c1. 

the index key format may be `indexPrefix_indexName\xff\xff`, why `\xff\xff`? We will guarantee that any codec value is less than `\xff\xff`.
