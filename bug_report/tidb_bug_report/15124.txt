Title: Inconsistent behavior of store `mocktikv` and `tikv`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
if I use default store in tidb (mocktikv), I will get ["dump failed"] [error="err = Error 1105: can not get 'tikv_gc_safe_point'\

2. What did you expect to see?
`mocktikv` and `tikv` keep consistent behavior, because `dumpling` and `mydumper` doesn't which `store` used by tidb
