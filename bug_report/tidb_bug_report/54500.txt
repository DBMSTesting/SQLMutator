Title: Unrelated DDL change cause cache miss and reload in infoschema v2
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

As the title says, that kind of behavior is not expected. 

For example, if I have a table t1
I do some unrelated DDL operations
Visiting t1 should still always hit cache



### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)


create table t1 (id int);
select * from t1;   // hit infoschema cache
// evit the schema cache of t1
create table t2 (id int);
select * from t1; 
select * from t1;   //  hit infoschema cache because DDL is on t2, unrelated to t1
create table t3 (id int);
select * from t1;   // hit infoschema cache because DDL is on t3, unrelated to t1
create table t4 (id int);
select * from t1;;  // hit infoschema cache because DDL is on t4, unrelated to t1



### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

After the original t1 cache  been evicted, the following DDL operation would cause schema cache miss everytime.


### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
