Title: Unexpected insert error happened when the execution plan contains index join
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
create table t(a varchar(1), index idx(a));
create table t1(a varchar(5), index idx(a));
insert into t values('a'), ('b');
insert into t1 values('a'), ('bbbbb');
update /*+ INL_JOIN(t) */ t, t1 set t.a='a' where t.a=t1.a;
update /*+ INL_HASH_JOIN(t) */ t, t1 set t.a='a' where t.a=t1.a;
update /*+ INL_MERGE_JOIN(t) */ t, t1 set t.a='a' where t.a=t1.a;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The update executed successfully and one row is affected(though actually no changes happened).

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Error thrown. `Data Too Long, field len 1, data len 5`

A related behavior. If you run `select /*+ HASH_JOIN(t) */ * from t, t1 where t.a=t1.a;` and `select /*+ INL_JOIN(t) */ * from t, t1 where t.a=t1.a;`. You will see that the there's no warning returned from hash join but some warnings returned from index join.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Current master and 4.0.8

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
