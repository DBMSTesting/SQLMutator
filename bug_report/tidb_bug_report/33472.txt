Title: innodb_lock_wait_timeout MaxValue > max-txn-ttl
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Discovered in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/33361

The max for the amount of time locks can be held is 1hr (3600000 ms). But the max that pessimistic lock wait timeout can be is 34 years. These aren't quite the same thing, but it makes sense to unify the two such that you can only wait up to 1hr for a pessimistic lock.

Otherwise there are weird scenarios where you are waiting on a lock for >1hr, but your existing locks expire while waiting.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Same values (or similar range)

So I propose we set `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` max value to 3600.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
