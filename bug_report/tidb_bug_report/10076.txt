Title: Auto-retry on PD crash can *also* cause lost updates, read skew
Description:
As noted in #10075, TiDB loses updates by default thanks to an auto-retry mechanism. The [documentation](https://www.pingcap.com/docs/sql/transaction-isolation/) says you can disable this mechanism by setting `@@global.tidb_disable_txn_auto_retry = 1;`. This is not entirely correct. There is a *second* automatic transaction retry mechanism, which comes into play when the connection to PD is lost--for example, if PD crashes. This retry mechanism can *also* cause lost updates.

I suggest disabling this retry mechanism by default as well, and, going forward, modify it to only retry transactions which can be safely re-applied.

In addition, setting `tidb_disable_txn_auto_retry` should disable *all* automatic retry mechanisms.

1. What did you do?

With Jepsen 8c4f1101510b382266a3b8d3fdaa7adfc60d9d9a, run

```
lein run test --time-limit 120 --concurrency 2n -w bank --nemesis kill-pd
```

2. What did you expect to see?

The total of all accounts should be constant.

3. What did you see instead?

Shortly after the recovery from a PD crash affecting a majority of PD nodes, account balances can briefly fluctuate. This anomaly is not a transient read phenomenon; logical state is corrupted. We believe this represents another case of lost updates. http://jepsen.io.s3.amazonaws.com/analyses/tidb-2.1.7/20190408T132351-pd-auto-retry.zip

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
