Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

set network partition between tikv leader and tikv follower/tiflash, but keep accessible between some tidb and follower/tiflash

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

follower/learner read sql can be handle be retry other accessible and catch up follower or tiflash

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

infinite retry and report kv unavaliable error

### 4. Affected version (Required)

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->
4.0.0.rc2

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

<!-- should be filled by the investigator before it's closed -->

in #16933 we introduce a mechanism that rechecks store liveness when sending requests failed, it works well for leader based requests.

but for follower or learner requests, this may introduce infinitely retry.

when there is a network partition between the leader and followers/leaners, but accessible between TiDB-Server and followers and leaners, followers and learner will return timeout error when they can not catch up with leader due to network partition, but rechecks store liveness still can success, but it's better to retry other peers immediately in this situation.
