Title: Panic triggered at executor.(*executorBuilder).buildShuffle (executor/builder.go:4880)
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

**Setup the database:**

```
CREATE TABLE t0 (vkey int, c0 double);
CREATE TABLE t3 (pkey int);
```

**Testcase**
```
WITH
cte_4 AS (select
    DENSE_RANK() over (partition by ref_64.c0) as c0
  from
    ((
      (
        (t3 as ref_62 cross join t3 as ref_63)
        left join
        (t0 as ref_64 cross join t0 as ref_65)
        on (ref_63.pkey = ref_64.vkey )
      )
      cross join (select
                 null as c0,
                 null as c1
            from
              t0 as ref_66
            ) as subq_4
     )
     cross join t0 as ref_67
    )
)
select
    FIRST_VALUE(subq_5.c2) over (partition by subq_5.c1) as c4
  from
    (select distinct
          1 as c1,
          avg(-93.97) as c2
        from
          cte_4 as ref_78
        group by ref_78.c0 ) as subq_5;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No panic.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR 1105 (HY000): runtime error: makeslice: len out of range
```
