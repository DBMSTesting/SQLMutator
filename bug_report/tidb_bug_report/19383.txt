Title: SELECT LOCK IN SHARE MODE is unsafe
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

See: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/pessimistic-transaction#difference-with-mysql-innodb

Under (2) it says that `SELECT LOCK IN SHARE MODE` is a noop. This seems unsafe, at least by default.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I would like to see it protected by the feature `tidb_enable_noop_functions`. This will allow users to explicitly turn it on, if they require syntax support but are fine with a noop.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The statement executes without errors.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

All versions.
