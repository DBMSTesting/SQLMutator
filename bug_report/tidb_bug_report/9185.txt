Title: Error 1105: Out Of Memory Quota!
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

When the amount of data in the lookup table is large, it is found that the memory usage threshold of the given SQL has not been reached, and the disconnection occurs, and an error is reported: Error: [Error 1105: Out Of Memory Quota!.

the size of Memory usage threshold for the entire SQL  is 32 << 30，In the test, the memory size only reached 11.6G。

- the query 

```
SELECT  a.resxxxe_id, a.host_id,a.area_id,a.vcpu, a.memory, a.timemachine_feature, a.deleted, a.create_time, a.update_time,
                        b.product_type as ubXXXt_type,b.item_type as ubiXXXype,b.company_id as ubiXXXX_id,b.project_id as ubXXXXXct_id,
                        b.area_id as ubXXXXXd,b.multiple as ubill_multiple,b.deleted_mark as ubiXXXXXXark,b.non_exist_mark as ubilXXXXXt_mark,
                        b.deleted_time as ubill_deleted_time,b.create_time as ubill_create_time,b.update_time as ubill_update_time,
                        IFNULL(e.disks_ixxxrmation,'[]') as disk_inxxxation,
                        IFNULL(c.nics_information,'[]') as nic_infoXXXon,
                        IFNULL(d.images_information,'{}') as imaXXXXXrmation
        FROM t_uhost_resource a
        RIGHT JOIN t_B b ON b.resource_id=a.resource_id
        LEFT JOIN t_uhost_XXX e ON e.resource_id=a.resource_id
        LEFT JOIN t_uhost_XXX c ON c.resource_id=a.resource_id
        LEFT JOIN t_uimaXXXX d ON d.resource_id=a.resource_id
        WHERE a.resource_id IN (SELECT resource_id FROM t_A) AND a.resource_id NOT IN (SELECT  resource_id FROM t_C)
        ORDER BY a.resource_id ASC
        LIMIT 0,100000
        ] Args [[]] Error:[Error 1105: Out Of Memory Quota!
```

t_A has more than 4 million data，t_B has more than 40 million data，t_A has more than 70 million data

- the memory when error happend

when error happend the size of memory is 11.63, Less than the size limit of a single container: 20G，Memory usage threshold less than the entire SQL: 32 << 30 （byte）

- 3 log

1. What did you expect to see?

When the memory consumed by the instance is less than the memory usage threshold of the entire SQL, the error "Error 1105: Out Of Memory Quota!" will not occur, and the error will be reported if the threshold is exceeded.

1. What did you see instead?

The error "Error 1105: Out Of Memory Quota!" occurred when the memory consumed by the instance was less than the memory usage threshold for the entire SQL.
