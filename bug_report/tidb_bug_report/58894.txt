Title: json float in scientific format is different with MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('[1E27]', '$')
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
[1e27]
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
[1e+27]
```

In `util.AppendFormatFloat`, TiDB provides a function to format a float in MySQL  compatible way. However, the json value doesn't use this function (because they actually have a little logic difference). We'd better to align the behavior between them.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
