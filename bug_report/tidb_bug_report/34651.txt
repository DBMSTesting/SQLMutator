## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
at sometimes. we may get the wrong store info from pd.
```
"store": {
        "id": 4,
        "address": "[172.16.6.46:41160](http://172.16.6.46:41160/)",
        "version": "6.0.0-alpha",
        "status_address": "[0.0.0.0:41180](http://0.0.0.0:41180/)",
        ...
}
```
the address and status_address's hostname are not same. we should use the address as host.
