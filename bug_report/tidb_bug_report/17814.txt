Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-Incorrect result when fetching from a view
Description:
## Description
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#8

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0, c1) AS SELECT t0.c0, 1 FROM t0;
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (0);
SELECT v0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE v0.c1; -- expected: {0}, actual: {}
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` does not fetch any rows:
```

mysql> SELECT v0.c0 FROM v0, t0 WHERE v0.c1; -- expected: {0}, actual: {}

```

Interestingly, the query work as expected when fetching all columns, and not only `v0.c0`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM v0, t0 WHERE v0.c1; -- {0|1|0}
```
I checked with MySQL 8.0.19, which computes the result I would expect:

Environment:

I propose P0 as a bug level, since it matches the following description: `wrong results returned by the query, and inconsistent results returned by the SQL output.`
