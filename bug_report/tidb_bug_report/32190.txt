Title: PD rules are not removed when `alter table set tiflash replica 0`

## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
ref https://github.com/pingcap/tics/issues/3982

When removing a TiFlash replica, we need to delete its pd rule. Though we can delete a rule by setting count=0 through pd-ctl, we can't do that by Pd's HTTP API. It will cause some rules that will not be gc-ed.

This bug won't affect any previous version.
