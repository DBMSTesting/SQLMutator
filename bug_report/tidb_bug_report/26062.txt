> INFORMATION_SCHEMA and Privileges
> For most INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables, each MySQL user has the right to access them, but can see only the rows in the tables that correspond to objects for which the user has the proper access privileges. In some cases (for example, the ROUTINE_DEFINITION column in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROUTINES table), users who have insufficient privileges see NULL. Some tables have different privilege requirements; for these, the requirements are mentioned in the applicable table descriptions. For example, InnoDB tables (tables with names that begin with INNODB_) require the PROCESS privilege.
>
> The same privileges apply to selecting information from INFORMATION_SCHEMA and viewing the same information through SHOW statements. In either case, you must have some privilege on an object to see information about it.
