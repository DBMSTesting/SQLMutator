Title: Can't read from some information_schema tables when cascades planner is enabled
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

Not a big deal, but wanted to file a bug so you can track it:

```
mysql> set tidb_enable_cascades_planner = 1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from information_schema.slow_query;
ERROR 1815 (HY000): Internal : Can't find a proper physical plan for this query
```

This is also the case for information_schema.processlist. cluster_processlist and cluster_slow_query return zero results which is worse / inconsistent.

2. What did you expect to see?

Query should succeed.

3. What did you see instead?

Error or no results.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
