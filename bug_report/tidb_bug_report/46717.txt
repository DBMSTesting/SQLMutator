Title: Array field should be passed to the `columnInfo`
Description:
The following sql will fail:

```
create table t (pk varchar(4) primary key clustered, j json, str varchar(255), value int, key idx((cast(j as char(100) array)), str));
insert into t values ("1", '["a"]', 'b', 1);
select * from t use index(idx) where "a" member of (j);
```

Because tikv thinks it's a normal column and try to restore the data. However, the restore data doesn't exist in the value because tidb think it's a json and don't need to restore.

A better way to fix this is to set the collation to `binary`. See https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/46691. This issue should also be  fixed for backward compatibility (for existing data / indexes).
