Title: Multiple domains may appear for one store under extreme cases
Description:
## Bug Report

#33737 introduced rwmutex for domap. But wlock part did not check the condition again. Thus multiple domains of one store may appear under heavy concurrent invokes of domap.

Minor issue since it is almost unreproduceable for users. Reported by @wjhuang2016 .
