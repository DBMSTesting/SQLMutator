Title: MinSafeTS might be set to MaxUint64 permanently
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```bash
tiup playground v7.1.1 --db 1 --kv 1 --pd 1 --tiflash 0
```

and then find the `updateMinSafeTS` in client-go is `MaxUint64`, which will make `MinSafeTS` keep `MaxUint64` permanently. related https://github.com/tikv/client-go/issues/991

```bash
mysql> SELECT TIDB_PARSE_TSO(18446744073709551615);
+--------------------------------------+
| TIDB_PARSE_TSO(18446744073709551615) |
+--------------------------------------+
| NULL                                 |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
high possibility to reproduce in `tiup playground` with one tikv. 
Because the cluster needs to meet: cluster started quickly before tikv's `min-safe-ts` finish initializing. This situation is highly possible happening in `tiup playground` because tidb can quickly start here.
