### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Both `status` and `SELECT VERSION()` to report the same version.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

See screenshot

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
v7.5.0


Some ways to fix this:

- Update `github.com/pingcap/tidb/parser` (but then using this with older versions will have a similar issue)
- Connect to one of the backend servers to get a version
  - Use something like `$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:10080/status |jq .version`
  - Maybe the first server? Maybe a random server? Maybe all of them and then use the highest or lowest?
- Store this in PD/etcd and have TiDB or PD set this.
