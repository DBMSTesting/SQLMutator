Title: distsql: All data may be stored in memory(potential OOM) if kvReq.KeepOrder is true with a slow client
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

Run `select * from sbtest1 order by pk` with a client that does not receive data from its connection.
After a while, tidb-server holds all data from sbtest1 into its memory.

When kvReq.KeepOrder is true, each copTask has its own channel so that each of them will be filled by copIteratorWorker. 

2. What did you expect to see?



3. What did you see instead?



4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
