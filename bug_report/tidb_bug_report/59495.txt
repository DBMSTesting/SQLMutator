Title: performance is not expected for prefetch reader
Description:
In current code we don't fully make use of the prefetch buffer. There's a background goroutine (spawned in line 48) that uses the prefetch buffer to read data from reader (line 57)

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b7e97690b9feb019ab0bec9ea6814af432ae948d/pkg/util/prefetch/reader.go#L48-L63

However if the reader only return partial data (like it's a socket and OS chooses to return only few bytes, naming `N`) this reading action is finished and the loop is waiting on sending to channel (line 62). If the caller of "prefetch reader" doesn't consume the channel quickly, we are wasting a large proportion of the prefetch buffer which is `buf[N:]` because they are not filled. We should let the background goroutine use `io.ReadFull` to fully use the prefetch buffer.
