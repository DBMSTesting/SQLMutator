Title: TTL `getSession` function may return unexpected result
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

The function `getSession` returns a session and an error. It's expected to return either `session` or an `error`. However, it's possible that both of them are `nil`, because the `Close()` function may overwrite the `err` return value.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

At least one of `session` and `err` are not `nil`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Both of them are `nil` if the session is error.
