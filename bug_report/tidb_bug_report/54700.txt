Title: Default value as an expression really only supports default value as function
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

From [the MySQL manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-type-defaults.html) there is an example that uses a literal default specified as an expression:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t2 (b BLOB DEFAULT ('abc'));
```

In my actual application, I have a similar example where the literal is `'0'`. If you test in MySQL you can also use expressions like `DEFAULT(NOW()+2)`, but these are also parse errors in TiDB.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (b BLOB DEFAULT ('abc'));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> SELECT version();
+-----------+
| version() |
+-----------+
| 8.0.32    |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (b BLOB DEFAULT ('abc'));
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 38 near "'abc'))"
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```
mysql> SELECT tidb_version()\G
