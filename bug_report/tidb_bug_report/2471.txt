Title: executor: fix bug of union type converting.
Description:
fix #2317 
Type inferer sometimes behaves differently from `CoerceArithmetic`. 
e.g. inferer thinks date + int would be mysql.LongLong but CoerceArithmetic will convert it to datum.KindDecimal.
Considering we are refactoring type inferer, I don't hope to make type inferer more complex. So I let every union branch do converting.
