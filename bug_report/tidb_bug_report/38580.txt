Title: Max execution time mechanism  skip checking DDL jobs
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Create table and load lots of data; set max_execution_time to a short time; create an index which may cost more than 30 seconds
`
create table t1 (...);
set global max_execution_time = 30000;
create index idx_1 on t1 (col1);
`

Then these error logs will continue to be output until the end of index creation. It's too confusing and misunderstanding.
