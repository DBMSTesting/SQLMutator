Title: `InitLogger` before `CreateMockStore` in tests to avoid data race
Description:
## Bug Report

In tests related to slow log, we would use `InitLogger` to create a separate slow log file.

In `CreateMockStore`, it will run queries in a separate goroutine and access the slow query logger. The `InitLogger` would also modify the slow query logger.

So there might be a data race if we first `CreateMockStore` and then `InitLogger`.
