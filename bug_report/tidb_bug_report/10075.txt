Title: Default auto-retry mechanism causes TiDB to lose updates by default
Description:
The auto-retry mechanism, enabled by default in TiDB 2.1.7, retries transaction failures by blindly re-applying writes from the failed transaction in a fresh transaction. This  effectively bypasses the conflict detection required by snapshot isolation: when a conflict is encountered, transactions *should* abort, but instead, they can go on to commit their conflicting writes regardless of conflicts. The result is lost updates.

There are certain classes of transactions which *can* be safely retried--for instance, blind writes, in-place updates, and transactions in which no client-visible reads occur before a write. However, TiDB assumes *all* transactions can be safely retried, which violates TiDB's claim of snapshot isolation.

I suggest disabling the retry mechanism by default.

1. What did you do?

With Jepsen d003233c0e7e9f6d9f841647f661a868cd0a222a, run 

```
lein run test --time-limit 60 --concurrency 2n -w bank --auto-retry
```

This test transfers money between simulated bank accounts; under snapshot isolation, the total of all accounts should remain constant. However, with automatic retries, under normal operating conditions without failures, the total balance drifts over time: transactions observe values in transaction T1, and, thanks to retries, commit new values based on those from T1 in a fresh transaction T2.

2. What did you expect to see?

The total of all accounts should be constant.

3. What did you see instead?

The total of all accounts fluctuates over time: http://jepsen.io.s3.amazonaws.com/analyses/tidb-2.1.7/20190408T132351-auto-retry.zip.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
