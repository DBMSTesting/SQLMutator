## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
mysql> set tidb_enable_table_partition=on;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> create table t (i int) partition by range columns (i) (partition p0 values less than (10));                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> insert into t values (1),(2),(3),(4);

mysql> create table test2.t like test.t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

mysql> select * from test2.t;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
+------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

2. What did you expect to see?

The result of ` select * from test2.t;` should be empty.

3. What did you see instead?

It seems that `create table like` shadow copy the partition info from the original table.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
