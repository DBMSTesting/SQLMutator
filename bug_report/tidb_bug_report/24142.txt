Title: REVOKE / GRANT visitInfo is incorrect on global grants
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

From manual inspection of the code, when GRANT is on *.* the `visitInfo` collected the `dbName`  even if it is not applicable:

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

It should be `if dbName == "" && stmt.Level.Level != ast.GrantLevelGlobal {`. There are also no tests on `visitInfo` for `GrantLevelGlobal`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
if dbName == "" {
	dbName = sctx.GetSessionVars().CurrentDB
}
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master
