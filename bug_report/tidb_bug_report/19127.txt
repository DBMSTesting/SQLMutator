Title: Affected rows are incorrect when updating a table with partitions
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t (c_int int, c_str varchar(40), primary key (c_int, c_str) ) partition by hash (c_int) partitions 4;
insert into t values (9, 'angry williams'), (10, 'thirsty hugle');
update t set c_int = c_int + 10, c_str = 'adoring stonebraker' where c_int in (10, 9);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Only 2 rows get affected.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql> update t set c_int = c_int + 10, c_str = 'adoring stonebraker' where c_int in (10, 9);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.06 sec)
Rows matched: 2  Changed: 2  Warnings: 0
```
It seems the data is correct after update, only affected-rows in the response is wrong.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
master @ 8978773f5e3d43a100550e6babea9904a99e5938
