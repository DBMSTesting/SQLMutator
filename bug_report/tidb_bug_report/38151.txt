Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Write a simple program: 
* Construct two TOML configs: one with table filter set, the other without table filters.
* Construct a Lightning config using the TOML data with table filter.
* Construct a Lightning config again using the TOML data without the table filter.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Both generated Lightning config should be OK.  The second Lightning config should use the default table filter.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
In the second Lightning config, the table filter is not the default table filters.  It contains the filter item in the previous Lightning config.
