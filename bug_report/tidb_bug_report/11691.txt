Title: trace format='json' puts illegal linebreaks into json output
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

`trace format='json' select * from information_schema.columns union select * from information_schema.columns`

2. What did you expect to see?

This should output a valid JSON document.

3. What did you see instead?

The output is a JSON document split apart into 4 rows of an SQL resultset, with linebreaks in places that cause the JSON output to be malformed.

The JSON document should instead be returned as a single line, probably as type LONG_BLOB.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
