Title: GET_LOCK() does not take the possibility of losing pessimistic locks into consideration
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

session 1 get_lock().
Wait for 10 minutes. (The inner pessimistic lock somehow gets lost.)
session 2 tries to get_lock() with the same name and can succeed.
Now both session 1 and 2 behave as they hold the same lock.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

At most 1 session can hold the lock.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

6.1.1
