Title: Cannot Connect to Server After Specific Statements
Description:
## Bug Report
 

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
USE test;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database0;
CREATE DATABASE database0;
USE database0;
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 CHAR);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('\''');
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('-') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c0=CAST('\r' AS SIGNED);--D
```
