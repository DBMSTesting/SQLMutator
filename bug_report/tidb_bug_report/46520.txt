Title: Encounter Duplicated entry error after pitr with non-primary-key table.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. starts a new cluster: `tiup playground --tiflash=0`
2. starts log backup
3. create table that doesn't not have primary key(make tidb use `_tidb_rowid`)
e.g. `create table test.test(id int);` 
4.  create a new full backup
5. put some data make _tidb_rowid increased. :`alter table test.test auto_increment=90001; insert into test.test values();` 
6. wait log backup checkpoint synced.
7. starts a new cluster for restore.
8. create some irrelevant tables and drop them( make this cluster `table_id` increased. so that next time restore will rewrite table prefix.
9. starts restore and check the `next_row_id` for table: `show table test.test next_row_id`.
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`_tidb_rowid` not updated. one workaround is use `alter table test.test auto_increment=120001;` to set it correctly.
