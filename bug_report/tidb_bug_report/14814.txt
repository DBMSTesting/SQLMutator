Title: Query very slow with order and limit
Description:
Hi all.
I have data about 9 million records. I try query SQL as follows:
```sql
SELECT * FROM log WHERE 1 = 1
AND log.accounting_time >= 1581267600000  
AND log.accounting_time <= 1581354000000 
ORDER BY log.recorded_time LIMIT 10, 0; 
```
 Recorded_time and accounting_time is type bigint(20).
This query SQL takes 100 seconds to complete.

So, I try to change SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM log WHERE 1 = 1;
AND log.accounting_time >= 1581267600000  
AND log.accounting_time <= 1581354000000 
ORDER BY log.recorded_time LIMIT 10000, 0; 
```
It is very fast.

And, I try to change SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM log WHERE 1 = 1
AND log.recorded_time >= 1581267600000  
AND log.recorded_time <= 1581354000000 
ORDER BY log.recorded_time LIMIT 10, 0; 
```
It is very fast, too.

So, I don't know what happened with that SQL. Can you help me?
