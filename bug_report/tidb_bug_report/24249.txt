Title: Some unit tests are not enabled and cannot pass
Description:
We use `pingcap/check` for unit testing and it requires calling `check.TestingT` in every package.

With following script, we can find some packages do not have `TestingT`:

```
 bash <(curl -Ls https://github.com/tikv/pd/raw/master/scripts/check-testing-t.sh)
```
