Title: `PhysicalLimit` should always be pushed down when possible
Description:
## Bug Report

In `pushLimitOrTopNForcibly`, we only checked the logical operator, but it's possible that a `PhysicalLimit` is from a `LogicalTopN`.

In this case, the `PhysicalLimit` would not be forced to be pushed down, which is not expected.
