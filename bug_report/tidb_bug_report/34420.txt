Title: load statement with user variable cannot handle the upper case.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, @VAR1)
  SET column2 = @VAR1/100;
```

The problem is that:
When setting the to variable into a map, TiDB uses the original text.
But when getting the variable from the map, TiDB uses the lower case text.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
