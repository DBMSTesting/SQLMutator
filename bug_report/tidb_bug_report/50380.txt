Title: AND type mv index filter mutations generating logic is wrong
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
fix the AND mv index filter mutations generating logic.
SELECT * FROM t WHERE   15975127 member of (domains)   AND 15975128 member of (domains) AND a = 1 AND b = 2
for mv index mvi(a, domains, b)
the accessFilters should be [a = 1, ?, b = 1], here ? is pos occupation here stands for set {15975127 member of (domains), 15975128 member of (domains)}
when building index partial path, we have two mutation here
a=1 and 15975127 member of (domains) and b=2
a=1 and 15975128 member of (domains) and b=2



### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
accessFilters [a = 1, 15975127 member of (domains), b = 1]
MvIndexMutations[15975127 member of (domains), 15975128 member of (domains)]
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
currently, in CollectFilters4MVIndexMutations, it will output 
```
accessFilters as [a = 1, 15975127 member of (domains), 15975128 member of (domains), b = 1]
MvIndexMutations[15975127 member of (domains), 15975128 member of (domains)]
```
which is not desirable.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
