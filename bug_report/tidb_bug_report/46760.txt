Title: Adjust the log level and returned value when `cacheableChecker` check `*ast.TableName` nodes
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. If calling `TableByName` encounters an error, we need to adjust the log level and supplement the error log. Because this error does not affect execution results.

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/41d1ec0267efae5c3263e3f611025c82c14cd177/planner/core/plan_cacheable_checker.go#L557-L609


2. Besides, if we encounter this error when calling `TableByName`, I think it makes sense to return true

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Change this log to a warning and add some info to check the cause of this error later.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`logutil.BgLogger().Error("Error occur in checking cacheable", zap.Error(err))`

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
