Title: Float calculate result changes when adding brakets
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
initialize

```
create table t0 (a decimal(5,3));
insert into t0 values(0);
insert into t0 values(0.001);
```

then execute queries below:

```
select * from t0 where a=0+1e-1-1e-1; -- return 0
select * from t0 where a=0.001+1e-1-1e-1; -- named q1
select * from t0 where a=0.001+(1e-1-1e-1); -- named q2
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The results of q1 and q2 are the same: return 0.001.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

q1 returns empty set; q2 returns 0.001.

Since it acts as MySQL, I'm not sure whether it's expected. But I think it's confusing.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
