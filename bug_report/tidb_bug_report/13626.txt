Title: Potential timezone related bugs caused by `gotime.Local` location
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
When dealing with timestamps, currently there are several pieces of codes that used `gotime.Local` as the timezone location rather than system/global/session variables, which may lead to unexpected errors:

- https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/61f24d246995ceb6181da779c934c9a05438c3a9/types/mytime.go#L79

- https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/61f24d246995ceb6181da779c934c9a05438c3a9/types/time.go#L433

- ...

  For example, #13605 is a bug caused by such codes, we should try to avoid using `gotime.Local` to prevent such errors. 

2. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
Such codes exist in all TiDB versions.
