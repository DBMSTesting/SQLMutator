Title: max_execution_time hint doesn't work if it exceed the expensive-slow-log-threshold
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
create table t (a int);
insert into t values (1);
...
insert into t values (1);
select count(*) from t;  // 62 rows
select /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(61000) */ sleep(1) from t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The query should be killed since the max execution time is `61s` but it would cost `62s`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The query is processed successfully.
```
mysql> select /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(61000) */ sleep(1) from t;
+----------+
| sleep(1) |
+----------+
|        0 |
...
|        0 |
+----------+
62 rows in set (1 min 2.09 sec)
```

### 4. Affected version (Required)
v3.0.0/v4.0.0

### 5. Root Cause Analyze
The root cause is that if a query is marked as an expensive query, we would skip checking its `max-execution-time` in the loop.
