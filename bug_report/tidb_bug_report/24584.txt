Title: ddl: admin cancel column-type-change will not release the background work goroutine
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
// Mock infinite worker logic here
```
func (w *worker) updateColumnAndIndexes(t table.Table, oldCol, col *model.ColumnInfo, idxes []*model.IndexInfo, reorgInfo *reorgInfo) error {
	// Mock infinite worker logic here
	for {
		time.Sleep( 5 * time.Second)
		fmt.Println("running")
	}
        ...
```
make
./bin/tidb-server

session1:
```
create table t(a int)
alter table t modify column a tinyint // hang over
```
session2:
```
admin show ddl jobs
admin cancel ddl jobs job_id // cancel success ! 
admin show ddl jobs     // job is rollback done
```

However, the start console still outputs the `running` log, which means the work goroutine is leaked.
