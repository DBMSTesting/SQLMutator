Title: Empty string as a auto_increment value during insert
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

I'm trying to get Discuz work with TiDB, and found a difference in behavior between TiDB and MySQL. 
For such a table:
```
CREATE TABLE pre_forum_post_tableid (
  pid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  PRIMARY KEY (pid)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```
Insert with:

`INSERT INTO pre_forum_post_tableid SET `pid`='';`

2. What did you expect to see?

With MySQL, the empty string '' will be treated as null and the query can be completed.

3. What did you see instead?

With TiDB, I got:

`(1366) Incorrect int value: '' for column 'pid' at row 1`

Discuz depends on this MySQL behavior massively, it's hard to workaround.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
