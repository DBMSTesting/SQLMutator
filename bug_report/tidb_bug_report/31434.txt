which is an index creation for a table-size = 100000 created by sysbench.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I can see these executed DDL in the UI dashboard, since they take several seconds to finish.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

According to the UI dashboard, TiDB does not report any DDL executed in several seconds:
