> 1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

Repeat executing a query. The query is
```sql
update tbl_res_user_rec_company a
  join (select company_hash_id
        from bigai.tbl_company_tag
        where (tag_key, tag_value) in ((?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?))) b on a.company_hash_id = b.company_hash_id
set delete_flag = 1
where user_id = ? and client_id = ? and delete_flag = 0
```
In most of the time, it executed successfully, but sometimes it executed failed reporting

```
com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'bigai.a' doesn't exist
```

> 2. What did you expect to see?

Always execute successfully.


> 3. What did you see instead?

Sometimes it failed.

> 4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
