2. prepare data of ycsb with configurations: 
```
-p recordcount=100000000 -p operationcount=1000000 -p workload=core -p fieldcount=10 -p fieldlength=100 -p requestdistribution=uniform1
```
4. export the data with dumpling
5. import the data into a new deploy cluster with lightning 

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
No performance regression

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
