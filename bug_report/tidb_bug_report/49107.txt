Title: Unexpected Result by REGEXP
Description:
## Bug Report

I believe this is a bug as two queries return inconsistent results.
Although the view includes a `GROUP BY`, it does not break the `only_full_group_by` attribute.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1), (2);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0, c1) AS SELECT t0.c0, (false NOT REGEXP t1.c0) LIKE 0 FROM t1, t0 GROUP BY t1.c0;

SELECT v0.c0 FROM v0; -- {2}
SELECT v0.c0 FROM v0 WHERE NOT v0.c1; -- {1}
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The first query should return 2 rows because the second query returns a different result.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The second query returns a different result as that of the first query.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
