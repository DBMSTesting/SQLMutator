## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
- during upgrade, trigger this issue https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54689 on the older node `A`
- during the upgrade there is a `ALTER TABLE mysql.tidb_runaway_queries MODIFY COLUMN `plan_digest` varchar(64) DEFAULT '';` submitted by the 8.5 node which will force to be owner, and the job is using v1 args, but it contains 8 args, below is the code of 8.5.0
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/244062f826f75494525e3ac319d0e8ad794b0a43/pkg/meta/model/job_args.go#L1690-L1694
- if the job is run on `A`, it will append args, but A only uses the first 8, the appended args is useless.
  - if the job is created by older version, the job will only have 5 args initially, will append args will work, below is the code of 8.1.0
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/945d07c5d5c7a1ae212f6013adfb187f2de24b23/pkg/ddl/ddl_api.go#L6027
- so `modifyInfo.changingCol` is nil all the time, and it's initialized and inserted into the tableinfo every time(code of 8.1.0):
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/945d07c5d5c7a1ae212f6013adfb187f2de24b23/pkg/ddl/column.go#L570-L571
- as node `A` keeps running the job, we got a tableinfo like this:
```json
{
  "id": 432102,
  "name": {
   "O": "tidb_runaway_queries",
   "L": "tidb_runaway_queries"
  },
  "charset": "utf8mb4",
  "collate": "utf8mb4_bin",
  "cols": [
..... other columns
  {
    "id": 3546,
    "name": {
     "O": "_Col$_plan_digest_3536",
     "L": "_col$_plan_digest_3536"
    },
    "offset": 3545,
.....
}
```
