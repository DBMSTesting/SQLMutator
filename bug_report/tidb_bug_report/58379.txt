Title: Vectors with infinities can be created
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
select vec_from_text('[1e39, -1e39]') _;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Invalid vector text: [1e39, -1e39]
```

(it should actually mention "infinite value not allowed in vector" as well but that's another matter)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
+-------------+
| _           |
+-------------+
| [+Inf,-Inf] |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Such vector can produce a scalar Infinity or NaN as well

```sql
mysql> select VEC_L2_NORM('[1e39]') + 1;
ERROR 1690 (22003): DOUBLE value is out of range in '(+Inf + 1)'
mysql> select VEC_L2_NORM('[1e39]')*0 + 1;
ERROR 1690 (22003): DOUBLE value is out of range in '(NaN + 1)'

```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Today's nightly.
