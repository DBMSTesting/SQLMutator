Title: Bad error message for DROP PARTITION of non-existing partition
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
create table t (a int) partition by range (a) (partition p0 values less than (1000000));
alter table t drop partition pNonExisting;
```

The issue is that the number of remaining partitions are checked before the list of partitions is verified.

**Note that we are currently bug compatible with MySQL** :)

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
tidb> create table t (a int) partition by range (a) (partition p0 values less than (1000000));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

tidb> alter table t drop partition pNonExisting;
ERROR 1507 (HY000): Error in list of partitions to DROP
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
tidb> create table t (a int) partition by range (a) (partition p0 values less than (1000000));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

tidb> alter table t drop partition pNonExisting;
ERROR 1508 (HY000): Cannot remove all partitions, use DROP TABLE instead
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
