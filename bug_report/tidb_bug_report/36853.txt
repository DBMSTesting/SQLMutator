Title: Inconsistent Results for JOIN when the join expression is from constant
Description:
## Bug Report

There is an inconsistent result returned by SELECT statements. 

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT 1 FROM t0, t1 WHERE 1;
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (2);
REPLACE INTO t1 VALUES ('2');

SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0, v0; -- {2}

SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0, v0 WHERE ELT('1', v0.c0>false); -- {2}
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0, v0 WHERE NOT (ELT('1', v0.c0>false)); -- {2}
SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0, v0 WHERE ELT('1', v0.c0>false) IS NULL; -- {2}
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The last three SELECTs return more results than expected. These conditions in the WHERE clause are mutually exclusive, but they all return the same results.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The last three SELECTs all return {2}.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
