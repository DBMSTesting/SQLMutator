Title: The meaning of `max-memory` in config has changed
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

Since the `GlobalMemoryUsageTracker` is introduced, its size is decided by `performance.max-memory` configuration. But this configuration is still used by prepared plan cache to set the maximum[ plan cache size](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/tidb-server/main.go#L593), better to remove this usage for prepare plan cache or change its name to avoid possible incorrect configurations, a single configuration should not have two usages.
