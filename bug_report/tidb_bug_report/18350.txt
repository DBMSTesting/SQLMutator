## Description
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
``` sql
CREATE TABLE tab(i INT); 
CREATE TABLE tab2(j INT); 

insert into tab values(1),(2),(3);
insert into tab2 values(1),(2),(3),(15);

SELECT m.i, 
       (SELECT COUNT(n.j) 
           FROM tab2 WHERE j=15) AS o 
    FROM tab m, tab2 n GROUP BY 1 order by m.i;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
``` sql
mysql> SELECT m.i,
         (SELECT COUNT(n.j)
             FROM tab2 WHERE j=15) AS o
      FROM tab m, tab2 n GROUP BY 1 order by m.i;
+------+------+
| i    | o    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    4 |
|    2 |    4 |
|    3 |    4 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
``` sql
tidb> SELECT m.i,
         (SELECT COUNT(n.j)
             FROM tab2 WHERE j=15) AS o
      FROM tab m, tab2 n GROUP BY 1 order by m.i;
+------+---+
| i    | o |
+------+---+
|    1 | 1 |
|    2 | 1 |
|    3 | 1 |
+------+---+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. Affected version (Required)

all the versions

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

TiDB does not handle correlated aggregate in subqueries correctly. I do not find any references from MySQL official manual, but [this doc](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.sqls.doc/ids_sqs_2115.htm) can be referred.
