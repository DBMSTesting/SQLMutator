Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?
use load data insert about 1.2 TB data to one or more tables.and then use dumpling to dump all data for specific database.

### 2. What did you expect to see?
dumpling all data successful

### 3. What did you see instead?
dumpling could stuck to restrive table rows.
found TiKV log process logs of `Command is stale`, so many error make tikv can not send normal region heartbeat and tikv will fail into `Down` state finally. After that all query specific regions in this tikv will stuck forever.
And only restart whole cluster can temporary fix this problem.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
