Title: txn: Unexpected transaction behavior when tidb connection got killed.
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step & What did you expect to see? & What did you see instead?

```sql
# mysql client 1
begin;
update cjl.test set name='111' where id=1;
```

```sql
# mysql client 2
begin;
update cjl.test set name='222' where id=1;
# blocked
```

```sql
# mysql client 3
kill tidb <connection id of mysql client 1>;
```


```sql
# mysql client 1
begin;
# > ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query
begin;
# > No connection. Trying to reconnect...
# > Connection id:    XXX
# > Current database: *** NONE ***
update cjl.test set name='111' where id=1;
```

Then either mysql client 1 or mysql client 2 should be blocked, but occationally, neither of them did.

And in that situation, if you try to commit both of them, txn in mysql client 1 will commit successfully, txn in mysql client 2 will report `PessimisticLockNotFound`. 

### 2. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Found on all 4.0 and 5.0 versions.

Note: still exists when `pessimistic-txn.pipelined='false';`
