Title: query metric error : Get "http://https//...
Description:
## Bug Report

TiDB metric query assumes http. https would be as better assumption, but we should support both and certainly test https.

```
query metric error: Get "http://https//tidb5-pd-1.tidb5-pd-peer. ...
dial tcp: lookup https on 172.20.0.10:53: no such host

in `getPrometheusAddr` this code is wrong. Generally it is best to use net/url to actually parse the url instead of performing brittle string checks.

```
        if strings.HasPrefix(pdAddrs[0], "http://") {
                url = fmt.Sprintf("%s%s", pdAddrs[0], pdapi.Config)
        } else {
                url = fmt.Sprintf("http://%s%s", pdAddrs[0], pdapi.Config)
        }
```

I wrote a helper script for generating TLS certs but @BusyJay has [refused to merge](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8829) it, I think if generating certs is easier for developers then it will be easier to test.
