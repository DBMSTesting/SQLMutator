Fix https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/2346

ComStmtExecute packet just send params type information the first time,
so PrepareStmt should save it for further use.

I've test is manually, but it's hard to add test case because Go driver just set the param flag 
and send the parameters type every time.
