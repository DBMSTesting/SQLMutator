Title: `sys` cannot be read when `tidb_isolation_read_engines` is set to `tiflash`
Description:
```
create table sys.t (id int);
insert into sys.t values (1),(2);
set tidb_isolation_read_engines='tiflash';
select * from sys.t;
```

It'll fail to select from table `t`.

It's actually not a big problem, because there isn't any table inside `sys` (the `sys.schema_unused_indexes` is a view on `information_schema`, so it works fine). However, it may cause some potential bugs in the future, so fix it asap.
