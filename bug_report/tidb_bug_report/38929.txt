Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Starts a TiDB cluster with 2 TiFlash nodes.
2. Scale in a Tiflash node.
3. Scale out a TiFlash node with a different address.

```
set @@session.tidb_allow_mpp=1;
set @@session.tidb_enforce_mpp=1;
set @@tidb_partition_prune_mode=dynamic;
```

Execute the MPP query, it is slow and prints log:

```
[batch_coprocessor.go:357] ["Store is not ready"] ["store address"=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx] ["err message"="rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx: connect: connection timed out\""]
```
