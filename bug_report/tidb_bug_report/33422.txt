Title: Record new_collation setting in br backup and compare new_collation during restore
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
- do br backup of a tidb cluster with new_collation disabled
- restore the backup to a cluster with new_collation enabled

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
- Restore should  check new_collation compatibility and fail directly if new_collation setting of target cluster is different from that in the backup. 
To archive this, we need to:
a. During br backup, we can record new_collation setting of the tidb cluster.
b. When we restore to a target cluster, br can compare new_collation setting of the target cluster with that in the backup, and prevent user from restore if they are not the same.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Currently br restored data may have checksum and index error if source tidb and target tidb has different new_collation settings, and we reply on user to make sure they are the same, which is not user friendly.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
BR 6.0.0
