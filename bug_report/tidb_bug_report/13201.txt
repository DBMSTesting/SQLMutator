Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
CREATE TABLE `test_gc_read` (
  `a` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `b` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `c` int(11) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (`a` + `b`) VIRTUAL,
  `d` int(11) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (`a` * `b`) STORED,
  `e` int(11) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (`c` * 2) VIRTUAL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`a`)
);
create table t1(a int);
insert into test_gc_read (a, b) values(3, 4);
insert into t1 values(3);
update test_gc_read set a = a + 100 where a in (select a from t1);
```

2. What did you expect to see?

Both the value of `a`, `c`, `d`, `e` changed.

3. What did you see instead?

The value of `d` is not changed.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
