Title: TiDB and MySQL behave differently when using the `IN` operator with `UNION` results of mixed data types
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
select 'abc' in ( select 0  ) as c1;
select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select cast(null as char)) ) as c2;
select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select 1 where false) ) as c3;
select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select '1' where false) ) as c4;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```sql
mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0  ) as c1;
+----+
| c1 |
+----+
|  1 |
+----+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select cast(null as char)) ) as c2;
+------+
| c2   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select 1 where false) ) as c3;
+------+
| c3   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select '1' where false) ) as c4;
+------+
| c4   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```sql
mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0  ) as c1;
+------+
| c1   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set, 2 warnings (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select cast(null as char)) ) as c2;
+------+
| c2   |
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select 1 where false) ) as c3;
+------+
| c3   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set, 2 warnings (0.00 sec)

mysql> select 'abc' in ( select 0 union all ( select '1' where false) ) as c4;
+------+
| c4   |
+------+
|    0 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
