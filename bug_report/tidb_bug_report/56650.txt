Title: TiFlash produces incorrect result when using `LAG` and `substring`
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
create table t1 (c1 int, c2 int);
alter table t1 set tiflash replica 1;
insert into t1 (c1, c2) values 
  (-82 ,  -4), 
  (  1 ,   4), 
  (-11 , -45), 
  (-20 , 142);

SELECT /*+ read_from_storage(tiflash[t1]) */ 
  c2,
  lag(1) over (partition by c1 order by c2) as a,
  substring('abc', c2) as b,
  hex(substring('abc', c2)) as bh
FROM
  t1
;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
mysql> SELECT /*+ read_from_storage(tikv[t1]) */ 
    ->   c2,
    ->   lag(1) over (partition by c1 order by c2) as a,
    ->   substring('abc', c2) as b,
    ->   hex(substring('abc', c2)) as bh
    -> FROM
    ->   t1
    -> ;
+------+------+------+------+
| c2   | a    | b    | bh   |
+------+------+------+------+
|  142 | NULL |      |      |
|  -45 | NULL |      |      |
|    4 | NULL |      |      |
|   -4 | NULL |      |      |
+------+------+------+------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Note: in the result, there's leading '\0' before 'abc'.
```
mysql> SELECT /*+ read_from_storage(tiflash[t1]) */ 
    ->   c2,
    ->   lag(1) over (partition by c1 order by c2) as a,
    ->   substring('abc', c2) as b,
    ->   hex(substring('abc', c2)) as bh
    -> FROM
    ->   t1
    -> ;
+------+------+------+----------+
| c2   | a    | b    | bh       |
+------+------+------+----------+
|   -4 | NULL |      |          |
|  -45 | NULL |      |          |
|    4 | NULL |  abc | 00616263 |
|  142 | NULL |      |          |
+------+------+------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.99 sec)
```
