Title: BR restore txn report ErrRestoreInvalidRange error, 'startKey > endKey, endKey 0000000000000000f7', when restore region's endKey is ""
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. TiKV has region endKey is ""
2. backup txn (sucess)
3. restore txn (failed)

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
restore txn always success.
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
restore txn failed with error, report startKey > endKey, endKey was `0000000000000000f7`. Due to tikv encode rule, empty byte slice will encode as `0000000000000000f7`. And also I checked my tikv cluster, it did have a region, which endKey was `""`.

Same Issue also seen in` Restore txn kv fails and reports ErrRestoreInvalidRange ` #52574 , although this issue was resolved by pr https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commit/80d4dec1c07038cf8f81746158ebca5c28720def.

but I find the br function `SplitKeysAndScatter` in `br/pkg/restore/split/client.go
`
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/br/pkg/restore/split/client.go#L536-L566 also encode the lastKey without check the lastKey is empty slices. and then it call `PaginateScanRegion`, which throw the  error.

I guess It was some issue like https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/52574

report error：
