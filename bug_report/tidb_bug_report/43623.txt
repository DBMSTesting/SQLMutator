## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Deploy a tidb without pd and tikv on your machine, then access `http://127.0.0.1:10080/plan_replayer/dump/a`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

It's trying to download a nonexistent plan replayer zip file. TiDB should handle it properly.

In the log:
```
http: panic serving 127.0.0.1:39686: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```
And there's also the stack trace, in which you can find panic from `GetAllTiDBTopology()`

master
