Title: Amending transaction accepts DDLs that changes column types but gives wrong result
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
set @@global.tidb_enable_change_column_type=true;
create table t (id int primary key, v varchar(10));
```

| session 1 | session 2 | |
|--|--|--|
| `begin;` | | |
| `insert into t values (1, "123456789");` | | |
| | `alter table t modify column v varchar(5);` | |
| `commit;` | | |
| `select * from t;` | | Gets `(1, NULL)` |


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Transaction on session 1 fails, either because not support by amend txn or value of `v` too long.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

v = NULL in the final result.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master (c9288d246c99073ff04304363dc7234d9caa5090 )
