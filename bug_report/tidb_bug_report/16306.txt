Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see?

### 3. What did you see instead?
1. GC worker doesn't re-register lock observers of dirty stores which causes these stores are always dirty.
2. GC worker doesn't register lock observers of newly added stores which causes these stores are always dirty.
3. Can't remove lock observers of cleaned stores.
4. If there are dirty stores after 3 round physical resolve lock, GC worker won't fall back to legacy procedure which breaks the data safety.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
4.0
