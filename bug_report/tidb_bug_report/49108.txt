Title: Unexpected Result by NATURAL RIGHT JOIN
Description:
## Bug Report

The expression `t0.c0 = (t1.c0 NOT LIKE FALSE)` is evaluated to `NULL` for the first query, but returns non-empty result for the second query.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 FLOAT);
INSERT IGNORE INTO t0(c0) VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2);
CREATE VIEW v1(c0) AS SELECT 'a' FROM t1;

SELECT t0.c0 = (t1.c0 NOT LIKE FALSE) FROM t1, t0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN v1; -- {NULL}
SELECT * FROM t1, t0 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN v1 WHERE t0.c0 = (t1.c0 NOT LIKE FALSE); -- {NULL|a}
```
