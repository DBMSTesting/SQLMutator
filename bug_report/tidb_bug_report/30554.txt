### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
drop table if exists t1,t2;
create table t1 (a int, c int);
insert into t1 values (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5);
create table t2 (a int, c int);
insert into t2 values (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3,3);
select group_concat(c order by (select c from t2 where t2.a=t1.a limit 1)) as grp from t1;
select group_concat(c order by (select mid(group_concat(c order by a),1,5) from t2 where t2.a=t1.a)) as grp from t1;
select group_concat(c order by (select mid(group_concat(c order by a),1,5) from t2 where t2.a=t1.a) desc) as grp from t1;
select t1.a, group_concat(c order by (select mid(group_concat(c order by a),1,5) from t2 where t2.a=t1.a)) as grp from t1 group by 1;
select t1.a, group_concat(c order by (select mid(group_concat(c order by a),1,5) from t2 where t2.a=t1.a) desc) as grp from t1 group by 1;
select group_concat(c order by (select concat(5-t1.c,group_concat(c order by a)) from t2 where t2.a=t1.a)) as grp from t1;
select group_concat(c order by (select concat(t1.c,group_concat(c)) from t2 where a=t1.a)) as grp from t1;
