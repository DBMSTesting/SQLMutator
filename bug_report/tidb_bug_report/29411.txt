Title: [Dumpling] dumpling --consistency lock doesn't lock table as expected
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Deploy tidb cluster, enable-table-lock not configured to true (by default), refer to: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/config/config.toml.example#L80-L81
2. Dumpling tidb, specifying consistency level as "--consistency lock"

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
We should check whether enable-table-lock is on before lock table. 
If enable-table-lock is not enabled, dumpling should fail directly? (to further determination)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
When --consistency lock parameters provided, dumpling will lock table by run SQL "lock table xx read", but it doesn't actually lock table as expected if enable-table-lock is not enabled, the "locked" table can still be modified/deleted when dumpling lock it. It might result in dumpling failure.
