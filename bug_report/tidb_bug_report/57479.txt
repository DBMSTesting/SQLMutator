turn on `sql_require_primary_key` and run lightning

no error

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

lightning will create some internal tables, and failed with error `Unable to create or change a table without a primary key, when the system variable 'sql_require_primary_key' is set. Add a primary key to the table or unset this variable to avoid this message. Note that tables without a primary key can cause performance problems in row-based replication, so please consult your DBA before changing this setting.` This is because these tables have no PK
