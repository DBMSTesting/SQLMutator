I think this bug is due to golang api time/time.go#AddDate.
in this api we could see comments:
```
// AddDate returns the time corresponding to adding the
// given number of years, months, and days to t.
// For example, AddDate(-1, 2, 3) applied to January 1, 2011
// returns March 4, 2010.
//
// AddDate normalizes its result in the same way that Date does,
// so, for example, adding one month to October 31 yields
// December 1, the normalized form for November 31.
func (t Time) AddDate(years int, months int, days int) Time {
   year, month, day := t.Date()
   hour, min, sec := t.Clock()
   return Date(year+years, month+Month(months), day+days, hour, min, sec, int(t.nsec()), t.Location())
}
```
it's diffs from mysql date_sub api.
we could fix it in expression/builtin_time.go

I could file a PR  to fix it (already solve it).
