Title: Sort-merge join memory accounting problem
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. open a session
2. SET @@tidb_mem_quota_query = 1 << 30; -- 1GB
3. run a large sort-merge join:  `select /*+ MERGE_JOIN(t1, t2) */ * from t1ï¼Œt2 where t1.id = t2.id;`


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The sort-merge should take 1GB memory

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

It actually took 5+ GB, sometimes reach 9GB in our use case

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
 
5.2.2


### Triage


Check this image for [the heap profiling result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107521/153682522-f5da1d89-95e4-4196-bda0-6f0bd3b292a0.svg), there are multiple parts that exceeded the 1GB limit we set

1. SortedRowContainer
2. chunkInDisk
3. chunk appendByCell
4. copIteratorWorker 

Counting in total, they are way larger than what we set to tidb_mem_quota_query.
