Title: Unexpected error message `Data truncated for column '%s' at row %d`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

The following program cause this error message:
```
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 DECIMAL);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (1);
DELETE FROM t0 WHERE (t0.c0)=('1p');
```
Not sure if this message can cause a format string bug, as `%s` and `%d` should not appear here.
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
`%s` and `%d` not appear in the error message. Should be exact table and column name.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`%s` and `%d` 

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
