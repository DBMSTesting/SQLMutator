Title: Remove getRegions call by lightning in physical import mode
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

When lightning runs in physical import mode, it runs this sql query

SELECT REGION_ID, APPROXIMATE_SIZE FROM information_schema.TIKV_REGION_STATUS WHERE TABLE_ID = ?

This call is made by each lightning process in parallel import mode and by multiple worker threads in a lightning process. It can potentially overload the PD if number of regions are too many. However, it appears that this call may be unnecessary since its purpose is to display a warning message and increment a counter in the SplitAndScatterRegionByRanges() function. Considering that lightning physical import always operates on a new table, splitting the new region should not pose any harm.
