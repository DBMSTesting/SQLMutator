Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Start a cluster and running a workload with setting `enable-collect-execution-info` as false. Scrape the heap profile on tidb-server and we can see the following case:

If we try to use `list` to see the detail in function, we can find that many little memory objects make consuming lots of memory due to collecting stats info event if we disabled it.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

As above said

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master
