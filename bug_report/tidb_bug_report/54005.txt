Title: unexpected memory usage of memory tracker
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
[data.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15817106/data.txt)
[query.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15817107/query.txt)
[schema.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15817108/schema.txt)



``` sql
# mysql -h 10.71.205.177 -uroot -P 4000 --local-infile=1 --comments
source schema.txt
source data.txt
source query.txt
```
After executing this SQL, the heap profile shows that the memory usage related to the tracker is significantly high. This behavior is unexpected.
1. The tracker's memory should not occupy such a large portion.
2. This memory is not being tracked, and therefore it is not included in the total memory usage of a single SQL statement. This can prevent the SQL from being canceled in a timely manner, potentially leading to an Out of Memory risk.
