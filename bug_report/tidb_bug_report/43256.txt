### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
The following program triggers a runtime error in CLI:

USE database41;
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 DECIMAL );
REPLACE INTO t0 VALUES (0.4117160754744159);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT NULL FROM t0 WHERE t0.c0;

SELECT v0.c0, t0.c0 FROM  v0 RIGHT  OUTER JOIN t0 ON ((v0.c0)LIKE(v0.c0)) WHERE ((v0.c0)OR( NOT EXISTS(SELECT v0.c0 AS c0 FROM v0, t0)));
