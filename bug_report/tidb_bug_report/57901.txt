Title: In memory table statistics is wrongly deleted for an unanalyzed table
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Sometimes, an unanalyzed table will only have one record in `mysql.stats_meta`. We will not find any record in `mysql.stats_histograms`.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

When we insert some rows into this table. It's in memory stats object should not be removed.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

In `TableStatsFromStorage`, the return value will be `nil` if we find no records in `mysql.stats_histograms`.
Then in the outside `Update`, the `tbl == nil` will add this table_id into `deletedTableIDs`. And memory object will be removed by `UpdateStatsCache`.

This is unexpected and can make the auto-analyze's scheduling wrong.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
