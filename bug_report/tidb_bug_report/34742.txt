Title: Can't restore exchanged partition in PiTR
Description:
## Bug Report

I use `alter table table_name exchange partition` to exchange partition and another table. But when I restored data by PiTR, data of exchanged partition and table is lost.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

(1) execute full backup

(2) start log backup

(3) create table if not exists user_test_partition (
        id int unsigned not null auto_increment,
        name varchar(64) not null,
        phone varchar(16) not null,
        gender tinyint not null,
        age tinyint unsigned not null default 0,
        created_at bigint unsigned not null default 0,
        primary key (id)
)ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
partition by range(id) (
        partition p0 values less than (10000),
        partition p1 values less than (20000),
        partition p2 values less than (30000)
);

create table if not exists user_test_no_partition (
        id int unsigned not null auto_increment,
        name varchar(64) not null,
        phone varchar(16) not null,
        gender tinyint not null,
        age tinyint unsigned not null default 0,
        created_at bigint unsigned not null default 0,
        primary key (id)
)ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

(4) insert 29999 records to user_test_partition
insert 1000 records to user_test_no_partition

(5) alter table user_test_partition exchange partition p0 with table user_test_no_partition;
after this step, user_test_partition has 21000 records and user_test_no_partition has 9999 records.

(6) stop log backup

(7) execute br restore point to restore full backup and log backup

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

user_test_partition has 21000 records and user_test_no_partition has 9999 records.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

user_test_partition has 20000 records and user_test_no_partition has 0 record.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.1.0-alpha-nightly-20220513
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
