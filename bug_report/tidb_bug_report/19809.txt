Title: LOAD DATA behavior change causes upgrade issue
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

See my [comment here](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/issues/3155#issuecomment-687253114) and https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pull/3838

There is an issue in that to restore the previous behavior for `LOAD DATA`, because `tidb_dml_batch_size` is only session scope. Therefore, you must `SET tidb_dml_batch_size=20000` for each session, but there are some common cases where that is hard to do:

- It is a closed source app (and they can't modify the code)
- The client library handles session scope in a weird way (by default Golang uses a connection pool, and will only provide session scope guarantees with a connection pool).

Because this is a breaking change, I propose allowing `GLOBAL | SESSION` scope. This will allow an upgrade path, because the TiDB server can be set to the previous behavior.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

A small change: tidb_dml_batch_size is SESSION | GLOBAL scope. I prefer the new behavior, I am just concerned about upgrades.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

SESSION scope only

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
