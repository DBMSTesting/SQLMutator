Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. start tidb cluster `tiup playground nightly --tiflash=0`
2. start log backup `tiup br:nightly log start -s "local:///tmp/logx" --task-name=c`
3. **drop test database first and re-create it later in workload**.
4. start full backup `tiup br:nightly backup full -s "local:///tmp/fullx"`
5. create database `test` and some data into`test` database;
```
MySQL [test]> create table t(id int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)

MySQL [test]> insert into t values(1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

MySQL [test]> select * from t;
+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
```
6. wait for the checkpoint advanced and start another cluster.
7. doing a PITR to another cluster
```
tiup br:nightly restore point -s "local:///tmp/logx" --full-backup-storage "local:///tmp/fullx" --pd 127.0.0.1:39656
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
data is correct and cluster should handle test database correct.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
data is correct but **cluster cannot drop new restore table on test database**.
```
MySQL [test]> select * from t;
+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

MySQL [test]> drop table test.t;
ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.t'
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
