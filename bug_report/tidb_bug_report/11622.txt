Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

create table t(c1 int, c2 varchar(255));

insert into t values(1,'a'),(2,'d'),(3,'c');

SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT t1.c1, t1.c2, @c3 := 1 + @c3 AS c3
	FROM (
		SELECT t.*, @c3 := 0
		FROM t
		ORDER BY t.c1
	) t1
) t01
WHERE t01.c3 = 2
	AND t01.c2 = 'd';

2. What did you expect to see?

```mysql
+------+------+------+
| c1   | c2   | c3   |
+------+------+------+
|    2 | d    | 2    |
+------+------+------+
```

3. What did you see instead?

Empty set

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
