Title: server: TiDB cannot read the client's remote address in PROXY protocol header
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. start TiDB server with PROXY protocol enabled
2. configure a haproxy and enable PROXY protocol to backend
3. use `mysql` command connect to TiDB server
4. use `show processlist;` check the client IP and port

It will show the IP and port from Haproxy server.
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

`show processlist;` should show client IP and port that connected to Haproxy.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

`show processlist;` shows Haproxy server's IP and port.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

from TiDB 6.3.0 to master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

### 5. Reason

From TiDB 6.3.0 it introduce the PROXY protocol lazy mode that can let proxyprotocol library can parse the PROXY protocol header when first `Read` function call. But at `server/conn.go` function `PeerHost` it will cache the connection remote address at first call. And `server/server.go` function `startNetworkListener` it will call `PeerHost` before do the mysql protocol handshake. At that time, the `conn.Read` not called anymore, so the remote address is connection's remote address not the remote address in PROXY protocol header.
