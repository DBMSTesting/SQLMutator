Title: potential OOM risk
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
[50544
](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50544)   identified an issue with the load factor change in the go1.21 map implementation. This can lead to a problem in TiDB where the tracked memory usage of the map is less than the actual usage, posing a potential risk of OOM. We need to adapt to the specific load factor value of this particular version of Golang's map to mitigate the risk.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
All tidb versions compiled with go1.21.x
