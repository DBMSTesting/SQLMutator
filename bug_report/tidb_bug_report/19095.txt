Title: SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES displays SESSION only variables
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No session only variables are displayed.

In MySQL, `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES` will not display SESSION variables like `last_insert_id`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Some session only variables are also displayed, like `tidb_enable_slow_log`.

Note, these variables cannot be called using `SET GLOBAL`:

```
mysql> set global tidb_enable_slow_log=0;
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Variable 'tidb_enable_slow_log' is a SESSION variable and can't be used with SET GLOBAL
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```
