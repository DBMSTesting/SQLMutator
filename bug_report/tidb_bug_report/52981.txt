Title: `var_pop` on constant values may produce wrong result.
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Firstly, execute `init.sql` to create the table. Then executing `error.sql` yields unexpected results. Note that reproducing these results might not be entirely stable. Typically, it can be completed within three attempts. You can try executing `error.sql` multiple times or execute `init.sql` again to rebuild the table.

[error.sql.txt](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/files/15147039/error.sql.txt)

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The SQL statement calculates the var_pop value of the constant expression `604102521670485727`, and the result should be 0.


### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
However, the statement results are unstable; in both the multi-node and single-node versions, there are some 0 and non-zero values.

### about us
We are the BASS team from the School of Cyber Science and Technology at Beihang University. Our main focus is on system software security, operating systems, and program analysis research, as well as the development of automated program testing frameworks for detecting software defects. Using our self-developed database vulnerability testing tool, we have identified the above-mentioned vulnerabilities in TiDB that may lead to database logic error.
