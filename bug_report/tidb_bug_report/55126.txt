Title: planner: `tot_col_size` in mysql.stats_histograms might be a negative number 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

It seems like the negative number is caused by this modification: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/v6.5.6/table/tables/tables.go#L477-L490


The current method to maintain the `col_size`:
1. update `mysql.stats_histograms.tot_col_size` each time when there is a DML statement (see https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/v6.5.6/table/tables/tables.go#L477-L490);
2. calculate `avg_col_size` by `mysql.stats_histograms.tot_col_size / mysql.stats_histograms.not_null_count` when actually using it in the cost model;

The behavior above seems overly complex, which might cause unexpected result like the negative number here. 
A better/simpler/robuster way to maintain `avg_col_size` seems to calculate and store it directly in `analyze`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The tot_col_size should be equal or large than 0.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

A negative number.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

`v6.5.6`
