Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/90e272abc31d22024c36ab095544bf20ba7f3575/pkg/plugin/plugin.go#L279-L289

This above code does not handle case `watchChan` closed, so `refreshPluginState` will be called frequently when this happens.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

When `watchChan` closed , we should close watch chan

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

closed chan is not handled correctly
