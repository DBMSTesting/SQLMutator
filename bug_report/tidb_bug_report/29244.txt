Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
drop table t;
create table t(a time(4));
insert into t values("-700:10:10.123456111");
set tidb_enable_vectorized_expression = on;
select microsecond(a) from t;
set tidb_enable_vectorized_expression = off;
select microsecond(a) from t;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Same result.
```
[tidb]> select microsecond(a) from t;
+----------------+
| microsecond(a) |
+----------------+
|         123500 |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
[tidb]> set tidb_enable_vectorized_expression = on;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.000 sec)

[tidb]> select microsecond(a) from t;
+----------------+
| microsecond(a) |
+----------------+
|        -123500 |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)

[tidb]> set tidb_enable_vectorized_expression = off;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.000 sec)

[tidb]> select microsecond(a) from t;
+----------------+
| microsecond(a) |
+----------------+
|         123500 |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
