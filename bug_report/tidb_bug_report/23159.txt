Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
mysql> create table if not exists `t` (`id` bigint);
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> split table `t` between (-9223372036854775808) and (9223372036854775807) regions 4;
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Split table `t` region step value should more than 1000, step 0 is invalid
```
This happens because `step` value is overflowed while calculating it.
