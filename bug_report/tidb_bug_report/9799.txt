## Description
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
set @p1=3;
prepare stmt from "select ntile(?) over() from t;";
execute stmt using @p1;
```

2. What did you expect to see?

execute successfully.

3. What did you see instead?

Error happened. It seems that NTILE treat the paramMarker as string instead of int.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
