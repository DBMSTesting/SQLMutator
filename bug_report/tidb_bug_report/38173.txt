Line 177 may give a false positive result about schema check. The situation is:
(1) when the server is restarted, the s.deltaSchemaInfos is empty.
(2) get the current schema version X
(3) do some DDL about table T1, then the schema version increase to Y
(4) validate schema change for another table T2, the result is true, returned by line 177.

the fix maybe:
add one more condition in line 173: s.deltaSchemaInfos is full

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
validator returns false for table T2

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
validator returns true for table T2
