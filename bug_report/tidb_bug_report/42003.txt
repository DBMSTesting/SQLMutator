Title: query `information_schema.tables` will report table not exists
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. create a table that contains an auto_increament column and then drop the table
2. run query `SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables`

parallel run these two steps several times, you may get an error `Table xxx doesn't exist`

this is because https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/5ff5b346912924d10af609d081933aaad46536ae/executor/infoschema_reader.go#L687-L692 
`getAutoIncrementID` will use the newest schema that the table has been dropped.
sleep seconds at L687 will easier to reproduce this bug

similar with https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/41622
