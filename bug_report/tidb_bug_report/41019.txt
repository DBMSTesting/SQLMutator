Title: TTL task reschedule could be an endless loop
Description:
If the `reschedule` logic is facing the unrecoverable error, it will be an endless loop. It will not only block the task manager, it'll also block all TTL schedule logic.

The most common situation is that the information schema cache doesn't contain the table.
