Title: storage: The S3-compatible API of Google Cloud Storage does not support DeleteObjects
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Create a GCS bucket.
2. Create a TiCDC v7.6 changefeed with redo-log enabled (setting `consistent.level = 'eventual'`), and set the storage to `s3://bucket/?endpoint=http://storage.googleapis.com` (thus accessing GCS through their [S3-compatible XML API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/overview)).
3. Wait for a while.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No error.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Changefeed stopped because of incompatible API:

```
[2024/02/01 00:00:00.000 +00:00] [WARN] [meta_manager.go:159] ["redo: init redo meta fail"] [namespace=default] [changefeed=«redacted»] [error="[CDC:ErrS3StorageAPI]external storage api: NotImplemented: A header or query you provided requested a function that is not implemented.\n\tstatus code: 400, request id: , host id: "]
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v7.6.0
