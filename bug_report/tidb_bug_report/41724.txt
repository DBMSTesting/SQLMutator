Title: Some tests panics when running all tests with tidb_pessimistic_txn_aggressive_locking globally enabled
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Change the default value of variable `tidb_pessimistic_txn_aggressive_locking` to true in the code, then run all unit tests

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Everything goes well.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Some test cases fails:

```
Error 1105: Trying to start aggressive locking while it's already started
```

After some investigation, it's found to be caused by not exiting aggressive locking after executing the previous statement in the transaction.

For example, `TestRcTSOCmdCountForPrepareExecuteExtra` panics because TiDB's `ast.IsReadOnly` regards a select statement with a select-for-update subquery to be readonly (which is wrong). This causes `StmtCommit` or `StmtRollback` (which are responsible to exit aggressive locking if it's active) not invoked after finishing the statement.

`show_profile` in mysql-test panics in a similar way, but it's not successfully reproduced.

This means exiting aggressive locking in `StmtCommit` or `StmtRollback` is a bad idea since TiDB has complicated and even maybe incorrect logic to determine whether `StmtCommit` or `StmtRollback` needs to be called after finishing a statement. We'd better exit aggressive locking within `handlePessimisticDML` and `handlePessimisticSelectForUpdate`, which is also the place that enters aggressive locking. 

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
