Title: Aliasing a table with DELETE FROM is syntax error
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```sql
CREATE TABLE x (a INT);
DELETE FROM x t WHERE t.a = 4;
DELETE FROM x AS t WHERE t.a = 4;
```

2. What did you expect to see?

The 2nd and 3rd statements executed successfully (both should be equivalent to `DELETE FROM x WHERE a = 4`).

3. What did you see instead?

Both of them are syntax error.

```
mysql> DELETE FROM x t WHERE t.a = 4;
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 15 near "t WHERE t.a = 4" 
mysql> DELETE FROM x AS t WHERE t.a = 4;
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 16 near "AS t WHERE t.a = 4" 
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
