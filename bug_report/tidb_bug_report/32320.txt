Title: Tiflash is out of memory on huge select with simple data transformation
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step

1. Create table.
```sql
create table messages
(
    message_hash  varbinary(32)                                  not null
        primary key,
    src_workchain tinyint                                        not null,
    src_address   varbinary(32)                                  null,
    dst_workchain tinyint                                        not null,
    dst_address   varbinary(32)                                  null,
    message_type  enum ('Internal', 'ExternalIn', 'ExternalOut') not null,
    message_value bigint unsigned                                not null,
    ihr_fee       bigint unsigned                                not null,
    fwd_fee       bigint unsigned                                not null,
    import_fee    bigint unsigned                                not null,
    created_lt    bigint unsigned                                not null,
    created_at    int unsigned                                   not null,
    body          mediumblob                                     null,
    state_init    mediumblob                                     null,
    bounced       tinyint(1)                                     not null,
    bounce        tinyint(1)                                     not null
);
```
2. Fill it with 100m+ rows of data.

3. Replicate table to 1 tiflash instanse.
4. Execute query: 
```sql
select
       created_at,
       concat(src_workchain, ':', lower(hex(src_address))) as src,
       concat(dst_workchain, ':', lower(hex(dst_address))) as dst,
       message_value
from messages
where created_at > 0
  and message_value > 0;
```

Forcing db to use tikv fixes the problem, but it's strange that it fails on tiflash.
