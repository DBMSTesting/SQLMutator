Title: Tidb crashes when sql with shuffleExec quit unexpectedly
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```
use test;
drop table if exists t1;
create table t1(i int, j int, k int);
insert into t1 VALUES (1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3),(4,4,4);
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT 10*i,j,5*j FROM t1 UNION SELECT 20*i,j,5*j FROM t1 UNION SELECT 30*i,j,5*j FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT 10*i,j,5*j FROM t1 UNION SELECT 20*i,j,5*j FROM t1 UNION SELECT 30*i,j,5*j FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT 10*i,j,5*j FROM t1 UNION SELECT 20*i,j,5*j FROM t1 UNION SELECT 30*i,j,5*j FROM t1;
set @@session.tidb_enable_window_function=1;
set tidb_window_concurrency = 128;
set tidb_mem_quota_query = 13000;
```

run the sql many times(more than 100000 times):
SELECT SUM(i) OVER W FROM t1 WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY j ORDER BY i) ORDER BY 1+SUM(i) OVER w;
