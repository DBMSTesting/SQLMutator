Title: panic may happen when limit is on top of window functions
Description:
## Development Task

```
create table t(a int);
insert into t values(1);
select count(a) f1, row_number() over (order by count(a)) as f2 from t limit 1;
```

the select query would panic. Root cause is that, wrong column pruning for limit would lead to a bad plan that the schema of limit has more columns than its child schema.

The problem is incurred by https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/20288 when trying to do inline projection for limit, which changes limit from `baseLogicalPlan` to a `logicalSchemaProducer`.
