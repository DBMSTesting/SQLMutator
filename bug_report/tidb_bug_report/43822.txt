Title: LDAP authentication should support the server which doesn't allow anonymous bind
Description:
TiDB uses an anonymous bind to detect whether the connection is alive. However, there are some servers which don't support anonymous bind (e.g. the okta LDAP service).

I propose to simple bind with the `root_dn` and `root_pwd` to detect whether the connection is alive. It's also compatible with the original anonymous bind behavior if the `root_dn` and `root_pwd` are set to empty (by default, if the user doesn't need searching).

## Alternatives

I have checked the behavior on two different implementations:

1. Percona server, as shown in its code, will also use `root_dn` and `root_pwd` to initialize the connection.
2. MySQL server doesn't detect the connection status. If a connection is killed (or lost) from the server side, the connection will pollute the connection pool, and all following login will fail. (`tcpdump` on the LDAP server, no request will arrive).

I think the first one is apparently better.
