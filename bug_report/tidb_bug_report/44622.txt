Title: Retry on BatchCoprocessor request may fail randomly 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!
The root cause is when retry a batch coprocessor request, we just collect the key ranges in the failed batch coprocessor request:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/1837efe5286d8cf82933ccec5117e50d5a27dcd8/store/copr/batch_coprocessor.go#L1094-L1123

But, for `buildBatchCopTasksForNonPartitionedTable` and `buildBatchCopTasksForPartitionedTable`, it actually assumes that the input key ranges is sorted. So an unsorted input may cause wrong result in `SplitKeyRangesByLocations`, and TiFlash may throw errors like 
`Error 1105 (HY000): [FLASH:Coprocessor:BadRequest] Income key ranges is illegal for region: 326: (while doing learner read for table, logical table_id: 2593)`
