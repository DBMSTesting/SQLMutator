Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
/* init */ CREATE TABLE t0(c0 DOUBLE UNIQUE);
/* init */ INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (9.1);

/* tx1 */ BEGIN;
/* tx1 */ INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (2.0);
/* tx1 */ REPLACE INTO t0(c0) VALUES (9.1);
/* tx2 */ BEGIN;
/* tx2 */ DELETE FROM t0;
/* tx2 */ COMMIT;
/* tx1 */ COMMIT;
/* tx1 */ SELECT * FROM t0;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

DELETE statement is blocked (in MySQL), or the final SELECT statement returns [(2.0), (9.1)].

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The final SELECT statement returns [(2.0)].

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
