Title: greatest() sql function uses connection collation and not collation of columns
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Enable the new collation framework first. Then use the following test case:

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t2;
CREATE TABLE t2 (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,
  `col_91` char(47) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `col_92` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT '2478966067',
  `col_97` char(32) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin NOT NULL
) collate utf8mb4_general_ci;

INSERT INTO `t2` VALUES 
(17,'UUtJeaV',497551109,'snRXXCZHBPW');

SET names utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_bin;
-- correct:
SELECT
 id,
 greatest( col_92 , col_91 , col_97 ) as expr1
FROM t2 
ORDER BY id;

SET names utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_general_ci;
-- uses collation from connection and not columns (incorrect)
SELECT
 id,
 greatest( col_92 , col_91 , col_97 ) as expr1
FROM t2 
ORDER BY id;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```sql
mysql [localhost:8027] {msandbox} (test) > SELECT
    ->  id,
    ->  greatest( col_92 , col_91 , col_97 ) as expr1
    -> FROM t2 
    -> ORDER BY id;
+----+-------------+
| id | expr1       |
+----+-------------+
| 17 | snRXXCZHBPW |
+----+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql [localhost:8027] {msandbox} (test) > 
mysql [localhost:8027] {msandbox} (test) > SET names utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_general_ci;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql [localhost:8027] {msandbox} (test) > -- uses collation from connection and not columns (incorrect)
mysql [localhost:8027] {msandbox} (test) > SELECT
    ->  id,
    ->  greatest( col_92 , col_91 , col_97 ) as expr1
    -> FROM t2 
    -> ORDER BY id;
+----+-------------+
| id | expr1       |
+----+-------------+
| 17 | snRXXCZHBPW |
+----+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
tidb> -- correct:
tidb> SELECT
    ->  id,
    ->  greatest( col_92 , col_91 , col_97 ) as expr1
    -> FROM t2 
    -> ORDER BY id;
+----+-------------+
| id | expr1       |
+----+-------------+
| 17 | snRXXCZHBPW |
+----+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

tidb> 
tidb> SET names utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_general_ci;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

tidb> -- uses collation from connection and not columns (incorrect)
tidb> SELECT
    ->  id,
    ->  greatest( col_92 , col_91 , col_97 ) as expr1
    -> FROM t2 
    -> ORDER BY id;
+----+---------+
| id | expr1   |
+----+---------+
| 17 | UUtJeaV |
+----+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
