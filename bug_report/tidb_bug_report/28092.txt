Title: UPDATE has inconsistent behaviors in a transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
/* init */ create table t(a blob not null, b text);
/* init */ insert ignore into t values (null, null), (null, 'abc');  -- [0]
```

It should be noted that the behavior of "INSERT IGNORE" is confusing, the statement [0] will execute successfully even through there is a NOT NULL constraint on column a. So the initialized table is like:
```
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
| NULL | NULL |
| NULL | abc  |
+------+------+
```
This is compatible with MySQL.
Now, start a transaction and execute the following statements:
```
/* s1 */ begin;
/* s1 */ update t set b = 'test' where a; -- [1]
/* s1 */ rollback;

/* s1 */ begin;
/* s1 */ update t set b = 'def';
/* s1 */ update t set b = 'test' where a; -- [2]
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The two UPDATE statements [1] and [2] have the same results

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The first UPDATE [1] executes correctly while the second UPDATE [2] gets an error:
```
mysql> begin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> update t set b = 'test' where a;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 0  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> rollback;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> begin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> update t set b = 'def';
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 2  Changed: 2  Warnings: 0

mysql> update t set b = 'test' where a;
ERROR 1292 (22007): Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value: ''
```

By the way, this error will not happen in MySQL.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

mysql> select version();
```
+--------------------+
| version()          |
+--------------------+
| 5.7.25-TiDB-v5.2.1 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
