## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

When upgrading TiDB, the DDL in bootstrap got stuck, resulting in the new TiDB not being able to start.
The problem was found that the local available disk space is less than 10%, and then the fast reorg did not roll back to txn reorg.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

TiDB should start normally.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

TiDB cannot start.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
