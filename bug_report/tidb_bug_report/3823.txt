Title: node.Text() incorrect in nested statements
Description:
I was trying to output `sel.Text()` in function `func (b *planBuilder) buildSelect(sel *ast.SelectStmt) LogicalPlan` of `logical_plan_builder.go`:

```go
fmt.Printf("sel.Text() = %s\n", sel.Text())
```

It works well in simple cases but gives wrong SQL statement in nested statements:

```
sel.Text() = select * from t2 where hello in (select hello from t1)   // outer, correct
sel.Text() = (select hello from t   // inner, incorrect
```
