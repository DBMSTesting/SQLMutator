Title: charset: incorrect encoding for `latin1` character set
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
tidb> create table t(a varchar(10));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)
```

case 1:
```
tidb> insert into t values ('¥');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
tidb> select hex(a) from t;
```
case 2:
```
tidb> insert into t values ('中');
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
tidb> select hex(a) from t;
+--------+
| hex(a) |
+--------+
| A5   |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
case 2:
```
mysql> insert into t values ('中');
ERROR 1366 (HY000): Incorrect string value: '\xE4\xB8\xAD' for column 'a' at row 1
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
case 1:
```
tidb> select hex(a) from t;
+--------+
| hex(a) |
+--------+
| C2A5   |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
The encoding of `¥` in `latin` should be `A5`.

case 2:
```
tidb> insert into t values ('中');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

### 4. Affected version (Required)

All versions of TiDB

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

In TiDB, we treat `latin1` as a subset of `utf8`/`utf8mb4` and encoded the characters as UTF8, just like what we did for `ascii`.

But, it is NOT: `latin1` is a single-byte encoding character set:
1. It supports 255 characters only
2. for characters with codepoints in 128-255, the encoding is different with UTF8.
