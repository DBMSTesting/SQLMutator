Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-Incorrect result for LEFT JOIN AND NULLIF
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#45

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INTEGER);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (0);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (0);
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t0 ON t0.c0=t1.c0 WHERE NOT NULLIF(t1.c0, t0.c0); --expected: {}, actual: {0, NULL}
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` fetches a row:
```

+------+------+
|    0 | NULL |

```

Small changes that should result in the same result set fetch an empty result set, as expected:
```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t0 ON t0.c0=t1.c0 WHERE NOT NULLIF(0, t0.c0); -- {}
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t0 ON t0.c0=0 WHERE NOT NULLIF(t1.c0, t0.c0); -- {}
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t0 ON TRUE WHERE NOT NULLIF(t1.c0, t0.c0); -- {}
``` 
I found this based on the latest master commit (a1dc18da4b712067beecf1032885869040010d62), and can also reproduce this on the 4.0 RC.

When using MySQL 8.0.19, this works as expected:
