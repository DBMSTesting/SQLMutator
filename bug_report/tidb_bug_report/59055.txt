Title: DDL notifier does not guarantee delivery when internal SQL failed to COMMIT
Description:
## Bug Report

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/c34a6b69f66ed080bfd4938ae51e134fc70b917d/pkg/ddl/notifier/subscribe.go#L275-L296

If `handler` runs without error, DDL notifier marks the in-memory structure `change` as processed in line 295. However the `handler` may still fail in line 277 when commits. The `change` uses the same SQL transaction so the wrong processed state is not persisted, but the memory state of `change` is used afterward and causes problems
