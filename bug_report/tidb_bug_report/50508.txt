Title: `opentracing.enable` not work after v7.1.0
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

First start `jaeger` with command below
```
docker run --rm -d -p6831:6831/udp -p16686:16686 --name jaeger jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

Use the config below to start a TiDB cluster

run SQL below

```sql
create table t(a int);
insert into t values (1);
select *, sleep(0.1) from t;
```

Then access `Jaeger UI` to get trace information.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

See SQL related information, like

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Nothing related with slow sql.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Happened after `v7.1.0`
