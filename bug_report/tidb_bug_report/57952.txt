Title: snapshot infoschema should block GC
Description:
## Enhancement

Currently, the meta package use old transaction API, unlike normal internal transaction, those APIs can not block the GC safepoint advancing (not updating min start ts).

This may cause "GC life time is shorter than transaction duration" error for InfoSchema V2.



Maybe a possible fix is collect the min start ts of all snapshot infoschemas.
