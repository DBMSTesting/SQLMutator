## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
set @@sql_mode = default;
drop table if exists t1,t2;
CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1), (2);
SELECT a FROM t1 ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(t1.a) FROM t1 AS t2);
SELECT SUM(a) FROM t1 ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(t1.a) FROM t1 AS t2);
SELECT SUM(a) FROM t1 ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(t2.a) FROM t1 AS t2);

```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```sql
mysql> set @@sql_mode = default;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> drop table if exists t1,t2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER);

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1), (2);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT a FROM t1 ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(t1.a) FROM t1 AS t2);
ERROR 3029 (HY000): Expression #1 of ORDER BY contains aggregate function and applies to the result of a non-aggregated query
mysql> SELECT SUM(a) FROM t1 ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(t1.a) FROM t1 AS t2);
