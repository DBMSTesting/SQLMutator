Title: Can't drop column with auto_increment
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

``` mysql
create table t (a int, b int auto_increment, key(b));
alter table t drop column b;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

We could use `modify column` to delete the auto_increment ID, so drop column with auto_increment should work.

```
create table t (a int, b int auto_increment, key(b));
alter table t modify column b int(11) not null;
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

get error, error msg
```
ERROR 1075 (42000): Incorrect table definition; there can be only one auto column and it must be defined as a key
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
