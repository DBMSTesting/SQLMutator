Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
```sql
mysql> select @@session.tx_read_only;
+------------------------+
| @@session.tx_read_only |
+------------------------+
|                      0 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> set session transaction read only;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select @@session.tx_read_only;
+------------------------+
| @@session.tx_read_only |
+------------------------+
|                      1 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> 
```

2. What did you expect to see?
@@session.tx_read_only should be 1 after executing `set session transaction read only;`


3. What did you see instead?
@@session.tx_read_only still be 0


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
All tidb-server versions could reproduce this issue.
