### 1. What did you do?
[randgen_semijoin_INL_HASH_AGG.txt](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/files/4443425/randgen_semijoin_INL_HASH_AGG.txt)
```
source randgen_semijoin_INL_HASH_AGG.txt

SELECT   OUTR . `col_varchar_1` AS X FROM S AS OUTR WHERE ( OUTR . `col_int_key` , OUTR . `col_int` ) IN ( SELECT  INNR . `col_int_key` AS X , INNR . `col_int` AS Y FROM B AS INNR WHERE INNR . `col_date_key` <> '2008-09-21' OR NOT OUTR . `col_date` IS NULL  ) AND OUTR . `col_varchar_10` >= 'y' XOR OUTR . `col_date` IS NULL  ORDER BY OUTR . `col_varchar_10_key` , OUTR . `pk`;

```
```
SELECT /*+ hash_JOIN(OUTR,OUTR2,INNR,INNR2) */  OUTR . `col_varchar_1_key` AS X FROM A AS OUTR WHERE ( OUTR . `col_varchar_10_key` , OUTR . `col_varchar_10_key` ) IN ( SELECT  INNR . `col_varchar_1_key` AS X , INNR . `col_varchar_10_key` AS Y FROM B AS INNR2 LEFT JOIN P AS INNR ON ( INNR2 . `col_date_key` <> INNR . `col_date` ) WHERE OUTR . `col_date` IS NOT NULL  ) AND OUTR . `col_int_key` > 5 XOR OUTR . `col_varchar_10_key` IS NULL ORDER BY OUTR . `col_varchar_10` , OUTR . `pk`;
```
```
SELECT /*+ hash_agg(),INL_JOIN(OUTR,OUTR2,INNR,INNR2) */ DISTINCT OUTR . `col_varchar_10` AS X FROM O AS OUTR WHERE ( OUTR . `col_varchar_1` , OUTR . `col_varchar_10` ) IN ( SELECT DISTINCT INNR . `col_varchar_10` AS X , INNR . `col_varchar_1_key` AS Y FROM U AS INNR2 LEFT JOIN U AS INNR ON ( INNR2 . `col_varchar_10` > INNR . `col_varchar_10_key` ) WHERE INNR . `col_int_key` >= 3  ) AND OUTR . `col_int` < 7 XOR OUTR . `col_varchar_10_key` <= 'm'  ORDER BY OUTR . `col_date_key` , OUTR . `pk`;
