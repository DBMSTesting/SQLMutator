### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
create table t(a varchar(10) collate utf8_general_ci, b char(10) collate utf8_general_ci);
insert into t values ('a', 'รก'),('aa', 'A '),('b', 'B'),('c', 'c'),(' ', ''); 
select * from t t1 where (t1.a, t1.b) in (select b, a from t t2); 
```
utf8mb4_general_ci, utf8_unicode_ci, utf8mb4_unicode_ci has the same problem.
