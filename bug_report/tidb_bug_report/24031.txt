Title: Killing connections needs cooperation from the to-be-killed connection
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

- Run TiDB playground.
- Connect two sessions with `mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 -u root -p`
- From connection A: run `SHOW PROCESSLIST` and get the connection ID of the other connection (`mysql` reports its own connection id when starting up)
- Now from connection A issue: `KILL TIDB CONNECTION <id>` where ID is the connection ID of the other connection.
- Now run `SHOW PROCESSLIST` again.

Note that this is with a single `tidb` node.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The killed connection gone from the processlist.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The other connection still being in the processlist until it tries to run a query.

Once a query like `do 1` is attempted on connection B the connection is gone from the processlist and connection B shows `ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query`

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
