Title: The query in slow log can't be parsed when there is single comment in sql
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
If we execute the sql with tidb, and image it is a slow query.
```sql
select count(*) from t x ,t y
-- condition
where x.a<y.a
and x.a is not null -- comment
```
The query recorded in tidb slow log is ```select count(*) from t x ,t y -- condition where x.a<y.a  and x.a is not null -- comment;``` , and we can't parse the sql correctly because we can't identify which sentences are commented.
Compared with tidbï¼Œthe mysql slow query in the log is
```
select count(*) from t x ,t y
-- condition
where x.a<y.a
and x.a is not null -- comment;
```
