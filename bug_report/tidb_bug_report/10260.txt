Title: tidb-server does not shutdown gracefully if pd-server and/or tikv-server have gone away
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
When shutting down an entire cluster, tidb-server does not handle its own shutdown well if pd-server and/or tikv-server have already exited.

2. What did you expect to see?

tidb-server's signal handler should be able to override the loops to re-establish communication with pd and tikv.

3. What did you see instead?

Even after receiving sigterm, tidb-server runs for more than 60 seconds and outputs more than 2000 lines to the log.

```
[test@localhost tidb-latest-linux-amd64]$ grep -n signal tidb.log
256:[2019/04/24 15:59:35.564 -04:00] [INFO] [signal_posix.go:54] ["got signal to exit"] [signal=terminated]
350:[2019/04/24 16:33:57.701 -04:00] [INFO] [signal_posix.go:54] ["got signal to exit"] [signal=terminated]
[test@localhost tidb-latest-linux-amd64]$ wc -l tidb.log
3021 tidb.log
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
