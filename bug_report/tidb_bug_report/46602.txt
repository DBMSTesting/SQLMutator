Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

TiFlash node `db-tiflash-1` went down due to disk failure and became tombstone state later. About two weeks after that, TiDB logs were still seeing probe warn messages, like this:
```
[WARN] [mpp_probe.go:246] ["Store is not ready"] ["store address"=db-tiflash-1.db-tiflash-peer.tidb1311285575352848384.svc:3930] ["err message"="rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp: lookup db-tiflash-1.db-tiflash-peer.tidb1311285575352848384.svc: no such host\""]
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

TiFlash mpp task should not send probe requests to tomebstone store.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Tombstone store is not filtered.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.5.3
