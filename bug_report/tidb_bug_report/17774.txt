Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Hint]-INL_HASH_JOIN hint causes an incorrect result for a table with a generated column
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#50

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT AS (0) VIRTUAL, c1 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (0);
SELECT /*+ INL_HASH_JOIN(t1, t0)*/t1.c0 FROM t1 NATURAL LEFT JOIN t0 WHERE NOT t1.c0; -- expected: {0}, actual: {}
```
Unexpectedly, the query does not fetch the row:
```

mysql> CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT AS (0) VIRTUAL, c1 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (0);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT /*+ INL_HASH_JOIN(t1, t0)*/t1.c0 FROM t1 NATURAL LEFT JOIN t0 WHERE NOT t1.c0;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
When removing the index hint `/*+ INL_HASH_JOIN(t1, t0)*`, the query works as expected.

I found this based on the latest master commit b6fcc157442894f048c1cc65cfcc7776e9ed1a72, and can also reproduce it on the 4.0 RC.
