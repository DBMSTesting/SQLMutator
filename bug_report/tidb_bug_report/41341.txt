Title: The IP for slow_query and auth are wrong when proxy protocol is enabled
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. Use NLB and enables proxy-protocol
2. Start TiDB with proxy-protocol enabled
3. Send a slow query such as `do sleep(1)`
4. Query the slow query by `select host from information_schema.slow_query where conn_id=connection_id()`
5. Create a MySQL account with IP, such as `u1@244.6.7.8`, where the IP is the client IP
6. Login with the IP

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In step 4, the host should be the client IP, not the proxy IP
In step 6, login should succeed

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

In step 4, the host is the proxy IP
In step 6, access is denied

The reason:
- With NLB, the proxy protocol is parsed **AFTER** the first handshake response. (With HAProxy, it's parsed before the first handshake response)
- The `clientConn.peerHost` is initialized **BEFORE** the first handshake response, so it's the proxy IP, instead of the client IP
- Slow query and authentication both use `clientConn.peerHost`

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
