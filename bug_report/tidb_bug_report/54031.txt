Title: TiDB does not reject connection for mismatched user when using auth_socket plugin
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Create a new user with `auth_socket` plugin:

```mysql
CREATE USER 'u1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;
```

2. connect TiDB with MySQL client (my current system user is `wangchao`)

```
$ whoami
wangchao

$ mysql --comments -uu1 -S/tmp/tidb-4001.sock
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The connection should be rejected because the current system user and TiDB user are not the same:

```
$ mysql --comments -uu1 -S/tmp/tidb-4001.sock
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'u1'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
```

See [descriptions in MySQL doc](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/socket-pluggable-authentication.html#socket-pluggable-authentication-usage) :

> The socket plugin checks whether the socket user name (the operating system user name) matches the MySQL user name specified by the client program to the server. If the names do not match, the plugin checks whether the socket user name matches the name specified in the authentication_string column of the mysql.user system table row. If a match is found, the plugin permits the connection. 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

However, it succeed in TiDB

```
> whoami
wangchao
> mysql --comments -uu1 -S/tmp/tidb-4001.sock
