Title: row count is wrong when using v2 stats and there's only topn and not fully load stats
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
In `columnCountFromStorage()`:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/a45b3aaa2b1ac55bcce8d5a5d0018c9f56bc3f06/statistics/handle/handle.go#L1114-L1143
We return directly if `select sum(count) from mysql.stats_buckets` returns NULL.
It will return NULL if there aren't any buckets, but there may still exist topn, so we shouldn't return directly here.

### 2. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master
