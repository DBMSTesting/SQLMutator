Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
set tidb_enable_new_only_full_group_by_check = 1;
create table t01(c_state varchar(20));
select substr(c_state, 1, 1) from t01 group by substr(c_state, 1, 1) order by substr(c_state, 1, 1);
```
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
query success
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```sql
[15:18:35]TiDB root:test> select substr(c_state, 1, 1) from t01 group by substr(c_state, 1, 1) order by substr(c_state, 1, 1);
(1055, "Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'test.t01.c_state' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by")
[15:18:35]TiDB root:test>
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
```sql
[15:19:11]TiDB root:test> select tidb_version();
