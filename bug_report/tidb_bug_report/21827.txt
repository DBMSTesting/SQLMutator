Title: tidb-lighting does not log schema creation errors
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Create a MariaDB database containing a table having 700 columns. This number of columns exceeds the TiDB limit.
2. Use dumpling to create a dump of the database.
3. Use tidb-lightning to import the dump into a TiDB database.
4. Table creation fails, because the max number of columns is exceeded. Observe that this failure is not logged in the tidb-lightning log.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I would expect to see the table creation error logged in the tidb-lightning log.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Nothing.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
