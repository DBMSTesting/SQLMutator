Title: JSON string in multi-valued index should have `binary` collation
Description:
The json string in multi-valued index is written as `utf8mb4_bin` collation, which is different from the declaration in design doc:

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/42207/files#diff-f38d0335e6aecbe6435597ed53275c9ab73bf34f41c996b4ff1ed6e2be7bd12fR56
> For string types, the encoding result in TiDB is collation-aware, we could use `binary` collation for strings(in MySQL it is `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` and behaves almost the same as `binary`).

The good news is that the `GetType` returns `json`, so it also doesn't write `RestoreData` and the result is still correct :facepalm: .
