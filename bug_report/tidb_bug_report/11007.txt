Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```mysql
SELECT FIRST_VALUE(fieldA) RESPECT NULLS OVER (w1 PARTITION BY fieldB ORDER BY fieldB ASC, fieldA DESC ROWS 2 PRECEDING) AS 'first_value', fieldA, fieldB FROM ( SELECT `col_datetime_key` AS fieldA, `col_datetime` AS fieldB FROM `table50_int_autoinc` ) as t WINDOW w1 AS (PARTITION BY fieldB ORDER BY fieldB ASC, fieldA ASC );
```

2. What did you expect to see?

```mysql
ERROR 3581 (HY000) at line 1: A window which depends on another cannot define partitioning.
```

3. What did you see instead?

```mysql
ERROR 3583 (HY000) at line 1: Window '<unnamed window>' cannot inherit 'w1' since both contain an ORDER BY clause.
```


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
