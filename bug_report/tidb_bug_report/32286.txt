Title: "advanced" memory quota variables have no effect
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

set tidb_mem_quota_hashjoin=0;

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

This variable is "deprecated". A deprecated variable should still have some effect, especially since the documentation still claims that they have some effect: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/configure-memory-usage

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

These variables should be removed from the documentation if they have no effect.

The source code claims that these variables "do not take any effect anymore", and there's even a TODO to remove them in 4.1. This warning has been in the code for nearly 2 years. Maybe finally time to remove these entirely?

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
