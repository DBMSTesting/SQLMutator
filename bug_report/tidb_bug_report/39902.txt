Title: BATCH ON command only supports DELETE FROM
Description:
## Bug Report

`BATCH ON` command does not appear to function as described in docs.
https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/non-transactional-dml
https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/sql-statement-batch

Documentation states it should support DeleteFromStmt, UpdateStmt, InsertIntoStmt, ReplaceIntoStmt
However, only DeleteFromStmt appears to work.
All others report sql syntax error.


### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
From the documentation, this should work:
```
CREATE TABLE t(id int, v int, key(id));
CREATE TABLE t2(id int, v int, key(id));
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4);
BATCH ON test.t.id LIMIT 1 UPDATE t JOIN t2 ON t.id = t2.id SET t2.id = t2.id+1;
```
This last statement fails.

From doc: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/non-transactional-dml

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
batch command success

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your TiDB version for the right syntax to use line 1 column 98 near "UPDATE t JOIN t2 ON t.id = t2.id SET t2.id = t2.id+1

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
