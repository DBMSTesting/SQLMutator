Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Start a backup, and then inject some errors, (for example, make PD always provide stale information.), and begin backup.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The backup should fail at the "fine-grained backup" stage, and reporting some meaningful error message.

It reports "resolve lock timeout".

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v6.1.2, however all versions of BR may have this problem.
