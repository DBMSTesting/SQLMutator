Title: A transaction may be committed and TiDB doesn't return an undetermined error
Description:
## Bug Report

A region error doesn't mean a write request is failed:
* When TiKV is gracefully shutdown, it may return `StaleCommand` to all proposed requests(gRPC server is shutdown asynchronously): https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/4ed382c21699596a84aa3342b27e3221c0741893/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/apply.rs#L3006-L3010
* When a region is destroyed, it will return `RegionNotFound` to all proposed requests: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/4ed382c21699596a84aa3342b27e3221c0741893/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/apply.rs#L1132-L1144

Now TiDB sets undetermined errors only when encounters RPC errors. It's possible a transaction is committed and TiDB doesn't return an undetermined error. Fortunately, TiDB cleans up the primary lock first, so it doesn't break the atomicity of transaction.
