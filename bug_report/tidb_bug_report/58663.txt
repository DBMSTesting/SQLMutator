Title: br: sys table restore check omit the binf_info
Description:
In tidb master version, `mysql.bind_info` is added as a could be restored (https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/release-8.5/br/cmd/br/cmd.go#L40). 

But when check the sys table compatibility, it is omitted (https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/release-8.5/br/pkg/restore/snap_client/systable_restore.go#L48).

We need to check its compatibility in case of any schema change in the future.
