## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
As the title described, I set a null value as init data of a none exist column, and TIDB throw exception: ```runtime error: index out of range```

2. What did you expect to see?

Can set null as init data

3. What did you see instead?

Although it can set a not null value as init data, but could conflict with my expected which the same value in before.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
