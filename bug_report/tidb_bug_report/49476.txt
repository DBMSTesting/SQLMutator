Title: Unexpected Results of IN expression With NATURAL RIGHT JOIN
Description:
## Bug Report


### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 BOOLEAN);
INSERT INTO t0 (c0) VALUES (0);

SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0; -- 0
SELECT (false IN (t1.c0, t0.c0)) FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0; -- 1
SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0 WHERE (false IN (t1.c0, t0.c0));
-- Expected: 0
-- Actual: Empty set
```


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The third `SELECT` returns an empty set, which is surprising: If the result of second query is 1 (`TRUE`), the value of the `IN` expression should be `1`, and thus the third query should return `0`.

Not sure if the issue is related to https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/49108

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
