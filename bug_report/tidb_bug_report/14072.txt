1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
```
drop table t1;
create table t1 (a int,
                 b int generated always as (-a) virtual,
                 c int generated always as (-a) stored,
                 index (c));
insert into t1 (a) values (2), (1), (1), (3), (NULL);

select sum(c) from t1 group by b;
```

2. What did you expect to see?
```
mysql> select sum(c) from t1 group by b;
+--------+
| sum(c) |
+--------+
|     -2 |
|     -2 |
|     -3 |
|   NULL |
