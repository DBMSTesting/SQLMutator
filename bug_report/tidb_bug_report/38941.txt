Title: The gRPC log is output to the wrong file
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. Start TiDB with the following config:
```
[log.file]
max-size = 1
```

2. Enable TopSQL or set `GRPC_DEBUG` environment variable to let gRPC keep printing 
```
[ERROR] [grpclogger.go:116] ["[transport]transport: Got too many pings from the client, closing the connection."] [system=grpc] [grpc_log=true]"
[ERROR] [grpclogger.go:116] ["[transport]transport: loopyWriter.run returning. Err: transport: Connection closing"] [system=grpc] [grpc_log=true]
```

3. Add workload to cluster to populate the log file.
4. When the log file is rotated, gRPC error message should be output to the origin log file.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

New error messages from gRPC should be output to "tidb.log".

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

New error messages from gRPC are output to the rotated log file.
