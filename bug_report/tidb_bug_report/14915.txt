Title: Querying cluster table with aggregation panic
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

Executing such a SQL fails: `baseBuiltinFunc.evalDecimal() should never be called, please contact the TiDB team for help`.

```sql
select
	sum(exec_count*avg_mem)
	from performance_schema.cluster_events_statements_summary_by_digest_history
	where summary_begin_time='2020-02-22 3:00'
	and summary_end_time='2020-02-22 3:30'
	and table_names like 'mysql.%' or table_names like 'performance_schema.%'
	group by schema_name,digest,digest_text;
```
The reason is `sum(mul(int, int))` is wrong, `mul` returns `int` but `sum` expects `decimal`.
It should be `sum(cast(mul(int, int)))`.

Executing such a SQL sometimes fails: `other error: panic when RPC server handing coprocessor, stack:runtime error: index out of range [40] with length 16`
```sql
select sum(sum_latency)
 from cluster_events_statements_summary_by_digest_history
	where summary_begin_time='2020-02-22 3:00'
	and summary_end_time='2020-02-22 3:30'
        and table_names like 'mysql.%' or table_names like 'performance_schema.%'
	group by schema_name,digest,digest_text;
```

2. What did you expect to see?
They shouldn't return error.


3. What did you see instead?
They report errors.


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
master
