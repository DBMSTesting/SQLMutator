Title: enum&set column types should include string length in resultset
Description:
## Bug Report

TiDB does not set the "length" field in the reply packet to the client for enum and set column types. This can cause problems for clients that rely on that metadata. One such client is Hibernate, which is unable to consume enum (and presumably set) data from TiDB.

This issue was introduced via https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/7417 to address https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/6910.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Start the `mysql` client with the `--column-type-info` option.

```
create table t1 (id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key, e enum('a','b','c'));
insert into t1 (e) values ('a');
select e from t1;
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
Field   1:  `e`
Catalog:    `def`
Database:   `test`
Table:      `t1`
Org_table:  `t1`
Type:       STRING
Collation:  utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci (255)
Length:     4
Max_length: 1
Decimals:   0
Flags:      ENUM
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
Field   1:  `e`
Catalog:    `def`
Database:   `test`
Table:      `t1`
Org_table:  `t1`
Type:       STRING
Collation:  utf8mb4_bin (46)
Length:     0
Max_length: 1
Decimals:   0
Flags:      ENUM
```

Note that `Length` is 0 coming from TiDB, but it was 4 coming from MySQL.

### 4. Affected version (Required)

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->

v3.0, v4.0

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

<!-- should be filled by the investigator before it's closed -->
