Title: If a TTL job is cancelled, the `last_job_finish_time` is incorrect.
Description:
The first assert `intest.Assert(se.GetSessionVars().Location().String() == now.Location().String())` in `job.finish` is never true when `job.finish` is called from `rescheduleJobs`  (but our tests didn't cover it yet). It's because in `rescheduleJobs` the `now` is in `GlobalTimeZone` (`Asia/Shanghai` in my case), and the `se.GetSessionVars().Location().String()` is always `UTC`.

It'll not be a big issue as the job is scheduled according to the start time, but the wrong finish time is still confusing for users.
