### Issue

This PR  https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/32149 introduces CRLF as line separator and this PR introduces an option for line separator.
Seems they all forgot to update the size of the line separator here:
```
wp.currentFileSize += uint64(bf.Len()-lastBfSize) + 1 // 1 is for "\n"
```

I don't think it will impact the dumpling, but it is better to fix it, here is the PR:https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/54623
