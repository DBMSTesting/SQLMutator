## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
``` sql
CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `a` char(10) DEFAULT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `a` char(10) COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci DEFAULT NULL
);
insert into t values ("a");
insert into t1 values ("A");
select * from t where t.a  = all (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
select * from t where t.a  != any (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
select a as a_col from t where t.a <= all (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci from t1);
select a as a_col from t where t.a <= any (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci from t1);
select * from t where t.a  = (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

``` sql
mysql> select * from t where t.a  = all (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from t where t.a  != any (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select a as a_col from t where t.a <= all (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci from t1);
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select a as a_col from t where t.a <= any (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci from t1);
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from t where t.a  = (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
``` sql
mysql> select * from t where t.a  = all (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from t where t.a  != any (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select a as a_col from t where t.a <= all (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci from t1);
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select a as a_col from t where t.a <= any (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci from t1);
Empty set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from t where t.a  = (select a collate utf8mb4_general_ci  from t1);
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
