Title: The estimated rows of the where clause do not match expectations
Description:
## Bug Report

We found a problem when testing the where function of tidb. The only difference between the following two statements is that statement 1 does not contain a where clause, while statement 2 uses a where clause. We believe that the statement containing a where clause with a random predicate will be more restrictive than the statement with an empty where clause, so the estimated rows of the former will be less than the latter; However, when we use the explain function to view the estimated rows of the two statements, we find that the estimated rows containing the where clause are greater than the estimated rows without the where clause.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

USE test;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database2;
CREATE DATABASE database2;
USE database2;
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 FLOAT ZEROFILL DEFAULT 0.1283062654852083 );
UPDATE t0 SET c0=((t0.c0)REGEXP(true)) WHERE ((t0.c0) IS NULL);
ALTER TABLE t0 ADD PRIMARY KEY(c0);
UPDATE t0 SET c0=1 WHERE CAST(t0.c0 AS SIGNED);
ADMIN CHECKSUM TABLE t0;
ALTER TABLE t0  ORDER BY c0;
ALTER TABLE t0  DROP PRIMARY KEY;
REPLACE INTO t0 VALUES (0.1283062654852083), (0.1283062654852083);
UPDATE t0 SET c0=1094169305 WHERE t0.c0;
REPLACE INTO t0(c0) VALUES (0.45080037053271715);
ALTER TABLE t0  CHANGE c0 c0 FLOAT NOT NULL ;
SET @@sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';
ANALYZE TABLE t0;
--EXPLAIN SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING ((t0.c0)^(CAST(t0.c0 AS SIGNED))); --1
--EXPLAIN SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE 0.8113962746633389 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING ((t0.c0)^(CAST(t0.c0 AS SIGNED))); --3

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The estimated rows of statement 2 should be less than or equal to the estimated rows of statement 1

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The estimated rows of statement 2 are greater than  the estimated rows of statement 1

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
Release Version: v7.5.1
