Title: dml: load data can succeed with with wrong utf8 character
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
Amended case:
insert into t value( CAST(BINARY(X'c2c2c2c2') AS CHAR(2)));
ERROR 1406 (22001): Data too long for column 'a' at row 1

create table t(a varchar(2)/char(2))
load data local file 'xxxx' into table t     // file contains Binary(X'c2c2c2c2')
```

When we load data to a column of CHAR(2) of a existed table with data BINARY(X'c2c2c2c2'). It will succeed in
insertion ignoring the data-too-long error. (make it as warning)

Reason: Cast function will throw data-too-long error and return the truncated string equal to `X'c2c2'`, actually the 
returned truncated value is still invalid cause it contains the non-utf8 character.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
