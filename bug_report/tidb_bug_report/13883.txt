Title: Memory leak after executing large transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

I'm testing the large transaction code in the master branch.
I find that after executing a large transaction, there is still quite a lot of memory used by TiDB.
Even I close the connection, the memory can't be released.

2. What did you expect to see?

TiDB should release all the memory after a large transaction finish.

3. What did you see instead?

Memory leak.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
