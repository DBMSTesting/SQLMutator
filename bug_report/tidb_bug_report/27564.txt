## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
See https://github.com/pingcap/ticdc/issues/2612. This behavior of TiDB may result in strange event in TiCDC.

```sql
mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> create table t2 (id varchar(32) not null primary key, a int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> begin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> insert into t2 values (2,2);
Query OK, 1 row affected

mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> delete from t2 where id = 2;
Query OK, 1 row affected

mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
```bash
[10:59:42] youjiali1995:~ $ curl http://127.0.0.1:10080/mvcc/key/test/t2/1
{
 "key": "74800000000000004E5F728000000000000001",
 "region_id": 2,
 "value": {
  "info": {
   "writes": [
    {
     "type": 1,
     "start_ts": 427258114963668993,
     "commit_ts": 427258119341473794
    }
   ]
  }
 }
} 
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No delete record in write CF.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Only When deletes by the clustered primary key or unique index key in optimistic transactions, the delete record on such keys won't appear.
