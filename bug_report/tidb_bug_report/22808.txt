Title: Need to fix the document, or evict the global variables cache immediately
Description:
## Bug Report

refer to #14531 and #22806. While the behavior of this bug is expected, the documentation is problematic.

The description of this behavior is added by https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/pull/2208 and https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pull/1797, which describes that:

```
A single TiDB instance proactively gets the `GLOBAL` information and forms `gvc` (global variables cache) every 2 seconds.
```

But the document is modified to the misleading one in https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/pull/4001 and https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pull/3152.

```
Changes are also propagated to other TiDB servers every 2 seconds
```

All TiDB servers need to wait for changes to propagate, including the one you sent `SET GLOBAL xxxx`.

We either need to fix the document, or investigate if we can evict the GVC for the tidb-server you send `SET GLOBAL xxxx` immediately. I prefer the latter if it is possible to implement.
