Title: rule PredicatePushDown pushes wrong filter across projection
Description:
## Bug Report


### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 BOOL, c1 INT);
CREATE TABLE t1 LIKE t0;
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT IS_IPV4(t0.c1) FROM t0, t1;
INSERT INTO t0(c0, c1) VALUES (true, 0);
INSERT INTO t1(c0, c1) VALUES (true, 2);

SELECT v0.c0 FROM v0; -- {0}
SELECT (v0.c0)NOT LIKE(BINARY v0.c0) FROM v0; -- {0}
SELECT v0.c0 FROM v0 WHERE (v0.c0)NOT LIKE(BINARY v0.c0); -- {0}
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
` (v0.c0)NOT LIKE(BINARY v0.c0)` is evaluated to `FALSE` in the second `SELECT`, but the third `SELECT` still return non-empty results.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
