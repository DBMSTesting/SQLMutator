Title: plan: fix bug when outer join's condition is false
Description:
When the query is "select sum(-1) from t a left join t b on false", we rewirte it as "select sum(agg0) from t a join (select sum(-1) as agg0 from t where false) b". The table t will never return any record, but sum(-1) without group by will return NULL, which break our default values "-1". To avoid this bug, we should rewrite it to "select sum(agg0) from t a join (select sum(-1) as agg0 from t where false group by 1) b"
