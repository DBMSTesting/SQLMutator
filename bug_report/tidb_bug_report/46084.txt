Title: Incorrect variable to log size used in WriteToTiKV function
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

tidb/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go is incorrectly writing to the logs.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Found in the code and observable in logs.
Found in the code here: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/release-6.6/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1163
And here: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/release-6.6/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1179

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Total size listed in the logs, but instead it's logging the size of each batch (after resetting to 0) when calling the WriteToTiKV function. 
It should be writing the "totalSize" variable, but instead writes the "size" variable.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

This causes the function to write a 0 instead of the total size in the logs since "size" is set to 0 repeatedly during the functions execution.

Found in the code here: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/release-6.6/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1163
And here: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/release-6.6/br/pkg/lightning/backend/local/local.go#L1179

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

6.6.0
