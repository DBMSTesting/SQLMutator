Title: DDL job could not be consume in queue
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do?

Create DDL like drop table, create table, detail:

```drop table tidb_loader_voucher.checkpoint;```

2. What did you expect to see?

Drop table or create a table successfully.

3. What did you see instead?

I use go-sql-driver in my service when execute ```drop table tidb_loader_voucher.checkpoint;``` this print bellow error log:
```
level=info msg="remove checkpoint error: invalid connection\n" source="thanos.go:221"
[mysql] 2020/02/04 11:07:19 packets.go:36: unexpected EOF
```
- Then I check TiDB dashboard in DDL tab, it shows:

It sounds some DDL Job in the queue and never be executed.

- Then I use the admin command in mysql client:  ```admin show ddl jobs;```

Some job is being stuck. If I add more DDL statement it will never be executed because of that stuck.

- Then I try to kill job with id = 3467, this show bellow error:
```
> admin cancel ddl jobs 3467;
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| JOB_ID | RESULT                                                                   |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3467   | error: [admin:6]This job:3467 is almost finished, can't be cancelled now |
```

- Then, I execute this command:

```
> SHOW TABLES FROM tidb_loader_voucher;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
This indicates that the `checkpoint` table was deleted, but why the job didn't finish?

- According to this docs [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/design/2018-10-08-online-DDL.md), with this image:

I think something went wrong at step 7.

- Can you help me to solve this problem?

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

v3.0.1
