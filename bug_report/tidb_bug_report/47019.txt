Title: Unexpected Results by the hint USE_INDEX in TiFlash
Description:
## Bug Report

The query returns a different result under the hint `USE_INDEX`, which should not affect the result.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 CHAR, PRIMARY KEY(c0));
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('a');
ALTER TABLE t0 SET TIFLASH REPLICA 1;
set @@tidb_enforce_mpp=1;
SELECT SLEEP(5);

SELECT t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE LN(t0.c0); -- {a}
SELECT /*+ USE_INDEX(t0, i0, PRIMARY)*/t0.c0 FROM t0 WHERE LN(t0.c0); -- empty
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Two queries return the same result.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
