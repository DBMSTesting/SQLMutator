Title: Unexpected Result by BROADCAST_JOIN in TiFlash
Description:
## Bug Report

The query returns a different result under the hint `BROADCAST_JOIN`, which should not affect the result.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 CHAR, PRIMARY KEY(c0));
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 BOOL);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES ('a');
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (true);
ANALYZE TABLE t0;
ANALYZE TABLE t1;
ALTER TABLE t0 SET TIFLASH REPLICA 1;
ALTER TABLE t1 SET TIFLASH REPLICA 1;
SELECT SLEEP(5);

SELECT t1.c0 FROM t1, t0 WHERE LOG(t0.c0); -- empyt
SELECT /*+ BROADCAST_JOIN(t0, PRIMARY)*/t1.c0 FROM t1, t0 WHERE LOG(t0.c0); -- {1}
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Two queries return the same result.
