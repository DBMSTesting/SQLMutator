Title: The overhead of LocateRegionByID method in region cache is too much
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

TiCDC uses TiDB as a library, including the `LocateRegionByID` method in region cache. In a large region count scenario, we found the CPU overhead of `LocateRegionByID` is too much. ref: https://github.com/pingcap/ticdc/issues/1612#issuecomment-814004366

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

`LocateRegionByID` should be a O(1) or O(logN) operation, instead of an O(N).

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

`getRegionByIDFromCache` will search the whole region cache map
