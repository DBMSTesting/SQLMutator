Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 DECIMAL ZEROFILL UNIQUE , c1 BOOL ZEROFILL AS (-1));

sql1 return 255 while sql2 return 0

mysql> SELECT t0.c1 FROM t0;
+------+
| c1   |
+------+
|  255 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT t0.c1 FROM t0 WHERE (t0.c0 IS NULL);
