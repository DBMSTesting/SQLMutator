Title: Integer zerofill size attribute should not prevent type modification
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
create table t1 (t tinyint(4));
alter table t1 modify t tinyint(1);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No data loss can occur with this statement, and it does not cause any change to data storage format. The number in parentheses after an integer data type is just an advisory number used for "zerofill" in the client.

This issue can cause problems during migration if a customer exploits the equivalence between TINYINT and BOOLEAN. When a customer creates a BOOLEAN column, it's implicitly converted to TINYINT(1). Because the "arguments" to integer types are irrelevant, they may be omitted during certain operations, in which case TINYINT(1) can be converted to TINYINT(4). If a customer tries to execute an ALTER TABLE that modifies this column that was originally BOOLEAN (but is now TINYINT(4)) and treats it again as a BOOLEAN, they'll get an error.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql> create table t1 (t tinyint(4));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

mysql> alter table t1 modify t tinyint(1);
ERROR 8200 (HY000): Unsupported modify column: length 1 is less than origin 4
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
