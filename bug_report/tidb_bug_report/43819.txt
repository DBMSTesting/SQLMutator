### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. Execute the following sql
```sql
create database `partition_table`;
create table partition_table.t1 (a int primary key) PARTITION BY RANGE ( a ) ( PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (6),PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (11),PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (21), PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (30));

create database `partition_table2`;
create table partition_table2.t2 (a int primary key);

use `partition_table2`
ALTER TABLE partition_table.t1 EXCHANGE PARTITION p3 WITH TABLE t2;
```
2. Log the DDL job info

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Get the correct job info

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```json
{
  "id": 112,
  "type": 42,
  "schema_id": 106,
  "table_id": 108,
  "schema_name": "partition_table2",
  "table_name": "t1",
