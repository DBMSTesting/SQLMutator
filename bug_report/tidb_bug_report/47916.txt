Title: Later versions of DDL job usage may have compatibility issue.
Description:
## Enhancement
After https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/3993, we using `job.Version` like 
```
	if job.Version <= currentVersion {
		err = w.delRangeManager.addDelRangeJob(ctx, job)
	} else {
		err = dbterror.ErrInvalidDDLJobVersion.GenWithStackByArgs(job.Version, currentVersion)
	}
```
The code makes it hard to use a new version job. It may have an issue when upgrading with `modify column` or `drop index`(or other operations whose `jobNeedGC` is true).  We need to handle it.
