Title: TiDB and MySQL behave differently when multiply `EXISTS` result and a signed integer
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
select 
  ((exists (select 1)) * -5) as c1,
  (true * -5) as c2,
  ((0 in (0)) * -5) as c3
;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
mysql> select 
    ->   ((exists (select 1)) * -5) as c1,
    ->   (true * -5) as c2,
    ->   ((0 in (0)) * -5) as c3
    -> ;
+----+----+----+
| c1 | c2 | c3 |
+----+----+----+
| -5 | -5 | -5 |
+----+----+----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
mysql> select 
    ->   ((exists (select 1)) * -5) as c1,
    ->   (true * -5) as c2,
    ->   ((0 in (0)) * -5) as c3
    -> ;
+----------------------+----+----+
| c1                   | c2 | c3 |
+----------------------+----+----+
| 18446744073709551611 | -5 | -5 |
+----------------------+----+----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```


### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

### about us
We are the BASS team from the School of Cyber Science and Technology at Beihang University. Our main focus is on system software security, operating systems, and program analysis research, as well as the development of automated program testing frameworks for detecting software defects. Using our self-developed database vulnerability testing tool, we have identified the above-mentioned vulnerabilities in TiDB that may lead to database logic error.
