## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

There is a link in the footer for pingcap.com for "Quick Start" (under Docs). It links to:
https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/how-to/deploy/orchestrated/docker/

Which has a strong warning saying DO NOT USE in production.

### 2. What did you expect to see?

Quickstart should link to TIUP instead. It looks like this link is just out of date.

### 3. What did you see instead?

Docs bug

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

Docs bug
