### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
I use ./pd-ctl -u http://XXXX:22379 store limit all 20 command to update the store limitation. 
But after I restart the pd leader, the store limit change to the default value 15.
More details as following 
[root@r10 bin]# ./pd-ctl -u http://r11:22379 store limit
{
 "1": {
 "add-peer": 15,
 "remove-peer": 15
 },
 "4": {
 "add-peer": 15,
 "remove-peer": 15
 },
 "5": {
 "add-peer": 15,
 "remove-peer": 15
 }
}

[root@r10 bin]# ./pd-ctl -u http://r11:22379 store limit all 20
Success!
