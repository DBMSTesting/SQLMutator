Title: domain: check schema change when lease=0
Description:
When lease = 0, schemaValidator will always return true, which means commit won't check schema.
This introduce a bug that insert into table will success even the column is deleted by another transaction.
Localstore is affected by this bug, because its lease is 0.

Depends on another PR https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/3270 to pass CI.
