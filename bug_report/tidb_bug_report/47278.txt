Title: The compression ratio of TiDB is much worse than MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. Use zlib compression to connect to TiDB with MySQL client or JDBC.
2. Send a 16M SQL to TiDB and TiDB returns a 16M result, e.g. `select 'aaaaaaaaa....'`.
3. Check the compressed data received and sent by TiDB.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The compressed data from client to TiDB is about 16K, and the data from TiDB to client should be also around 16K.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The data from TiDB to client is surprisingly up to 2M.

About zstd default level: the compression ratio is also worse than MySQL, but the gap is not as huge as zlib.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
