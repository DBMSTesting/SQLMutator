### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

if we inject some error in function `onRecoverTable` before `updateVersionAndTableInfo`
```go
failpoint.Inject("recoverTableMockError", func(val failpoint.Value) {
	if val.(bool) {
		failpoint.Return(ver, errors.New("recoverTableMockError"))
	}
})
```

we are expected to get error `recoverTableMockError`, but actually it will return `ErrInvalidDDLState`
