Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```sql
mysql> create table t1(id int primary key) partition by hash(id) partitions 2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> alter table t1 alter partition p1 alter placement policy constraints='{"+zone=bj,+zone=sh":2,"-zone=gz":1}' role=follower;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

It should not report an error, as `alter` is transformed to `add` and it's legal to add 3 followers.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
