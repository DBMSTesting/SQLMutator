Title: Weird SELECT view when a record is modified to the same value by two transactions
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
/* init */ create table t(a int, b int);
/* init */ insert into t values (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2);

/* s1 */ begin;
/* s1 */ select * from t; -- [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
/* s2 */ begin;
/* s2 */ update t set a = 10 where b = 1;
/* s2 */ commit;
/* s1 */ select * from t; -- [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
/* s1 */ update t set a = 10 where true;
/* s1 */ select * from t;  -- [(10, 0), (1, 1), (10, 2)]
/* s1 */ commit;
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The result of final SELECT should be `(10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 2)`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The result of final SELECT is `(10, 0), (1, 1), (10, 2)`.

I think it is so weird for session 1 to see the second row is still `(1, 1)` after the successful execution of an `UPDATE` with the `WHERE TRUE` predicate. 

So I think it will be better for s1 to see all records it updates regardless of whether the values before and after the UPDATE are the same.


### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```
+--------------------+
| version()          |
+--------------------+
| 5.7.25-TiDB-v5.2.1 |
+--------------------+
```
