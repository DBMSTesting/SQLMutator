Title: Cancel ADD INDEX job with DXF is slow
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. enable `tidb_ddl_enable_fast_reorg` and `tidb_enable_dist_task`
2. set `tidb_ddl_reorg_max_write_speed` (introduced in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/57145) to a small speed like `1kb`
3. add index in session 1, which would cost some time
4. cancel the add index job in session 2

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The job can be canceled in time

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

It takes much time for the job state to transfer from 'canceling' to 'rollback done'

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
