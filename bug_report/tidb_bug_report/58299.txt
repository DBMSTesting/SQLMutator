Description:
## Bug Report

Some functions like `TIDB_VERSION()` are allowed in generated columns, while they should have been blocked.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(id int auto_increment primary key, c1 varchar(255) as (version()));
CREATE TABLE t1(id int auto_increment primary key, c1 varchar(255) as (tidb_version()));
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Error 3102 for both statements.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql-8.0.11-TiDB-v8.4.0> CREATE TABLE t1(id int auto_increment primary key, c1 varchar(255) as (version()));
ERROR 3102 (HY000): Expression of generated column 'c1' contains a disallowed function.
mysql-8.0.11-TiDB-v8.4.0> CREATE TABLE t1(id int auto_increment primary key, c1 varchar(255) as (tidb_version()));
