Title: Query using index has a duplicated result.
Description:
## Bug Report

We have 2 TiDB clusters, one master and one slave. Data replicated from master to slave by TiDB-binlog.
When query by index on the slave, the result has a duplicated row, but the result is corrected when executing the same query on master.

Currently, the bug only affected one record, no other duplicate record found so far.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Table schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `log` (
  `field_1` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_2` smallint(6) NOT NULL,
  `field_3` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_4` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `field_5` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `field_6` smallint(6) NOT NULL,
  `field_7` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `field_8` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `field_9` varchar(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT '-1',
  `field_10` smallint(1) NOT NULL,
  `field_11` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `field_12` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `field_13` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_14` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_15` json NOT NULL,
  `field_16` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_17` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_18` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_19` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_20` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `field_21` varchar(1024) NOT NULL,
  `field_22` varchar(1024) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`field_1`,`field_2`,`field_3`),
  KEY `key_1` (`field_7`,`field_11`),
  KEY `key_2` (`field_20`),
  KEY `key_3` (`field_14`),
  KEY `key_4` (`field_8`),
  KEY `key_5` (`field_3`,`field_19`),
  KEY `key_6` (`field_5`,`field_4`,`field_12`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin;
```

1.   Query by index (key_1, key_2, key_3, key_4) has the incorrect result (which has a duplicate row). Other index (which has less unique value) is not verify due to large of data.
```sql
select field_1, field_2, field_3 from log where field_7='PU210610000124334';
select field_1, field_2, field_3 from log where field_20=1623269827689;
select field_1, field_2, field_3 from log where field_14=1623269827689;
select field_1, field_2, field_3 from log where field_8='210610000124334';
```
- The result is the same for 4 queries above:

- The explain analyze:
```sql

explain analyze select field_1, field_2, field_3 from log where field_14=1623269827689; -- field_20 has the same result.

```

2. Query by the first field on the compose primary key. The result is corrected
```sql
select field_1, field_2, field_3 from log where field_1=100122019622518784;
```
- The result:

```
