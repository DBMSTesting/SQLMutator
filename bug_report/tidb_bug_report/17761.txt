Title: P2-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-Fetching from a view with an escaped backslash results in an unexpected syntax error
Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#63

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT '\\';
SELECT * FROM v0; -- ERROR 1105 (HY000): line 1 column 10 near "'\'"
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` results in a syntax error:
```

```
I found this issue based on commit c00384f77788102752f56c609156d451d0ea2426 and can also reproduce it on the 4.0 RC.

This bug seems related to https://github.com/tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue/issues/53, where a backslash in a generated column results in an error.
