3. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
A complete runnable program is good.

```
drop table if exists t1, t2, t3;
create table t1 (a int NOT NULL, b int NOT NULL, key(a));
insert into t1 values 
  (0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9);
create table t2 (a int NOT NULL, b int NOT NULL, key(a));
insert into t2 select * from t1;
update t2 set b=1;
create table t3 (a int, oref int);
insert into t3 values (1, 1), (NULL,1), (NULL,0);
select a, oref, 
       t3.a in (select t1.a from t1, t2 where t1.b=t2.a and t2.b=t3.oref) Z 
from t3;
drop table t1, t2, t3;
```

4. What did you expect to see?


5. What did you see instead?
TiDB returned the correct result, but got a panic and crashed after it.
