Title: lightning panic when table name in source file and target cluster is different 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
provide following source file:
```
cat test.T.0.sql
insert into T values (1);
```

manually create target table in target cluster:
```
create table test.t(id int);
```

run tidb-lightning with this source file.

The root cause is:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/ab30467384b7f18f1c2af2e34f37cf00f20f2d54/br/pkg/lightning/restore/tidb.go#L257-L279

We should also check if other logic has similar issue.

The tableName should use `tbl.Name` instead of `tblInfo.Name.O` as they may be different if target table is manually create and is different from tbl.Name.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
tidb-lightning should import successfully since tidb is case-insensitive

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
