Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
We really don't need a bust to prevent in lightning as it always send in batches. It might cause unnecessary throttle. 
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
More even distribution of network traffic across tikvs
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
I am seeing uneven distribution of traffic sometimes. But i don't have clear evidence point to this issue. However, i think it is a good fix to have. We already have it in prod.

6.5
