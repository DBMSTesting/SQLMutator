Title: The Location in the DDL job is empty after decoding.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Because the `Job.Location` object's fields are all lowercase, there are no useful fields after json decoding.
```
	job := &Job{
...
		ReorgMeta: &DDLReorgMeta{
			Location: time.Now().In(time.UTC).Location(),
		},
	}

job.Encode(false)
newJob := &Job{}
err = newJob.Decode(b)
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Hopefully, it has data in`newJob.ReorgMeta.Location`.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

No data.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
