Title: TiDB may get bootstrap failed when stats initialization is concurrent and TiDB cpu core number is big
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

If we set `concurrently-init-stats = true` in config and the TiDB node has a lot CPU cores and the table num is also big.
We may hit the write throttle threshold of the [ristretto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto) cache we are using.

And causing unexpected problems such TiDB crashed due to the concurrent map read&write
