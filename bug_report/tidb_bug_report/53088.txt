### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT false )PARTITION BY HASH(c0) PARTITIONS 10;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT (('k')|(((t0.c0)AND(t0.c0)))) FROM t0 GROUP BY FROM_BASE64(NULL);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v1(c0) AS SELECT (('k')|(((t0.c0)AND(t0.c0)))) FROM t0 GROUP BY FROM_BASE64(NULL);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (true) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c0=((t0.c0)|('-'));
INSERT HIGH_PRIORITY IGNORE  INTO t0 VALUES (true);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (false), (false), (true) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c0=t0.c0;

set @@tidb_build_stats_concurrency=10;
select * from v0;
select * from v1;
