Title: txn: unexpected high frequency gc
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Enable https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/etc/config-template.toml#L1206 with TiDB v6.5.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The GC resolve lock frequency is the same as the previous versions, the related request number will not surge.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The kv scan lock requests surge after upgrading to release v6.5.0.
After enabling https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/etc/config-template.toml#L1206 with TiDB v6.5.
In a GC interval, several time resolve locks would be triggered.

2023-01-21 15:51:57 | [2023/01/21 07:51:57.167 +00:00] [INFO] [gc_worker.go:1073] ["[gc worker] start resolve locks"]

```
This is because after enabling the `log-backup` option, the resolve locks would be triggered though the GC interval is not reached yet, the code is https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/store/gcworker/gc_worker.go#L324-L335.



### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v6.5.0
