Title: Logical bug: value changed after adding DISTINCT [v6.2.0, v6.4.0]
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
drop table if exists t;
CREATE TABLE t (c1 int);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1);

SELECT 1%`f1` FROM (SELECT DAYNAME('2010-07-20') AS `f1` FROM t WHERE DATE_ADD(TIMEDIFF('2000-08-04 02:09:39', '2002-08-11 22:00:35'), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) NOT IN (1)) AS `t2`;
SELECT 1%`f1` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT DAYNAME('2010-07-20') AS `f1` FROM t WHERE DATE_ADD(TIMEDIFF('2000-08-04 02:09:39', '2002-08-11 22:00:35'), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) NOT IN (1)) AS `t2`;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

In theory, the result of sql2(DISTINCT) âŠ† the result of sql1:

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

However, the value 0 changed to NULL after adding DISTINCT, seems like a logical bug:

```sql
mysql> select version();
+--------------------+
| version()          |
+--------------------+
| 5.7.25-TiDB-v6.4.0 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1%`f1` FROM (SELECT DAYNAME('2010-07-20') AS `f1` FROM t WHERE DATE_ADD(TIMEDIFF('2000-08-04 02:09:39', '2002-08-11 22:00:35'), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) NOT IN (1)) AS `t2`;
+--------+
| 1%`f1` |
+--------+
|      0 |
+--------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

### 5. Hope these can be helpful for your debugging:

We look for the first version of the bug in all docker images (with format x.x.x) of https://hub.docker.com/r/pingcap/tidb/tags 
We found that the bug first occurred in pingcap/tidb:v6.2.0, it cannot be reproduced in pingcap/tidb:v6.1.3 (we can't find more intermediate versions in dockerhub):
