Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1M table in the cluster already, run 'create table' workload together with a "SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = xxx' workload.


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

DDL should be fast enough.


### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

DDL is slow, and the LoadSchemaDiff takes a long time.
