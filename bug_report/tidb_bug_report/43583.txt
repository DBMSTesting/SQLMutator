Title: tidb_load_based_replica_read_threshold may violate linearizability in point get scenario
Description:
## Bug Report

`tidb_load_based_replica_read_threshold` allows tidb to read on follower when leader is busy.
It may violate linearizability in point get scenario as the diagram shows.

A writes k to 9, B is concurrent to A and reads 9 on follower, C is concurrent to A and happens
after B but reads 8. It is possible when follower applies faster than leader.

```
  k = 8
  -------------------------> time
A    ---------------
     w(k, 9)

B     ----
      r(k) = 9 on follower

C            ----
             r(k) = 8 on leader
```

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Run Jepsen tests and inject some errors that cause TiKV busy.
It hard to reproduce in real world though.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Does not violate linearizability.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

May violate linearizability.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v7.1.0
