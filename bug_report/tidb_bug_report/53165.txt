Title: multi-schema-change fast reorg has no chance to save checkpoint
Description:
We use `FlushModeAuto` to save checkpoint https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/dded4ea769b0d3058a626c52b5bfb6ace5fa7690/pkg/ddl/ingest/checkpoint.go#L199

But when `indexIDs` has more than one elements, each index (engine) check flush based on shared last flush time and will update the time immediately https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/dded4ea769b0d3058a626c52b5bfb6ace5fa7690/pkg/ddl/ingest/backend.go#L287-L288

It's unlikely that all engines are flushed 
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/dded4ea769b0d3058a626c52b5bfb6ace5fa7690/pkg/ddl/ingest/flush.go#L18-L31 so at caller checkpoint is not updated.
