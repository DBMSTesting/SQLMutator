Title: plan: adjust cost factor to make right agg plan.
Description:
Consider query: 
> select sum(a.b), sum(b.b) from t a join t b on a.c = b.c group by a.d order by a.d

We got the plan LeftHashJoin{Table(t)->Table(t)}(a.c,b.c)->Sort->StreamAgg->Trim
Instead, we should get LeftHashJoin{Table(t)->Table(t)}(a.c,b.c)->HashAgg->Sort->Trim.
Obviously we calculate wrong cost, in Sort operator we use "c*log(c)*cpu_factor" to calcuate sort cost.
But in enforce function we use "c*cpu_factor" to calculate sort cost. We should adopt a uniform formula to calcuate.
