Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

```
CREATE TABLE t1 (N int, M tinyint);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,0),(3,0);
PREPARE stmt FROM 'UPDATE t1 AS P1 INNER JOIN (SELECT N FROM t1 GROUP BY N HAVING COUNT(M) > 1) AS P2 ON P1.N = P2.N SET P1.M = 2';
EXECUTE stmt;
```

2. What did you expect to see?

executed successfully

3. What did you see instead?

Error returned: `Table 'test.P1' doesn't exist`

Note that the `UPDATE` can be executed successfully if we don't use prepare.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
