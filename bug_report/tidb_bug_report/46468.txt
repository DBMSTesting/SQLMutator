          selector: "tidb(ddl-owner)_to_tikv(random)"
          period: "@every 5m"
          faultDuration: 5m
          faultTotalRunTime: 30m
7、add index task rollback to txn-merge when network_latency of pdleader
        - name: "ha_pdleader_to_all_network_latency(latency:50ms)"
          warmUpTime: 5m
          faultType: network_latency(latency:50ms)
          selector: "pdleader_to_all"
          period: "@every 5m"
          faultDuration: 5m
          faultTotalRunTime: 30m
8、add index task rollback to txn-merge when network_latency of one of tikv
        - name: "ha_tikv(random)_to_all_network_latency(latency:50ms)"
          warmUpTime: 5m
          faultType: network_latency(latency:50ms)
          selector: "tikv(random)_to_all"

          faultDuration: 5m
          faultTotalRunTime: 30m
9、add index task rollback to txn-merge when network_latency of one of ddl owner
        - name: "ha_tidb(ddl-owner)_to_all_network_latency(latency:50ms)"
          warmUpTime: 5m
