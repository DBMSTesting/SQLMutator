Title: Support tidb_allow_auto_random_explicit_insert as a global variable
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
mysql> set global allow_auto_random_explicit_insert=on;
```

```
ERROR 1105 (HY000): Variable 'allow_auto_random_explicit_insert' is a SESSION variable and can't be used with SET GLOBAL
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

It should be possible to set allow_auto_random_explicit_insert as a global variable. The rationale for disallowing this in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/17102#issuecomment-627177465 was that a global variable couldn't meet the need of some specific use case, but the rationale was flawed. A variable that can be set globally can also be set on a per-session basis.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. Affected version (Required)

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->

v4.0.3

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

<!-- should be filled by the investigator before it's closed -->
