Title: txn: memory of previous execution can not be released when retrying a transaction
Description:
## Enhancement
When retrying a transaction, for example, when we meet lock-conflict error, the memory of the previous execution can not be released until the txn commits successfully. It may cause conflict txn killed by tidb_mem_quota_query or make TiDB OOM

This issue was fix in https://github.com/tikv/client-go/pull/1451 since v8.4.0, while  I think we need PR to fix it in lower versions.
