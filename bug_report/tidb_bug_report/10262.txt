### What problem does this PR solve? <!--add issue link with summary if exists-->
Support read the historical statistics for `show stats_X` when `tidb_snapshot` is set.

Note:
This commit can *ONLY* fix the history read problem when we try to query the statistics manually, other 2 individual problems need to be fixed when we set `tidb_snapshot`:

1. When we dump stats using http-api, the data is the latest.
2. When we execute normal select_stmt, the statistics used is the latest. 

### What is changed and how it works?
Read from kv instead of the memory buffer when tidb_snapshot is set.
