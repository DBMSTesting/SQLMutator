Title: Reading from information_schema.table fails while DDL is being performed
Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?

In 15 parallel threads, I performed DDL in a loop (15 different schemas):
```
#!/bin/sh
DATABASE=$1
for i in `seq 1 1000000`; do
  mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 $DATABASE -e "CREATE TABLE t$i (a int primary key not null auto_increment);";
done;
```
I then queried `information_schema.tables`. 

2. What did you expect to see?

I expected it to be slow, or have to wait on a lock.

3. What did you see instead?

I received an error, which makes me think it is inconsistently reading the metadata:

```
mysql> select count(*) from information_schema.tables;
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'db11.t1414' doesn't exist
mysql> select count(*) from information_schema.tables;
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'db12.t1413' doesn't exist
mysql> explain select count(*) from information_schema.tables;

2 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select *  from information_schema.tables;
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'db12.t1416' doesn't exist
mysql> select *  from information_schema.tables limit 10;
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'db10.t1430' doesn't exist
```
After I stop my 15 threads, the query runs as expected:
```
mysql> select count(*)  from information_schema.tables;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    27611 |
+----------+
1 row in set (43.22 sec)
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
```
mysql> select tidb_version()\G
