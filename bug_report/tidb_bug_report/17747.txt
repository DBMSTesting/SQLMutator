Description:
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#81

---


### 1. What did you do?
deploy v4.0.0-rc cluster with PD,TiDB and TiKV. After that scale-out the cluster with scale-out.yaml to have tiflash.  When try to upgrade the whole cluster to rc2, tiflash failed and status shows down,i got errors : "failed to restart tiflash".
Also i got below error in logs "2020.05.19 10:55:40.260944 [ 1 ] <Error> Application: DB::Exception: Path "/data/tiflash/data//data/gamelive/gamelive.gamelive_jiaoyou_active_sb/" is missing.
2020.05.19 10:55:55.576276 [ 1 ] <Warning> IDAsPathUpgrader: Can not remove database meta file: /data/tiflash/data//metadata/db_1.sql"  (something wrong with the path, but the yaml file is fine)

### 2. What did you expect to see?
i expect to have upgradation successful.

### 3. What did you see instead?
i got the errors above.
### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
