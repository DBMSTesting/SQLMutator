Title: The value of column double shows incorrect precision
Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!
1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
We found that the field type is double, and the inserted data display error is not accurate to the decimal point.
For example:
```
mysql> CREATE TABLE `tab3` (
    ->   `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
    ->   `mn4` double(4,2) DEFAULT '11.11',
    ->   PRIMARY KEY (`id`) /*T![clustered_index] CLUSTERED */
    -> ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.14 sec)


mysql> insert into sbtest.tab3 values(1,10);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from sbtest.tab3;
+----+-----+
| id | mn4 |
+----+-----+
|  1 |  10 |
+----+-----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Same behavior as mysql
```
mysql> select * from sbtest.tab3;
+----+-------+
| id | mn4   |
+----+-------+
|  1 | 10.00 |
+----+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
mysql> select * from sbtest.tab3;
+----+-----+
| id | mn4 |
+----+-----+
|  1 |  10 |
+----+-----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
