Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.


```mysql
SELECT  `col_float_signed` AS field1  FROM `table50_int_autoinc` GROUP BY GET_FORMAT( DATETIME, 'ISO' );
```

2. What did you expect to see?

```
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'randgen_test.table50_int_autoinc.col_float_signed' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

3. What did you see instead?

The column information is missing.
```
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column '' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```
