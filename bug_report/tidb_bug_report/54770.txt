Title: runaway: change `RUNAWAY_WATCHES` time type to UTC
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Currently `tidb_runaway_watch` relies on struct `QuarantineRecord` to store time as UTC, while `RUNAWAY_WATCHES` directly selects `tidb_runaway_watch` to convert to local time.

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM mysql.tidb_runaway_watch limit 1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                 id: 1
resource_group_name: default
         start_time: 2024-07-16 07:34:14.137009
           end_time: 2024-07-16 07:44:14.137009
              watch: 1
         watch_text: select  count(*) from orders where o_orderdate = '1994-11-12'
             source: 127.0.0.1:4000
             action: 3
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RUNAWAY_WATCHES where id =1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                 ID: 1
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: default
         START_TIME: 2024-07-16 15:34:14
           END_TIME: 2024-07-16 15:44:14
              WATCH: Exact
         WATCH_TEXT: select  count(*) from orders where o_orderdate = '1994-11-12'
             SOURCE: 127.0.0.1:4000
             ACTION: Kill
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master
