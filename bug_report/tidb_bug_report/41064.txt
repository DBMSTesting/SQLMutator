```
with ssci as (
select ss_customer_sk customer_sk
      ,ss_item_sk item_sk
from store_sales,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212 + 11
group by ss_customer_sk

where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212 + 11
group by cs_bill_customer_sk
        ,cs_item_sk)

                               and ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk)
UNION
 select  sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) store_only
      ,sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) catalog_only
