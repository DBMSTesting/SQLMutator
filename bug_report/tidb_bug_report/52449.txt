Title: The error in `groupConcatOrder/topNRows` cannot be accessed from outside
Description:
The only assignment to the `(topNRows).err` is:

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/6a35d5e5078c374e122b47735527f408e6ccb8b3/pkg/executor/aggfuncs/func_group_concat.go#L323-L330

However, the `topNRows` is not a reference receiver, assigning to `h.err` is meaningless. The `err` here is actually not returned outside.

This issue exists from the very beginning https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16591
