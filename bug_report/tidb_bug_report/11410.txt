Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
create table a(id int);
create table b(id int);
drop table a,b;

2. What did you expect to see?
receive two ddl binlog, one is `drop table a`, one is `drop table b`


3. What did you see instead?
receive two ddl binlog, both ddl_query is `drop table a, b`

in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/f8912049f52e94d2ec09001395f7f491630d5c29/executor/ddl.go#L247
it will run one ddl job for one table, but the ddl_query is the origin query `drop table a,b`


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
