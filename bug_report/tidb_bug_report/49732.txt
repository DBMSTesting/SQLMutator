Title: STATEMENTS_SUMMARY evict strategy can lead to strange results
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Change system variable for observe:

```sql
set @@global.tidb_stmt_summary_refresh_interval=60;
```

Run following query in a loop:

```sql
select * from t1;
select * from t2;
select * from t3;
select * from t4;
```

When there are no evict occurred, the `SQL Statements` result show in TiDB dashboard is expected,:

But after `set @@global.tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count=8;`, the query result will be wired:

This is caused by the evict strategies, some SQL statements are been evicted by new query(such as `select version()`, even the query only occure once) , and then been recorded when they were reoccur.  Maybe we need a better evict strategy to avoid this problem.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
