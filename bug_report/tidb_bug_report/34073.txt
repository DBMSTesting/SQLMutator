Title: Query Plan too large may cause query SLOW_QUERY faild
Description:
## Problem

Since slow log store the original plan and doesn't trim even the plan is very large, then the user query `SLOW_QUERY` or `CLUSTER_SLOW_QUERY` maybe failed cause by the query memory usage more than `mem-quota-query`, then the query will be killed by TiDB.

As I known, the biggest query plan after decodePlan, the size is more than `4GB`, already bigger than the default value of `mem-quota-query` `1GB`
