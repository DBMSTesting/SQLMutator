Title: Wrong Result in TiKV on Right Join
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 NUMERIC ZEROFILL);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 NUMERIC UNSIGNED);
INSERT IGNORE INTO t0 VALUES (-1234);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL);
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0 WHERE ((1^(t0.c0 AND NULL)) <> (t1.c0 IS NOT NULL));
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I find that tikv show different behavior with MySQL

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
// MySQL 8.4.1
MySQL [test]> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0 WHERE ((1^(t0.c0 AND NULL)) <> (t1.c0 IS NOT NULL));
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        1 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

// TiDB
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t0 WHERE ((1^(t0.c0 AND NULL)) <> (t1.c0 IS NOT NULL));
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

TiDB v8.5.0
