Title: multiple instances of tidb-server may use the same temporary directory
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

Multiple instances of tidb-server may use the same temporary directy.
See https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/0e0faeeb30c340e3dc091aaba01c336427a38f3c/util/chunk/disk.go#L47, if two of `tidb-server`s have same instance name but in different directory, each of them will share the same folder and the next start of one instance will  remove this directory so that another instance may face unexpected problem.

2. What did you expect to see?

- different instances in on node use different directories.
- if one tidb-server uses a temporary directory which another is in use, it should panic.
- When tidb-server starts, find a way to safely remove the temporary directory created when it last starts.
- We need ensure that `tidb-server` instance has the READ/WRITE privilege for the directory, otherwise, panic when starts up.

3. What did you see instead?



4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

4.0.0-alpha
