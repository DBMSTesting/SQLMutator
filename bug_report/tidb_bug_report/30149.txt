Title: dumpling: dump failed when a sequence created
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
tidb> use test;
tidb> create sequence seq;

./dumpling -h host -u test_user -p test_password -P 4000 --filetype sql --threads 32 -o .

```

return dump failed. Since many people do not know what seq is, and error info is `Error 1051: Unknown table ''`, it will make them confused and worried.


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
dump successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
dump failed: sql: SELECT * FROM `test`.`seq` LIMIT 1: Error 1051: Unknown table ''
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
