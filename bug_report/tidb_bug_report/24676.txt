Title: columns that match group by expr should not trigger only-full-group-by-error
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  `c1` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'
);

SELECT c1 FROM t1 GROUP BY c1 ORDER BY c1 ASC; -- legal (obviously)
SELECT ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) AS `c1` FROM `t1` GROUP BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ORDER BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ASC; -- legal
SELECT ((floor(((`c1` - 10) / 300)) * 50000) + 0.0) AS `c1` FROM `t1` GROUP BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ORDER BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ASC; -- illegal
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

If a column in the FROM list matches the GROUP BY expression exactly, and all functions specified are deterministic, then there is no violation of only-full-group-by. Here is the result from MySQL 8.0.24:

```sql
mysql [localhost:8024] {msandbox} (test) > SELECT c1 FROM t1 GROUP BY c1 ORDER BY c1 ASC; -- legal (obviously)
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql [localhost:8024] {msandbox} (test) > SELECT ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) AS `c1` FROM `t1` GROUP BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ORDER BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ASC; -- legal
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql [localhost:8024] {msandbox} (test) > SELECT ((floor(((`c1` - 10) / 300)) * 50000) + 0.0) AS `c1` FROM `t1` GROUP BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ORDER BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ASC; -- illegal
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'test.t1.c1' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) AS `c1` FROM `t1` GROUP BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ORDER BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ASC; -- legal
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of ORDER BY is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column '' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
mysql> SELECT ((floor(((`c1` - 10) / 300)) * 50000) + 0.0) AS `c1` FROM `t1` GROUP BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ORDER BY ((floor(((`c1` - 0.0) / 50000)) * 50000) + 0.0) ASC; -- illegal
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of ORDER BY is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column '' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```


### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```sql
