Title: Column alias is not propagated to subquery
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

This is related to #26945 which was resolved in #33640 but is about column aliases.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1, t2;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT, b INT);
CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT, b INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 1);

-- does not work (but works in mysql, and is similar to what hibernate generates)
SELECT one.a, one.b as b2 FROM t1 one ORDER BY (SELECT two.b FROM t2 two WHERE two.a = one.b);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```sql
+------+
| a    |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'one.b' in 'where clause'
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

```
