Title: Flaky test: TestShowGrantsForCurrentUserUsingRole
Description:
## Enhancement

The test [`TestShowGrantsForCurrentUserUsingRole`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/privilege/privileges/privileges_test.go#L2250) is flaky. I was trying to run all the unit tests in the repo and noticed the `TestShowGrantsForCurrentUserUsingRole` test fail like this -

```bash
=== CONT  TestShowGrantsForCurrentUserUsingRole
    result.go:49: 
        	Error Trace:	result.go:49
        	            				privileges_test.go:2286
        	Error:      	Not equal: 
        	            	expected: "[GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT UPDATE ON role.* TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT SELECT ON test.* TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT DELETE ON mysql.user TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT 'admins'@'%', 'engineering'@'%', 'otherrole'@'%' TO 'joe'@'%']\n"
        	            	actual  : "[GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT SELECT ON test.* TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT UPDATE ON role.* TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT DELETE ON mysql.user TO 'joe'@'%']\n[GRANT 'admins'@'%', 'engineering'@'%', 'otherrole'@'%' TO 'joe'@'%']\n"
        	            	
        	            	Diff:

        	            	+[GRANT SELECT ON test.* TO 'joe'@'%']
        	            	 [GRANT UPDATE ON role.* TO 'joe'@'%']
        	            	-[GRANT SELECT ON test.* TO 'joe'@'%']
        	            	 [GRANT DELETE ON mysql.user TO 'joe'@'%']
        	Test:       	TestShowGrantsForCurrentUserUsingRole
        	Messages:   	sql:SHOW GRANTS FOR current_user() USING otherrole;, args:[]
```

But later while running the same test standalone to check the error properly (as the full unit test log was too long and I didn't search for TestShowGrantsForCurrentUserUsingRole properly) the test passed

Looks like it's a case of a flaky test where the ordering of a query's result rows are causing the test to fail at times. In the above error it shows that `[GRANT SELECT ON test.* TO 'joe'@'%']` came prior to `GRANT UPDATE ON role.* TO 'joe'@'%']` but the expected was for it to come later

Does ordering of the query results matter in this case? I was assuming it doesn't but I don't know for sure. But if query result row order doesn't matter, we can write the test in such a way that order is ignored as part of the assertion

Let me know what you folks think!
