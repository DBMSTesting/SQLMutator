Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
create table t1 (id int, bench_type varchar(10),version varchar(10),tps int(20));   
insert into t1 (id,bench_type,version,tps) values (1,'sysbench','5.4.0',1111111);
insert into t1 (id,bench_type,version,tps) values (2,'sysbench','6.0.0',222222);


with all_data as
(select * from t1
),version1 as (select * from all_data where version ='5.4.0'
),version2 as(select * from all_data where version ='6.0.0')
select v1.tps v1_tps,v2.tps v2_tps
from version1 v1, version2 v2
where v1.bench_type =v2.bench_type; 
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
>with all_data as
    -> (select * from t1
    -> )select v1.tps v1_tps,v2.tps v2_tps
    -> from (select * from all_data where version ='5.4.0') v1,
    -> (select * from all_data where version ='6.0.0') v2
    -> where v1.bench_type =v2.bench_type;
+---------+--------+
| v1_tps  | v2_tps |
+---------+--------+
| 1111111 | 222222 |
+---------+--------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)

```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
with all_data as
    -> (select * from t1
    -> ),version1 as (select * from all_data where version ='5.4.0'
    -> ),version2 as(select * from all_data where version ='6.0.0')
    -> select v1.tps v1_tps,v2.tps v2_tps
    -> from version1 v1, version2 v2
    -> where v1.bench_type =v2.bench_type;
Empty set (0.05 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
