### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

**Setup the environment:**

**Testcase 1**
```
mysql -h "127.0.0.1" -u root -P 4000 -D testdb

mysql> insert into t_3nyn_c values (52, 91, 89.98, 47, 27, 0, '4nj9nb', 91);
mysql> delete from t_3nyn_c where (t_3nyn_c.wkey % t_3nyn_c.c_9kited) is NULL;
```

**Testcase 2**
```
mysql -h "127.0.0.1" -u root -P 4000 -D testdb

mysql> start transaction;
mysql> insert into t_3nyn_c values (52, 91, 89.98, 47, 27, 0, '4nj9nb', 91);
