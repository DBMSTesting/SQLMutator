Title: "show status like" is not case insensitive
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
`show status like 'ssl_cipher';`

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```sql
mysql> show status like 'ssl_cipher';

+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| Ssl_cipher    |       |
+---------------+-------+
1 row in set (0,00 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```sql
tidb> show status like 'ssl_cipher';

Empty set (0,00 sec)
```

`show status like 'Ssl_chipher';` works.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
```

MySQL has case insensitive match for `LIKE` of status and variables, where TiDB seems to have case sensitive matching of `LIKE` operator.
I also tried with both options for:
```
tidb> SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE FROM mysql.tidb WHERE VARIABLE_NAME='new_collation_enabled';

+----------------+
| VARIABLE_VALUE |
+----------------+
| True           |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0,00 sec)
```
