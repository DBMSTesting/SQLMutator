Title: ddl: truncate partition results in incorrect schema diff
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
/* init */ drop table if exists t;
/* init */ create table t (id int primary key, v int) partition by range (id) (partition p0 values less than (4), partition p_rest values less than maxvalue);
/* init */ insert into t values (1, 10), (3, 30), (5, 50);
/* txn */ begin;
/* txn */ update t set id = 2 where id = 5;
/* ddl */ alter table t truncate partition p0; 
/* txn */ commit; -- This is expected to fail

```
It seems the schema diff is not applied properly for the `truncate` statement. 
The result of `Builder.ApplyDiff` is an emptry array containing no related table ids, which is unexpected.
