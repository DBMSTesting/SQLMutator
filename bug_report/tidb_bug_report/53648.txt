Title: PiTR log is missing a RestoreTS
Description:
## Bug Report

When doing a point in time restore there are two stages. The first stage is the restore of a full backup, for which a `BackupTS` and `RestoreTS` is reported. The next stage is the log restore, for which the range is reported for which the restore is done, but there is no RestoreTS reported.

This is an issue in this case:

1. Start a stream/pitr task on systemA.
2. Start a full backup on systemA.
3. Perform a pitr on systemB.
4. Now run `sync_diff_inspector` to check data integrity
  a. use the `restore-to` TSO from the logs for the TSO of systemA
  b. Now try to get the right TSO for systemB.... There is no `RestoreTS`. Now `SHOW MASTER STATUS` might work, but it would be better to have this in the logs directly.
