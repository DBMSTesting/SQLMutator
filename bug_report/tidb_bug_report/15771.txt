## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. -->
```
mysql> create table test(id int, col_bigint bigint, col_unsigned_bigint bigint unsigned);                                                                                                Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> insert into test values(1,-1,18446744073709551614);                                                                                                                               Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> select case when id = 1 then col_unsigned_bigint else col_bigint end c1 from  test;
+----------------------+
| c1                   |
+----------------------+
| 18446744073709551614 |
+----------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select case when id = 2 then col_bigint else col_unsigned_bigint end c2 from  test;
+----+
| c2 |
+----+
| -2 |
+----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?

the above two sql should return the same result(The same query in Mysql-5.7 return -2)

### 3. What did you see instead?
the first one's return type is bigint unsigned, and the second one's return type is bigint
### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
TiDB master
