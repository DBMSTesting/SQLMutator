Title: `onRenameIndex` not check index's state is `public` or not
Description:
## Bug Report

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/6afbfa2ffcc057470edfcebfa8b48d7f2541027d/ddl/index.go#L317-L339

From the code, we can get if the index `from` is not in public state, the ddl jobs still will success. We only checked it when insert job into the ddl queue.
