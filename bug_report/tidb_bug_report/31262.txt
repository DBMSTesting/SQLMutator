Title: MemTotal inference is flawed when container cgroup memory limit is not set
Description:
## Bug Report

When TiDB runs in container, it will read `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes` to infer memory limit. However, when the cgroup memory limit is not set, the inferred MemTotal would be `9223372036854771712` (LONG_MAX, rounded with page size), which makes the [memory alarm](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/38355172ee7235ffda612ddadf99e47d60b3b051/util/expensivequery/memory_usage_alarm.go#L115) invalid.

According to the code, this inference is also used by `PreparedPlanCacheMaxMemory`, so I suspect that limit would also suffers in container when memory limit is not set.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Run TiDB in container
2. Push TiDB memory usage to the MemTotal of `host`
3. TiDB memory usage exceed 80% but no heap dump occurs according to the log
4. set `memory-usage-alarm-ratio` to `1^-10`
5. Check the MemTotal logged when memory alarm triggerd

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
When the memory limit of container is not set, the memory alarm should fallback to host's MemTotal and trigger heap dump when the memory usage / host MemTotal reaches alarm ratio.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
When the memory limit of container is not set, the memory alarm cannot be properly triggered.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
`v5.3.0`
