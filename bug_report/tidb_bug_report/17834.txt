Title: BACKUP sql command fails on large backup to S3
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

This is a re-open request for https://github.com/tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue/issues/72

It appears that stability has recently improved, but on a large backup I can still trigger a failure.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Success.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

It is a different failure to earlier, but a failure all the same:

```sql
mysql> BACKUP DATABASE `ontime` TO 's3://wwartmp/ontime1';
ERROR 8124 (HY000): Backup failed: msg:"Io(Custom { kind: Other, error: \"failed to put object Request ID: None Body: <?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?><Error><Code>RequestTimeout</Code><Message>Your socket connection to the server was not read from or written to within the timeout period.

```
