Title: Setting `wait_timeout` to 0 doesn't take effect
Description:
## Bug Report

After setting `wait_timeout` to a non-zero value and then setting it back to 0, the connection will still timeout.

```go
func (p *packetIO) readOnePacket() ([]byte, error) {
	var header [4]byte
	if p.readTimeout > 0 {
		if err := p.bufReadConn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(p.readTimeout)); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
	}
...
```

In this function, setting `wait_timeout` to 0 won't go into `SetReadDeadline`, so it doesn't take effect.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```java
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute("set @@wait_timeout=1");
            stmt.execute("set @@wait_timeout=0");
            Thread.sleep(3000);
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select 1");
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The query is executed successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

It reports `CommunicationsException`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
