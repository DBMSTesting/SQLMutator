Title: Inconsistent `Rand()` with seed implementation compared to MySQL
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do?

```sql
TiDB> select rand(1);
+--------------------+
| rand(1)            | 
+--------------------+
| 0.6046602879796196 | 
+--------------------+
```

2. What did you expect to see?

```sql
mysql> select rand(1);
+---------------------+
| rand(1)             | 
+---------------------+
| 0.40540353712197724 | 
+---------------------+
```

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?

This bug was found during the implementation of vectorized push down (https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/6117), where the correct mysql implementation is done (in review) on TiKV side. 

There is a related issue that `RandWithSeed` should not be pushed down for constant arg, or else inconsistency may happen. (https://github.com/pingcap/tipb/pull/162)
