## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

This issue may relate to #12442.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

``` mysql
drop table if exists ttest;
create table ttest (v1 int, v2 int);
insert into ttest values(1, 2), (4,6), (1, 7);

select v1 from ttest order by count(v2);
select v1 from ttest having count(v2);
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

MySQL 8.0.21

```mysql
mysql root@localhost:test> select v1 from ttest order by count(v2);
(3029, 'Expression #1 of ORDER BY contains aggregate function and applies to the result of a non-aggregated query')

mysql root@localhost:test> select v1 from ttest having count(v2);
(1140, "In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'test.ttest.v1'; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by")
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

``` mysql
mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> select v1 from ttest order by count(v2);
+----+

+----+
| 1  |
+----+
1 row in set

mysql root@127.0.0.1:test> select v1 from ttest having count(v2);
