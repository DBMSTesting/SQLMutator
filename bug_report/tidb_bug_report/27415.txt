Title: br slow to fail when PD requires TLS but no tls options given
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. deploy a cluster using tiup with `enable_tls: true`
2. execute br without giving TLS options (`--ca`, `--cert`, `--key`)

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

br should *fail fast* and *communicate to the user* that TLS is required for the connection.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

br takes nearly 2 minutes to fail, and gives a useless error message after that time.
