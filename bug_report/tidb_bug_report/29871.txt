Title: Lightning duplicate-resolution should notify user when there is duplicate data
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Launch 2 lightning instances to import data in parallel, and there are duplicate rows between the data sources.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Lightning should notify user clearly in console and lightning.log so that user can easily know that there are duplicate rows and take actions accordly.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
- when duplicate-resolution = remove, lightning console and lightning log doesn't show any warn or error.
```
==lightning.log==
[2021/11/17 07:01:04.138 +00:00] [INFO] [table_restore.go:789] ["skip checksum&analyze because duplicates were detected"] [table=`xxx`.`xxx`]
```
- when duplicate-resolution = record,  lightning console doesn't show any warn or error, there is only one warn in lightning.log which customer might miss it easily.
```
==lightning.log==
