Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

tidb.toml:
```
enable-telemetry = false
[log.file]
max-size = 1024  # MB
max-days = 7
max-backups = 5
[security]
# Path of the file that contains list of trusted SSL CAs for connection with cluster components.
cluster-ssl-ca = "/home/ubuntu/root.crt"
# Path of the file that contains X509 certificate in PEM format for connection with cluster components.
cluster-ssl-cert = "/home/ubuntu/tls.crt"
# Path of the file that contains X509 key in PEM format for connection with cluster components.
cluster-ssl-key = "/home/ubuntu/tls.key"
```

startup command:
```
/home/ubuntu/.tiup/components/tidb/v5.1.0/tidb-server -P 4000 --status 16010 --store tikv --advertise-address "${tidb_hosts[0]}" --path "${pd_hosts[0]}":2379 --config tidb.toml --config-strict --log-file tidb.log
```

This message is output to the console rather than to the log file specified on the command line:

```
