Title: fast reorg checkpoint has wrong prerequisite
Description:
If the checkpoint record shows the it is generated by current node

we skip the data whose key is smaller that "local storage key watermark" and assume the data is already stay in local storage.

However this is not reliable, especially we are using `/tmp` folder to store the data https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/command-line-flags-for-tidb-configuration#--temp-dir. If the node restarts in many OS `/tmp` folder will be cleaned.
