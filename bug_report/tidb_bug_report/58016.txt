### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The TiDB Server can handle the panic and restart normally.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

It can't restart.

Since when starting, TiDB has to load all bindings into memory, but TiDB has no protective measure for panic, which causes TiDB to be unable to restart successfully.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
