Title: Global sort read index stage file size is too small
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Prepare a large dataset(like 40TB).
2. Add multiple indexes with global sort enabled in a single statement.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

With 16c 32g TiDB instances, each writer should have a memory size of at least 336MB:

```
[2024/03/22 10:00:21.206 +00:00] [INFO] [backfilling_operators.go:130] ["build operators that write index to cloud storage"] ["memory total"=30063026176] ["memoryused"=8549220352] ["memory size"=336153216]
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

But we only get 4.7MB on average:

```
[INFO] [writer.go:573] ["flush sorted kv"] [task-id=300011] [subtask-id=3535] [writer-id=a715fdd6-2a02-431b-9522-6d502a200cb3] [sequence-number=0] [bytes=4790765]
```

This will cause merge sort step and write&ingest step very slow.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
