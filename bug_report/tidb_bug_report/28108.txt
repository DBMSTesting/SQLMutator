Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
go test -run TestPreview

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Success

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

--- FAIL: TestPreview (1.31s)
    telemetry_test.go:84:
        	Error Trace:	telemetry_test.go:84
        	Error:      	Should be true
        	Test:       	TestPreview

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

TiDB master branch

go version go1.16.7 darwin/arm64

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

Although there are two PRs for this #26826, #26785, but the case still fails. According to https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin, `darwin/arm64` should be used to detect apple M1, not `darwin/arm`.
