### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Success

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

If the file exists: the client loses connection and TiDB logs `invalid compressed sequence 2 != 1`
If the file doesn't exist: the client blocks and TiDB logs `not drained yet, try reading left data from client connection`.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

tidb: master

```
$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 8.1.0 for macos12.6 on x86_64 (Homebrew)
