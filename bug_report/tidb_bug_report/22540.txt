Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Prepare a CSV file with more than 60000 rows.
Create a table with auto-random.
Use the load statement to load the data.


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Load data successfully.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

ERROR 2013 (HY000) at line 1: Lost connection to MySQL server during query
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
4.0.4
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->


Root cause:
When load executes, there are two parts. processStream() produces the data. CommitWork() commit the data.
They use the same txn. Between CommitWork() committing the txn and start a new txn. processStream() may use the invalid txn to get the auto-random value, then the get empty data return an error. But we take the error as a warning:

Finally, when using the data, tidb-server panics.
