Title: No `Clone` method for operator `LogicalMaxOneRow` disallow TiDB parallel the apply executor.
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

If we run SQL

```
create table t(a int, b int);
explain analyze select sum(case when 1 then (select sum(b) from t1 where t.a=t1.a group by t.a) else 0 end) from t;
```

And, yeah, this SQL's meaning is strange. We just use it as a simple example.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

If we set the variable `tidb_enable_parallel_apply` to on, we should see that the apply in the SQL above is paralleled.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

It's concurrency is still 1.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

v5.3.1
