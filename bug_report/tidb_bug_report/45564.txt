## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
create table t(a int);
create table t1(a int, b int);
create table t2(a int, b int, c int);
create table t3(a int, b int);
create table t4(a int, b int);
explain format='brief' select * from t left join t1 on t.a=t1.a inner join t2 on t.a=t2.a and t2.c = 100 left join t3 on t2.a=t3.a and t3.b > 1 left join t4 on t2.a = t4.a where (t2.b > 100 or t.a > 10 or t1.b < 10);
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The filter `(t2.b > 100 or t.a > 10 or t1.b < 10)` should be attached either as an independent selection or to an inner join plan.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

The filter is attached to the outer join node.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
