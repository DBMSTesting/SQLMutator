Title: tics: test should check `tidb_enable_change_multi_schema` before changing multi schema
Description:
## Bug Report

**Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!**

Since multi-schema-change is not a feature of release-5.0, we add a variable to prevent side effects from the stability of v5.0.
So tics test should be aware of that and make the tests be compatible with this variable.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
https://internal.pingcap.net/idc-jenkins/blue/organizations/jenkins/tidb_ghpr_tics_test/detail/tidb_ghpr_tics_test/3240/pipeline
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Shouldn't be any literal character like `Unsupported multi schema change`

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Unsupported multi schema change

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
The variable is in [tidb/pull/21533](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/21533)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
