full restored to multirocksdb cluster 
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
checksum would timeout if tikv.end-point-request-max-handle-duration is in default ,and the config changed to 1800s or more can avoid the issue, thus br may detect the config and change it according to region-size

7.1.0
<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
