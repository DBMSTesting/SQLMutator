Title: import into should update id allocator base after import, else might failed to insert new entry
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
for a table with auto_increment/auto_random column, we're only update allocator base before import using our calculated id range, but if source file already contains id that is larger than what we calculated, new insert might fail with duplicate key.

we should rebase the id allocator after import using the max id we have see.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
success insert after import
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
duplicate key
### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
>= 7.2.0
