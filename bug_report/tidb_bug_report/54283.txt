Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Run below sql 
```
create database if not exists test;
use test;
drop table if exists aaa;
--- test case A
prepare stmt from "\ncreate table aaa(id bigint primary key) partition by range (id) interval (100) first partition less than (100) last partition less than (10000) maxvalue partition";
execute stmt;

use test; drop table if exists bbb;
create table bbb(id bigint primary key) partition by range (id) interval (100) first partition less than (100) last partition less than (10000);
-- test case B
prepare stmt2 from "\nalter table bbb last partition less than (20000)";
execute stmt2;

-- test case C
prepare stmt3 from "\nalter table bbb first partition less than (200)";
execute stmt3;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Prepared statement with leading newline to create partition table should succeed.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
