Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
In the million tables and many ddl(add index/change column type) scenrio, the tidb_ddl_add_index_total and tidb_ddl_backfill_percentage_progress metrics will record all the table ddl backfill data. 
The amount of data is too large, and The Grafana needs to consume a significant amount of resources to display this monitoring, which may even cause the browser to freeze.
