3. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
A complete runnable program is good.

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t2;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1xt2;

CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id_1 int(5) NOT NULL,
  t varchar(4) DEFAULT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE t2 (
  id_2 int(5) NOT NULL,
  t varchar(4) DEFAULT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE t1xt2 (
  id_1 int(5) NOT NULL,
  id_2 int(5) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd');
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2, 'bb'), (3, 'cc'), (4, 'dd'), (12, 'aa');
INSERT INTO t1xt2 VALUES (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4);

SELECT DISTINCT t1.id_1 FROM t1 WHERE
(12 NOT IN (SELECT t1xt2.id_2 FROM t1xt2 WHERE t1.id_1 = t1xt2.id_1));

SELECT DISTINCT t1.id_1 FROM t1 WHERE
(12 NOT IN ((SELECT t1xt2.id_2 FROM t1xt2 where t1.id_1 = t1xt2.id_1)));

```

4. What did you expect to see?

the result of two queries should be both
```
+------+
| id_1 |
+------+
| 1    |
| 2    |
| 3    |
| 4    |
+------+

```

5. What did you see instead?
the first is the expected result;
the second is:
```
+------+
| id_1 |
+------+
| 2    |
| 3    |
| 4    |
+------+
```
