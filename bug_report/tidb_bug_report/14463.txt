Title: tidbv3.0.8, sequel pro Cannot open table structure on MAC 
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
TiDB is rollingly upgraded from version v3.0.4 to v3.0.8. Sequel Pro on MAC cannot directly view the table structure. You can use the command: show create table tablename to view the table structure. It can be viewed normally in version v3.0.4. Both SQLyog and Navicat on the window can operate normally before and after the upgrade.

exactly:
In version v3.0.8, Sequel Pro has a small number of tables that can be viewed by the Structure button. Most of the tables are consistently stuck on the Loading page.


2. What did you expect to see?
In the Sequel Pro management interface, select the table and click Structure to view the table structure and edit it.


3. What did you see instead?
When you click the Structure button, Sequel Pro consistently stuck on the Loading interface.


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
