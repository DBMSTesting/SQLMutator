Title: Potential deadlock between `checkFlushLock` and `chunkCpChan` after context cancel, causing Lightning unable to exit after error
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

No concrete repro steps, but the cause is quite obvious from the code itself.

1. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b21bb3e7a71d493ed09606e5171572e90b7001dc/br/pkg/lightning/importer/table_import.go#L678-L691 when the `ctx` is canceled (line 688) through `setError()` (line 695), `chunkCpChan` is not closed/consumed, and there is no longer any receiver for the channel `chunkCpChan`.
2. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b21bb3e7a71d493ed09606e5171572e90b7001dc/br/pkg/lightning/importer/table_import.go#L710-L722 after 16 sends to `chunkCpChan` (line 716), the channel will block any further sends. This caused the lock `checkFlushLock` engaged forever.
3. https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b21bb3e7a71d493ed09606e5171572e90b7001dc/br/pkg/lightning/importer/table_import.go#L800-L806 the deadlock further blocks other goroutines, and prevent WorkGroup from reaching Done(), eventually freezing up the entire program.

We saw this likely caused by an unexpected SIGHUP during batch split & scatter

```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Lightning exit cleanly after cancellation.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Lightning continues idling, not making any progress.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

Lightning v6.5.3

(pretty sure this affects every version of Lightning)
