Title: tidb 5.0 continues to support engine modification
Description:
background:
On a synchronization link like `mysql -> dm -> tidb`, if you upgrade tidb to 5.0, the synchronization will be interrupted, and it will be painful to restore the synchronization. If there is no other special reason, we should continue to support `alter table xx engine = innodb`. Syntax, otherwise it is necessary to communicate with `tidb-tools` to do the upgrade compatibility work, this is very important


5.x：
mysql> alter table order engine=innodb;
ERROR 8200 (HY000): This type of ALTER TABLE is currently unsupported

4.0：
MySQL [test]> alter table order engine=innodb;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
