Title: tidb_enable_reuse_chunk increases the risk of OOM when reading json/text column
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
When a sql reads json/text column from a table, the memory consumption is too large if enabling `tidb_enable_reuse_chunk`.
![NPjt53wIlW](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9039012/218630561-2c276f2d-6205-4def-8309-97dade9514df.jpg)

The json columns will be referred until the SQL is finished when enabling `tidb_enable_reuse_chunk`.

I think we do not need to reuse the columns of type json/text, they consume too large memory.
Considering the implementation, if we only reject the reuse of json/text column, the memory still cannot be GCed because `tidb_enable_chunk_rpc` is on by default. Columns with different type are stored in the same slice when reading from rpc.

We can disable the tidb_enable_chunk_rpc for given SQL if it needs to read json/text column, and enable tidb_enable_chunk_rpc after this SQL is finished.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required) 
Memory usage is stable.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
There is a risk of OOM.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
