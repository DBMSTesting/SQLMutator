Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

My local time zone is `Asia/Shanghai`

```
> create table t(t int);
> insert into t values(NULL);
> set @@time_zone='UTC' --- set a different time zone with local
> alter table t modify column t timestamp not null;
> select now(),t from t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

The value of `now()` and `t` should not differs too much.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

These two columns differs two hours

```
> select t, now() from t
+---------------------+---------------------+
| t                   | now()               |
+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2024-09-12 04:09:36 | 2024-09-12 12:13:47 |
+---------------------+---------------------+
```
