Title: Got unexpected `Error 1105: Can't find column` when executing tp-test
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
Not a minimal one. I ran [tp-test](https://github.com/PingCAP-QE/tp-test/tree/tp-test/tp-test) to verify latest release-4.0 and found a test failed with `Error 1105: Can't find column`. It's unexpected because tp-test will create database for each test and there is no related ddl when doing transactions in a test.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/zyguan/2f88c59e911a6c9571a9019de5267eb6) is the failed test and the log of tidb can be found [here](http://fileserver.pingcap.net/download/pingcap/qa/draft/tp-test-ddl-issue.log).

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

No error reported.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

Error 1105: Can't find column db1__14c2c3fe_d1e6_40c9_973f_598add7765fb.t2.c_int in schema Column.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

release-4.0 (efa487eddc1fd3dafca86a310200fe5d317332c0)
