Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (id int NOT NULL,c1 int NOT NULL,c2 int,
PRIMARY KEY(id),INDEX c1_c2_idx(c1, c2));
INSERT INTO t1 (id, c1, c2) VALUES (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (10,10,1), (11,10,8),
(12,10,1), (13,10,2); 
SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t1 WHERE 1 IN (2, (SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WHERE (c2 = 2)), 3);
SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t1 IGNORE INDEX (c1_c2_idx) WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM DUAL WHERE (c2 = 2));
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (id int NOT NULL,c1 int NOT NULL,c2 int,
    -> PRIMARY KEY(id),INDEX c1_c2_idx(c1, c2));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (id, c1, c2) VALUES (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (10,10,1), (11,10,8),
    -> (12,10,1), (13,10,2); 
Query OK, 6 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t1 WHERE 1 IN (2, (SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WHERE (c2 = 2)), 3);

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

    -> PRIMARY KEY(id),INDEX c1_c2_idx(c1, c2));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

+----+
|  2 |
|  1 |
| 10 |
+----+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t1 IGNORE INDEX (c1_c2_idx) WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM DUAL WHERE (c2 = 2));
