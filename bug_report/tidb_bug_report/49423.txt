Title: Lightning cannot ignore broken symlink
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```sh
mkdir dsd
cd dsd
ln -s non-existing-file.png file-that-should-be-ignored.png
cd ..
./tidb-lightning -d ./dsd --backend tidb --tidb-port 4000
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
tidb lightning exit successfully
```

(nothing should be imported because the directory is effectively empty, the file name of the broken symlink does not match the pattern `db.tbl.123.csv` for instance)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
tidb lightning encountered error: [Lightning:Storage:ErrStorageUnknown]unknown storage error: stat ./dsd/file-that-should-be-ignored.png: no such file or directory
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
