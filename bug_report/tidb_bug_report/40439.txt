Title: formatting of "PD server timeout" error seems wrong
Description:
## Bug Report

`ADMIN CHECK TABLE...` can fail with a `PD server timeout` error like this:

```
sql> admin check table table1;
ERROR: 9001 (HY000): PD server timeout%!(EXTRA string=start timestamp may fall behind safe point)
```

It looks like https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b912237ac78b66057040e7d7d45fb84df6f81548/store/driver/error/error.go#L108 might be where `ErrPDServerTimeout` is used with an extra string.

This happened on v6.1.2 but the code from current master looks to be affected as well.
