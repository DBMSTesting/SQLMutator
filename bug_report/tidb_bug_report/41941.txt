Title: Lightning: remote checksum call SQL than function
Description:
## Problem
Lightning remote checksum calls the same function as the `admin checksum table xxx` SQL statement, but when the checksum failed, it's too hard to locate the checksum problems than the SQL statement way.
## Enhancement
Use `admin checksum table xxx` SQL statement to get the remote checksum
