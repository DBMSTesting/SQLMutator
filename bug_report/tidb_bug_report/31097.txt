Title: Dumpling: The `SortByPk` option is missing a flag
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Inspect the code: There is a `SortByPk` option, but no flag to set it.

This causes issues when exporting data from Vitess as that doesn't support queries like this if the table is sharded:
```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl ORDER BY col1;
```

However it does support:
```sql
SELECT col1, col2, ... FROM tbl ORDER BY col1;
```

Or:
```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl
```

The column in the `ORDER BY` has to be explicitly named in the `SELECT`-list.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
