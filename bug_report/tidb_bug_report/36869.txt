Title: "br restore table --db mysql --table t1" doesn't actually restore mysql.t1
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Create table mysql.t1
2. Make full backup
3. Restore the backup to a new TiDB using cmd:  "br restore table --db mysql --table t1" 

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
mysql.t1 should be restored

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
mysql.t1 not restored.
I have to specify  --with-sys-table to restore mysql.t1,  i.e. "br restore table --db mysql --table t1 --with-sys-table" , this is different behavior compared to 6.1.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
6.2
