Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

The following test case triggers an error on latest version of TiDB
```
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 CHAR DEFAULT '');
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('');
SELECT AVG(t1.c0) FROM t1 GROUP BY t1.c0, true;
```
This is the error message: `Can't group on 'c0'`

I run this test case in MySQL 8.0 and 9.0, both of them run successfully.

Not any error message.
