Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

See: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/faq/tidb/#how-to-use-a-specific-index-with-hint-in-a-sql-statement

### 2. What did you expect to see?

This text is out of date:

"How to use a specific index with hint in a SQL statement?
Its usage is similar to MySQL:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name USE INDEX（index_name）WHERE where_condition;"

It is similar to MySQL, but there are TiDB-specific hints. There should be a link to https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/performance/optimizer-hints/ for detailed discussion.

### 3. What did you see instead?

Docs bug

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
