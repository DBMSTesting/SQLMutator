Title: TiDB digester generates different plan digests for the same plan
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Execute the sysbench select_random_ranges workload:

```
sysbench --config-file=sysbench_config --threads=4 --table-size=1000000 select_random_ranges run
```

which effectively executes the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT
  count (`k`)
FROM
  `sbtest1`
WHERE
  `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
  OR `k` BETWEEN ?
  AND ?
```
