### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

No clear reproduce step, it's found in super big cluster testing with 1 million tables.

From the debugging image, you can see that

The log said that the table is not found in the memory cache. But we can read its table meta from infoschema and can read its stats meta from the physical table `mysql.stats_meta`.
And our stats initialization also reads all the things from `mysql.stats_meta` into memory.

So this `could not find` is very strange and should be treated as a bug.
