Title: lightning: cannot generate value for auto_random column if it's in a composite primary key
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

on tidb 6.5, we can create a table with auto_random column and it's in a composite primary key, while we cannot do it on 6.1
currently lightning check it using pkIsHandle, so will not auto generate data for this column in local backend(tidb backend don't has this problem) if it's the extra column added in downstream but it doesn't exist in source file

we should check it with this now
