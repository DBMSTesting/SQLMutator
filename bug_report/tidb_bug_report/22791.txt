Title: query result for float type is incompatible with previous version
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

create table tf(f1 float(10,2));
insert into tf values("-34028234.66");
select * from  tf;

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
mysql> select * from tf;
+--------------+
| f1           |
+--------------+
| -34028236.00 |
+--------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```
This result is the same with tidb version v4.0 and mysql.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
mysql> select * from tf;
+-----------+
| f1        |
+-----------+
| -34028236 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

```

Seems the float type logic is changed in the master branch and incompatibility is introduced.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
master version with commit hash `9cb9b69b61a76e9cc3f8cfa27f86635c2496cf16`

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
