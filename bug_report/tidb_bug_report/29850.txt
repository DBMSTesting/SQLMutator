Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
run tpcc workload on aws ec2 config

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

below prepared statement, all the predicates are all `equal =`, the optimizer should be able to choose the point get plan. kv_get is cheaper than cop in tikv.

```
SELECT
  `c_discount`,
  `c_last`,
  `c_credit`,
  `w_tax`
FROM
  `customer`,
  `warehouse`
WHERE
  `w_id` = ?
  AND `c_w_id` = `w_id`
  AND `c_d_id` = ?
  AND `c_id` = ?
```
