Title: server: the `0` time returned in prepare stmt can't be parsed correctly by go driver
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
the details referring: https://asktug.com/t/topic/36154/12

MRS:
1: set probably sql mode
2: create table t(a date/datetime/timstamp **default 0**, b int)
3: insert into t(b) values(1),(2);

use go driver: github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.5.0 to query with the following script
```
// 3306 for MySQL comparsion, 4000 for TiDB
dbDSN := fmt.Sprintf("root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test?charset=utf8&parseTime=true&loc=Local")
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dbDSN)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	res, err := db.Query("select a from t where b = ?", 1)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for res.Next() {
		goTime := &time.Time{}
		res.Columns()
		err := res.Scan(&goTime)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		fmt.Println(goTime)
		fmt.Println(time.Now())
	}
}
```
the time will be parsed as `-0001-11-30T00:00:00+08:05` rather than `0001-01-01 00:00:00` which is normal as MySQL does.
 

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
the result should be `0001-01-01 00:00:00` 

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`-0001-11-30T00:00:00+08:05`

### 4. Affected version (Required)

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->
master

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

<!-- should be filled by the investigator before it's closed -->
a bug in dump 0 time in IO
