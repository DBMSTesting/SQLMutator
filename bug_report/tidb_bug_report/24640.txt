Title: SessionPool may contain sessions with valid transaction state which results in TiDB unavailable
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

It's hard to reproduce but it happened.

1. TiDB fails to execute a restricted SQL due to network partition, and the internal session has got a start timestamp.
2. The TiDB is partitioned for a long time and the GC safepoint is greater than the session's start timestamp.
3. Network partition recovers, the internal session will report `GC life time is shorter than transaction duration` forever.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

TiDB is normal.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

As we can see from the log, the session which executes the internal SQL has a valid transaction state and its timestamp is behind the GC safepoint. It may result in TiDB unavailable for new connections because they can't load global variables.
```
[2021/05/12 09:04:49.469 +08:00] [WARN] [conn.go:575] ["open new session failure"] [conn=6546415] [error="[tikv:9006]GC life time is shorter than transaction duration, transaction starts at 2021-05-09 18:59:21.141 +0800 CST, GC safe point is 2021-05-12 08:46:39.215 +0800 CST"]

```

The root cause is that we don't roll back the session if an error occurs in the `ExecRestrictedStmt` like https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14269 did.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
v4.0.6, maybe affect all versions.
