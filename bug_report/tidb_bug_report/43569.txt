Title: Unexpected error `Unknown column 't1.c0' in 'where clause'`
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
The following program triggers this error, but actually `t1.c0` not in `where clause`:

```
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 CHAR);
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 CHAR);
SELECT COUNT(t1.c0) AS c0 FROM  t0 NATURAL JOIN t1  WHERE 'Q';  -- Unknown column 't1.c0' in 'where clause'
```
I notice there are some other reports about this error message. For https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42732 and https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/24324, the test case in this report does not contain subquery; for https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/35031, I tried `SELECT COUNT(t1.c0) AS c0 FROM  t0 NATURAL JOIN t1  WHERE t1.c0=1;` and do not return any error. 
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
No error.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
`Unknown column 't1.c0' in 'where clause'`

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
