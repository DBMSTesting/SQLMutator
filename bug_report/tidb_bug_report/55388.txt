Title: server: the txn scope is impacted by tidb labels unexpectedly
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

When the [`label`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-configuration-file#labels) is set in the config file, the unused and to be deprecated `geo-partition` related logic would introduce side effects on other features like stale read unexpectedly, including:
1. When `data is not ready` error is encounterred, there would be backoff sleep which is unexpect.
2. The `safe_ts` [updater](https://github.com/tikv/client-go/blob/f0f57f28c4f28cb720a068ace40b9d8f7c65307c/tikv/kv.go#L700) in tidb could not get `min_safe_ts` from PD because the txn scope is set incorrectly.

**The `txnScope` and `readReplicaScope` related fields should be removed from the code**.

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The code of the to be deprecated `geo-parition` feature should not have this impact.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
There would be backoff handling errors for stale read
