Title: use `var_samp` as window function cause unexpected error
Description:
## Bug Report
When used with the OVER clause, `var_samp` functions as a window function. When there are non-aggregate columns present, it should not throw an error. 
MySQL does not throw an error, and TiDB also does not throw errors for functions like `var_pop` and `variance`.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
create table t1 (c1 int);
select c1, var_samp(c1) over (partition by c1) from t1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
ERROR 8123 (HY000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'c1'; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
```
