## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
1. hack tidb code, delete following code, so we can set `tidb_mem_quota_query` a very small value to help reproduce this bug   https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/199bf90c2a6e914d05733bc6dacd9ed2dea77b7f/pkg/sessionctx/variable/sysvar.go#L1127-L1130 
2. build tidb and start tiup playround
3. download [10-tidb-slow.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16422699/10-tidb-slow.log) and `set @@tidb_slow_query_file = '/home/guojiangtao/10-tidb-slow.log';` (remember to change the slow query file path)
4. `set @@tidb_mem_quota_query = 10;`
5. run `select time,host host_ip,Query_time as exec_max_time,parse_time,compile_time,Query as sql_text,Digest as sql_id,is_internal,succ, Plan as plan_text,mem_max as mem_max,User as parse_user,DB as database_name,total_keys,request_count,process_time,process_keys from information_schema.SLOW_QUERY order by time desc;`
