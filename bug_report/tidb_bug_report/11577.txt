Title: The usage of TypeDecimal in TiDB could be problematic 
Description:
Per our internal discussion, TypeDecimal is reserved for uninitialized type. While in our code base, it is treated as double or even new decimal. 

Just take two examples as follows:
https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/3faafb2d5e78851be1edfaf1a3e206ed75e09981/types/field_type_test.go#L281

https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/5c35082f6af637f13f5d4a936a1e91f94e520259/expression/builtin_time.go#L4395

I strongly suggest we need review the usage of TypeDecimal.
