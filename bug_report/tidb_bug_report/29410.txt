### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master branch, commit 731902de583687d7a7ad9a69b0038d16fd445741
go version 1.17.2
macOS monterey 12.0.1

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->

The cause of the `diff` failure is due to there are two more invalid utf8 bytes `\xef\xbf` at the end of the generated go files. So https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/731902de583687d7a7ad9a69b0038d16fd445741/parser/goyacc/main.go#L270 fails to format the generated file. The parser structure gets a `Tail`:
```
· Tail: &parser.Tail{
· · Value: "\n\xef\xbf",
· · Token: parser.y:13724:1: MARK "%%", Comments: [],
· }  
```
Don't know where the two bytes comes. The y files don't have the bytes at the end.
