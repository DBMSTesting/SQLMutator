Title: TiDB cluster doesnt start-up correctly
Description:
## Bug Report

Hello, I'm currently trying to deploy TiDB on kubernetes with the tidb-operator but I'm encountering several problems and I can't solve them. So I'm turning to you for help.
I'm encountering two problems:
- The first is that the TiDB pods don't want to launch when the TiDB cluster starts up. So I have no way of interacting with them. 
To get them to launch correctly, I have to wait two full days for the installation to work

. This doesn't seem optimal to me, nor does it match your quickstart on your documentation. I really don't understand why TiDB pods react the way they do to a basic configuration.
- Secondly, I have a problem with the internal configuration of the pods, which can't communicate with each other at all, and this is a real problem for debugging. My pd pods can't interact with my Tikv pods. I've tried debugging with this link [https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/network-issues](url) but can't find a solution except that my pods return "connection refused" when I try to curl their internal ip address.

In the following example, I'm also trying to deploy PD as a microservice (perhaps my deployment isn't right), but I've also tried without setting PD as a microservice and that didn't work either.

For operator deployment, I use the chart you provided. I also work offline, so I have to download my images and charts.

Here is my manifest for my deployment : 

For tidb-operator : 
[values-tidb-operator.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16064616/values-tidb-operator.txt)

For my cluster : 
[basic-deploy-tidb-cluster.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16064625/basic-deploy-tidb-cluster.txt)




### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Deploy the tidb-operator with advanced statefulset enabled :

- Advanced-StatefulSet-Controller
- tidb-controller-manager

Deploy a basic tidb cluster with pd as ms :

- 3 PD nodes
- 2 Tso
- 1 Scheduling
- 3 TiKV
- 3 TiDB
- 3 TiFlash
- 3 TiProxy
- 1 Discovery

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

I expect my TiDBs to build straight away, or to understand why it takes so long to get started.
Understanding why my pods can't communicate

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

I've seen my TiDB pods launch two days later or never launch at all.
I've seen my pods never communicate with each other. 

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

tidb-operator : 1.6.0
advanced-statefulset : 0.3.3
tidb : 8.1.0

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
