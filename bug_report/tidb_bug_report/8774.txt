Title: TiKV client API won't compile
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.
I was trying to experiment with the TiKV client API by following the docs at https://github.com/pingcap/docs/blob/master/tikv/go-client-api.md                                                                                                                                     

2. What did you expect to see?
The example code compiles successfully.


3. What did you see instead?
The example code doesn't compile when I run `go build`.
```
$GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos/etcd/clientv3/auth.go:116:72: cannot use auth.callOpts (type []"github.com/coreos/etcd/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc".CallOption) as type []"go.etcd.io/etcd/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc".CallOption in argument to auth.remote.AuthEnable
(along with 8 similar lines differing only in line number)
```
I found that the package `github.com/coreos/etcd` had moved to `go-etcd.io/etcd`.
I changed all occourences of `github.com/coreos/etcd` to `go-etcd.io/etcd` in `github.com/pingcap/tidb` as well as `github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools`. Then I ran `go build` again and got the following output:
```
$GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/tidb/store/tikv/kv.go:56:14: cannot use []"google.golang.org/grpc".DialOption literal (type []"google.golang.org/grpc".DialOption) as type []"go.etcd.io/etcd/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc".DialOption in field value
```
This suggests a problem caused by vendoring. The vendored package `go.etcd.io/etcd/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc` is different from the real package `google.golang.org/grpc`, which prevents dependencies from sharing structs. I removed the vendored package so that the real package is used, and the code compiled successfully.
