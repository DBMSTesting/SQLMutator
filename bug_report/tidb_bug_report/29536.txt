Title: Potential OOM. There is no parameter to limit the size of stmtSummaryByDigestEvictedElement.digestKeyMap
Description:
## Bug Report
I want to known if it is necessary to provide a parameter to limit the size of *stmtSummaryByDigestEvictedElement.digestKeyMap*.

When the user has too many sql digests,  *digestKeyMap* will be so large that  an *Out of Memory Exception* might be caused.

#### How to construct so many sql digests?

Suppose Table A is a wide table which has n columns like c<sub>1</sub>„ÄÅc<sub>2</sub>...c<sub>n</sub>.

n Normalized SQLs:
update A set c<sub>x</sub> = ?  where id = ?

n<sup>2</sup> Normalized SQLs:
update A where c<sub>x</sub> = ? and  c<sub>y</sub> = ? where id = ?
...
Total = 2<sup>n</sup> - 1

It is possible when the business user only updates the changed columns.
