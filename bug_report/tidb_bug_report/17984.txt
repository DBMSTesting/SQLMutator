Description:
## Bug Report

- make a region r1 as `kv1, kv2, kv3, tiflash1`

- make kv1 became DownPeers in PD

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

leader request continue retry in kv1, kv2, kv3 and go to right leader after election finished.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

have risk leader request will go to tiflash1 and forever retry on it.

### 4. Affected version (Required)

<!-- v3.0.0, v4.0.0, etc -->

4.0

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

introduce "filter down peer" mechanism in region cache, and it will lead store length became different at different time.

but time current retry context rely on PeerIdx， so for above example：

1st try： request idx will be `2` in `kv1, kv2, kv3, tiflash1`
if we load region and got filtered list will be `kv2, kv3, tiflash1`
2nd retry: request idx still be `2`...but retry store will be `tiflash1` not `kv3`
