### 1. What did you do?

<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. -->
```
mysql> create table pt (a int primary key, b int)
 partition by range (a)
 (partition p0 values less than(10), 
partition p1 values less than(20), 
partition p2 values less than(30));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

mysql> insert into pt values(1, 1), (11, 11), (21, 21);

mysql> select * from t;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> create view vt (a, b) as select a, b from t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```
mysql> select * from pt, t where pt.a < 10 and pt.b = t.b;
+---+------+------+------+
| a | b    | a    | b    |
+---+------+------+------+
| 1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |
+---+------+------+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from pt, vt where pt.a < 10 and pt.b = vt.b;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
### 2. What did you expect to see?
The two queries above should have the same result `1, 1, 1, 1`.
### 3. What did you see instead?
When we use the view `vt`, the result set is empty.
### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
