Title: P1-[4.0 bug hunting]-[SQL Plan Management]-Incorrect result when using SPACE() in a predicate
Description:
## Description
Bug Hunter issue tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue#6

---

Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (100000);
SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE NOT SPACE(t0.c0); -- expected: {100000}, actual: {}
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` does not fetch any rows:
```

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (100000);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE NOT SPACE(t0.c0);
Empty set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
```
Note that the query prints the following warning:
```
mysql> show warnings;
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                                                                  |
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Warning | 1105 | Result of space() was larger than max_allowed_packet (65536) - truncated |
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
Nevertheless, I would expect the row to be fetched. This is the case when replacing the column by a constant:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (100000);
SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE NOT SPACE(100000); -- {100000}
```
I checked with MySQL 8.0.19, which produces the result I would expect:
```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 19

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (100000);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE NOT SPACE(t0.c0);
+--------+
| c0     |
+--------+
| 100000 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
I propose P0 as a bug level, since it matches the following description: `wrong results returned by the query, and inconsistent results returned by the SQL output`.
