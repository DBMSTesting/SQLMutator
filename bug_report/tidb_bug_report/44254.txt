## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

1. Set the `tidb_mem_quota_query` to a small value.
2. Run a statement which will cause OOM in planner or `executor.Open` phase.
3. All following statement will fail directly, even if it consumes only one byte. With internal logs, we could see the mem trackers are never detached, and the children of global tracker gets more and more.
