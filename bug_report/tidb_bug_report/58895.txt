Title: TiDB accepts special character as json path leg, but MySQL doesn't
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
SELECT json_extract("[1E27]", "$.ѿ")
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
ERROR 3143 (42000): Invalid JSON path expression. The error is around character position 4.
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
mysql> select json_extract("[1E27]", "$.ѿ");
+--------------------------------+
| json_extract("[1E27]", "$.ѿ")  |
+--------------------------------+
| NULL                           |
+--------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

In MySQL document, it says the key name must be `ESIdentifier | doubleQuotedString`. The `doubleQuotedString` accepts special character, but `ESIdentifier` not.

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

<!-- Paste the output of SELECT tidb_version() -->
