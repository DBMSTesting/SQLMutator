Title: parser warnings are ignored
Description:
## Development Task

After refactor in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16056, parser warnings would be ignored, since `ResetContextOfStmt` in `ExecuteStmt` would reset `StmtCtx` hence those warnings are cleared.

For example:
```
MySQL [test]> select /*+ use_index_merge() */ * from t where a = 10 or b = 10;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
parser returns warning for this optimizer hint and tidb ignores it.
