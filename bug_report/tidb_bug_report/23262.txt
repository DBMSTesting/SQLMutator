Title: The type of year compare with 1- or 2-digit strings is not as expected
Description:
## Bug Report
According to the [mysql manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/year.html)

> As 1- or 2-digit strings in the range '0' to '99'. MySQL converts values in the ranges '0' to '69' and '70' to '99' to YEAR values in the ranges 2000 to 2069 and 1970 to 1999.

The TiDB didn't cover the converts of year type.
