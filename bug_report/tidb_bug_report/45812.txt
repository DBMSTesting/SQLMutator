Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Prepare sysbench table with 1,000,000 rows.

```sql
mysql> prepare stmt from 'select /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1) */ sum(id) from sbtest1';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> execute stmt;
mysql> execute stmt; -- run it two times
```

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```sql
mysql> execute stmt;
ERROR 3024 (HY000): Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded
mysql> execute stmt;
ERROR 3024 (HY000): Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```sql
mysql> execute stmt;
