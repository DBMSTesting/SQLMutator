Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Last lightning import with checkpoint enabled fails for some reasons, e.g. ulimit setting is too low
2. The error is corrected 
3. Try to run the lightning import job again

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
1.  There should be stdout output let user know what they need to do.
2. Information regarding how to handle the error should be appropriate. 
 - If we are sure checkpoint-error-ignore and resume from checkpoint is OK, we should recommend customer to do so to avoid oncalls, otherwise,  checkpoint-error-destroy should be executed

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
1. Currently, there is no enough information stdout regarding how to handle the error.

2. In lightning log, there are recommended actions, but it might not be the best option in this case, user might want to ignore the error and resume the import from the checkpoint.
