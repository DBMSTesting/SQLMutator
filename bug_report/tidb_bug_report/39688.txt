## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Change the code via the diff:
```diff
diff --git a/br/pkg/streamhelper/basic_lib_for_test.go b/br/pkg/streamhelper/basic_lib_for_test.go
index 882ac69ede..9598b5d376 100644

-               return nil, t.cx.Err()
+               return nil, status.Error(codes.Canceled, t.cx.Err().Error())
        }
 }
 ```
This is a reasonable change because in real-world clusters, once the context for the server streaming canceled, gRPC yields this error instead of plain `context.Canceled`.
<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

Then run the test `TestHasFailureStores`.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The test passes.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
The test failed.
```

        	            	 -  rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
Current master.
