### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```
CREATE TABLE some_table (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	data VARCHAR(50),
	parent_id INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	FOREIGN KEY(parent_id) REFERENCES some_table (id)
)

INSERT INTO some_table (id, data, parent_id) VALUES (1, 'd1', NULL),(2, 'd2', 1),(3, 'd3', 1),(4, 'd4', 3),(5, 'd5', 3)

WITH recursive some_cte(id, data, parent_id)
AS
  (
         SELECT some_table.id        AS id,
                some_table.data      AS data,
                some_table.parent_id AS parent_id
         FROM   some_table
         WHERE  some_table.data IN ('d2',
                                    'd3',
                                    'd4')
         UNION ALL
         SELECT some_table_1.id        AS id,
                some_table_1.data      AS data,
                some_table_1.parent_id AS parent_id
         FROM   some_table             AS some_table_1,
                some_cte               AS c1
         WHERE  some_table_1.id = c1.parent_id
  )
  SELECT   some_cte.data
  FROM     some_cte
  WHERE    some_cte.data != 'd2'
  ORDER BY some_cte.data DESC
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
