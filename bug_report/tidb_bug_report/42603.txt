Title: Useless partition pruning warning for `ANALYZE TABLE` statement
Description:
## Bug Report

1. Warning about partition pruning for something that uses all partitions isn't really helpful as partition pruning wouldn't be used anyway.
2. Warning about missing statistics for a `ANALYZE TABLE` statement isn't really helpful either as this is what would populate the stats.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->
```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c1 int)
partition by range(c1)
(partition p0 values less than (100),
partition p1 values less than maxvalue);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(200),(400),(600);
ANALYZE TABLE t1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)


```
sql> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 int)
   -> partition by range(c1)
   -> (partition p0 values less than (100),
   -> partition p1 values less than maxvalue);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.2005 sec)

sql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(200),(400),(600);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.0240 sec)

Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

sql> ANALYZE TABLE t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 2 warnings (0.1893 sec)
Note (code 1105): Analyze use auto adjusted sample rate 1.000000 for table test.t1's partition p0
Note (code 1105): Analyze use auto adjusted sample rate 1.000000 for table test.t1's partition p1
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
sql> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 int)
   -> partition by range(c1)
   -> (partition p0 values less than (100),
   -> partition p1 values less than maxvalue);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.2005 sec)

sql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(200),(400),(600);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.0240 sec)

Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

sql> ANALYZE TABLE t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 4 warnings (0.1893 sec)
Warning (code 1105): disable dynamic pruning due to t1 has no global stats
Note (code 1105): Analyze use auto adjusted sample rate 1.000000 for table test.t1's partition p0
Warning (code 1105): disable dynamic pruning due to t1 has no global stats
Note (code 1105): Analyze use auto adjusted sample rate 1.000000 for table test.t1's partition p1
