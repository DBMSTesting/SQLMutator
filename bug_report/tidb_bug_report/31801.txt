Title: `LEAST`  function with DATETIME shows serious discrepancy with MySQL when to use `CAST`
Description:
## Bug Report

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1; 
CREATE TABLE t1 (a TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6) ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6));
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('2001-01-01 00:00:00.1');
SELECT CAST(LEAST(a, '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS SIGNED) AS a FROM t1;
SELECT CAST(LEAST(a, '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS DECIMAL(30,6)) AS a FROM t1;
SELECT CAST(LEAST(CAST('2001-01-01 00:00:00.1' as DATETIME(6)), '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS DECIMAL(30,6)) AS a;
DROP TABLE t1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see?  
```sql
mysql> SELECT CAST(LEAST(a, '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS SIGNED) AS a FROM t1;
+----------------+
| a              |
+----------------+
| 20010101000000 |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT CAST(LEAST(a, '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS DECIMAL(30,6)) AS a FROM t1;
+-----------------------+
| a                     |
+-----------------------+
| 20010101000000.100000 |
+-----------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT CAST(LEAST(CAST('2001-01-01 00:00:00.1' as DATETIME(6)), '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS DECIMAL(30,6)) AS a;
+-----------------------+
| a                     |
+-----------------------+
| 20010101000000.100000 |
+-----------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


```

### 3. What did you see instead
```sql
tidb> SELECT CAST(LEAST(a, '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS SIGNED) AS a FROM t1;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| 2001 |
+------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.03 sec)

tidb> SELECT CAST(LEAST(a, '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS DECIMAL(30,6)) AS a FROM t1;
+-------------+
| a           |
+-------------+
| 2001.000000 |
+-------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

tidb> SELECT CAST(LEAST(CAST('2001-01-01 00:00:00.1' as DATETIME(6)), '2001-01-02 00:00:00.1') AS DECIMAL(30,6)) AS a;
+-------------+
| a           |
+-------------+
| 2001.000000 |
