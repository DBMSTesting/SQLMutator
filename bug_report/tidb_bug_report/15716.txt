Title: An immediate read after two UPDATE transactions does not pick up the change in the other transaction
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. What did you do?

<!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error. -->

I run the following script which consists of two transactions. After both transactions commit, a first SELECT cannot see the UPDATE by the other session. However if I run the same SELECT again, it picks up the UPDATE by the other session.

```sql
create table test (id int primary key, value int);
insert into test (id, value) values (1, 10), (2, 20);

begin; -- T1
begin; -- T2

update test set value = 11 where id = 1; -- T1
update test set value = 19 where id = 2; -- T1
update test set value = 12 where id = 1; -- T2. Blocked
commit; -- T1. This unblocks T2
update test set value = 18 where id = 2; -- T2
commit; -- T2

select * from test; -- T1. Shows 1 => 11, 2 => 19 (caching problem?)
select * from test; -- T1. Shows 1 => 12, 2 => 18 (correct result)
```
### 2. What did you expect to see?

The last two SELECT should return same result.

### 3. What did you see instead?

The next to last SELECT returns a result that does not reflect the change by T2.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)
