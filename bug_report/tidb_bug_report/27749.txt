Title: Lightning import 35k tables failed on new cluster for too many empty regions and region distribution is unbalanced
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
1. Deploy a new cluster
2. Use lightning to import 35K table (437M, with partitions in some of the schema) to tidb
    Data source: http://minio.pingcap.net:9000/minio/nfs/tools_test_data/new_data1/

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
Import should be successful, or fail with clear error messages.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
Lighting import failed for following preCheckRequirements  errors:
- TiKV stores (1, 4, 5) contains more than 1000 empty regions respectively, which will greatly affect the import speed and success rate. 
- Region distribution is unbalanced, the ratio of the regions count of the store(56) with least regions(0) to the store(5) with most 

Issues here:
1, Per current implementation, preCheckRequirements is after restoreSchema, in this case restoreSchema takes over 30 minutes, and then preCheckRequirements failed, this is not reasonable. We should try to move precheck before restoreSchema so that we can fast fail.
2, The error message is not very user friendly, this is a new cluster, customer might be confused why the error happens on the new cluster.
