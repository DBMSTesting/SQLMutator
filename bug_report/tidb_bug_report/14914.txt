admin@ip-172-30-101-35:~$ mysql -h a4c7ba19a3b5b4d1ebb1c9c3b80717cc-8623445e5cc961e7.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com -P 4000 -u root

```
As showed above, after I changed the root password and execute `FLUSH PRIVILEGES`, I can still login mysql with the old password for about 3~5 minutes.

2. What did you expect to see?
As per the [document](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/sql/statements/flush-privileges/#mysql-compatibility), old password should be invalidated once `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` succeed.

3. What did you see instead?
Old password still took effect.

4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
`v4.0.0-beta-52-gfa6f1c58c`
