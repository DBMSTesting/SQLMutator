Title: Table attributes like fk_info and index_info is changed from null to [].
Description:
## Bug Report

When a simple table is created without index and fk, some of its attributes, for example, fk_info and index_info would be null returned by the following api.
 '(http://{TiDBIP}:10080/schema/{db}/{table})' 
However, once the table is backup and restored. attributes like fk_info and index_info would change to [] instead of null. This would trigger issues like https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/51807.
Here is a few things we might need to review.
(1) Shall we keep the attribute consistent before and after restore?
(2) Now we have fixed the precheck in exchange partition, is there other precheck needs to be fixed in tidb?

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
(1) create a table and check its attribute with the following api.
 '(http://{TiDBIP}:10080/schema/{db}/{table})' 
(2) backup the cluster and restore it to another cluster.
(3) check its attribute to see if there is any changes, for example, from null to [].
