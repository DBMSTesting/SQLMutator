## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
--Tidb is allowing variables in view select , mysql is not:
create table t1 (a int, b int);
set @v1=10;
create view v1 (c,d) as select a,b+@v1 from t1;

--WITH CHECK OPTION should be  syntactically compatible :
create view v2  as select a from t1 WITH CHECK OPTION;
```
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```sql
mysql> create view v1 (c,d) as select a,b+@v1 from t1;
ERROR 1351 (HY000): View's SELECT contains a variable or parameter

mysql> create view v2  as select a from t1 WITH CHECK OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```
