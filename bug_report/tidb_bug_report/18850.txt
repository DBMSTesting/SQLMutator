Title: executor: unexpected result for hash join on `enum` and `set` columns
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
tidb> create table t(a int, b enum('A', 'B'));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

tidb> create table t1(a1 int, b1 enum('B', 'A'));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

tidb> insert into t values (1, 'A');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

tidb> insert into t1 values (1, 'A');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

tidb> select /*+ HASH_JOIN(t, t1) */ * from t join t1 on t.b = t1.b1;
```

Step 2 and 3 followed below behaves exact the same if `enum` is replaced with `set` for the step above.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
mysql> select * from t join t1 on t.b = t1.b1;
+------+------+------+------+
| a    | b    | a1   | b1   |
+------+------+------+------+
|    1 | A    |    1 | A    |
+------+------+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
```
tidb> select /*+ HASH_JOIN(t, t1) */ * from t join t1 on t.b = t1.b1;
Empty set (0.01 sec)
```

### 4. Affected version (Required)

v4.0.x

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

It looks that when building the HashTable used by HashJoin, the hash key is built from the offset of `enum`/`set` value:

When the values of `enum`/`set` have different offsets by their definitions, the join result would be wrong.
