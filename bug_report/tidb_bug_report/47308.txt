Title: util: remove noisy logs for stale read
Description:
## Enhancement

Many noisy logs are printed when stale read is used
```
[2023/09/22 22:58:36.055 +00:00] [WARN] [builtin_time.go:6639] [calAppropriateTime] [minTime=2023/09/22 22:57:36.055 +00:00] [maxTime=2023/09/22 22:58:36.055 +00:00] [minSafeTime=2023/09/22 22:57:35.289 +00:00]
```
It should not be printed as `WARN` log level
