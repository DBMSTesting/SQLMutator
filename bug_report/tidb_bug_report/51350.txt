Title: Incorrect datatype transformation when compare decimal and float
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 FLOAT,c1 FLOAT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (0, 1.1);
CREATE VIEW v0(c1, c2) AS SELECT t1.c0, CAST(t1.c1 AS DECIMAL) FROM t1;

SELECT v0.c2 FROM v0 WHERE (CASE v0.c2 WHEN v0.c1 THEN 1 ELSE 1 END );
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
mysql> SELECT v0.c2 FROM v0;
+------+
| c2   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
```

Since v0.c2 is 1, so the following sql should return 1.

`SELECT v0.c2 FROM v0 WHERE (CASE v0.c2 WHEN v0.c1 THEN 1 ELSE 1 END );`

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

However, it returns 1.100000023841858000000000000000.

```
mysql> SELECT v0.c2 FROM v0 WHERE (CASE v0.c2 WHEN v0.c1 THEN 1 ELSE 1 END );
+----------------------------------+
| c2                               |
+----------------------------------+
| 1.100000023841858000000000000000 |
+----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

If you execute sql `SELECT v0.c2 FROM v0;`,it works well

```
mysql> SELECT v0.c2 FROM v0;
+------+
| c2   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
TiDB-v7.6.0
