Title: Support TIMESTAMP with explicit time zone
Description:
## Enhancement
In MySQL 8.0.19, the timestamp (or really datetime) literal support explicit time zone, like `TIMESTAMP'2024-03-13 11:33:44+01:00'`
see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-literals.html

So the suggestion is to allow the "[+-][0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]" syntax for the TIMESTAMP literal, and handling it without any other time zone conversions, apart from adjusting the time accordingly to the given time zone offset.

The reason is to give developers a more straight forward way of inserting timestamps and datetimes without having to change the `@@time_zone` variable or be affected by internal time zone handling when inserting or querying data.
