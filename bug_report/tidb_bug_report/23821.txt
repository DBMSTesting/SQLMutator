### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

There are a large number of instances of slow query log entries where the query text is only two hyphens, "--":
```
# Plan_digest: a41974224880ad5717cb3f77dadfcfdf40f870a0aac8bbb6ca69f0cd51447d65
--
```

There are some others where a "use <db>;" statement shows up in addition to the hyphens:
```
# Plan_digest: a41974224880ad5717cb3f77dadfcfdf40f870a0aac8bbb6ca69f0cd51447d65
use db1;
--
```

I've also seen some situations where Plan_digest is missing!
```
# Plan: tidb_decode_plan('xesD8DwwCTNfOTIJMAkyLjQ...
--
```
