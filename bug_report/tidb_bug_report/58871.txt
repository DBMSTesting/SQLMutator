Title: PD error is not checked in `waitVersionSyncedWithoutMDL`
Description:
## Bug Report

here error is not checked https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/b74eb0f906a73215548c1cf2352c41a802ea37f9/pkg/ddl/schema_version.go#L408

If PD goes wrong here, the error is ignored and continue with `ver=0`. Then It uses `0` to create a snapshot and `latestSchemaVersion` will be `0` too and `updateGlobalVersionAndWaitSynced` will not work.
