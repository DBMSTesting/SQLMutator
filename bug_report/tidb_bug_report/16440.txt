Title: A NOT NULL predicate unexpectedly evaluates to TRUE
Description:
Consider the following statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (NULL);
SELECT t1.c0 FROM t1 WHERE NOT t1.c0; -- expected: {}, actual: {NULL}
```
Unexpectedly, the `SELECT` fetches a row, even though the `NOT t1.c0` should evaluate to `NULL`.

This seems to be a regression bug. On commit 72f457674238d28435b874af2899f7f684140a49, this still works correctly. On commit d26875db7e95b157fe57a5c68b8310f4212cbb32, this starts failing. Thus, I suspect that the fix for https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16108 is the culprit. /CC @XuHuaiyu 

I can reproduce this both on the latest master (d901863643afb1a40ae96b1ee800e8a8c6d5808a), and also checked that this bug still occurs with the https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16430 fix (commit 5370f815d812622fa4560bc546d3a5ce9d15e005).
