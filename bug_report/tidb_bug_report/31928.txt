### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

1. Build the failpoint package and run with failpoint enabled.
```bash
make failpoint-enable
make && cd bin
GO_FAILPOINTS="github.com/pingcap/tidb/server/enableTestAPI=return(true)" tiup playground nightly --monitor=false --tiflash=0 --db.binpath=./tidb-server
```

2. Prepare data with this [script](https://gist.github.com/you06/b941a0adaabfc4a59f0c6c9c3bc5d1d0).

3. Inject with 5 secs sleep before commit phase(this will not affect 1pc).

```bash
curl -X PUT -d "sleep(5000)" "http://127.0.0.1:10080/fail/tikvclient/beforeCommit"
``` 

4. Execute the insert from the first connection then select from the second session.

| Conn1 | Conn2 |
|-|-|
|`set tidb_enable_1pc=off;`|`set tidb_enable_streaming=1;`|
|`insert into t values(1001, 1001);`||
||`select * from t;`|
|`Query OK, 1 row affected (5.006 sec)`|`2153 rows in set (1.734 sec)`|
