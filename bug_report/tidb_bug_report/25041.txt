Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

<!-- a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. -->

```
select region_id from information_schema.tikv_region_status join information_schema.tikv_region_peers using (region_id) group by region_id;
```

```
create table t1 (id int);
create table t2 (id int);
select id, count(*) from t1 join t2 using (id) group by id;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

This query should return results, because there cannot be any ambiguity when grouping on a column that is covered by the join condition.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR 1052 (23000): Column 'region_id' in field list is ambiguous
```

This type of query can execute without any error in MySQL:

```
8.0.23 (root) [test]> create table t1 (id int); create table t2 (id int); select id, count(*) from t1 join t2 using (id) group by id;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
