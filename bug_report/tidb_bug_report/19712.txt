### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
- Set up TiCDC to sync from a TiDB to another TiDB through Kafka by Avro protocol.
- Create table in the upstream.
- Insert some data in the upstream.
- Open a new connection with a mysql client manually to the downstream, and verify that the table exists and data have been inserted.
- Use an old connection (established before the create table DDL) to the downstream TiDB to prepare a select statement from the table.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
- Query runs normally, at least not complaining that the table doesn't exists.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
- Error 1146

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)
