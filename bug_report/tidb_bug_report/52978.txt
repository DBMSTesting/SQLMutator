Title: `min(truncate())` may lead to incorrect result
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
Firstly, execute `init.sql` to create the table. Then executing `error.sql` yields unexpected results. Note that reproducing these results might not be entirely stable. Typically, it can be completed within three attempts. You can try executing `error.sql` multiple times or execute `init.sql` again to rebuild the table.

[error.sql.txt](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/files/15146883/error.sql.txt)


### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The first column represents the minimum value of the `c_ou2` column within each group,
the second column represents the maximum value of the `c_ou2` column within each group,
and the third column represents the minimum value of `truncate(-26340, c_ou2)`. If there exists a `c_ou2` greater than 0, there should be a result of -26340, which is necessarily the minimum value.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
In the multi-node version: correct.
In the single-node version: The value in the third column of the second row is incorrectly 0; it should be -26340.

### about us
We are the BASS team from the School of Cyber Science and Technology at Beihang University. Our main focus is on system software security, operating systems, and program analysis research, as well as the development of automated program testing frameworks for detecting software defects. Using our self-developed database vulnerability testing tool, we have identified the above-mentioned vulnerabilities in TiDB that may lead to database logic error.
