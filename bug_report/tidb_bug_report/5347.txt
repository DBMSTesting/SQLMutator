Title: Fail to LOAD CSV file if column has newline character (\n)
Description:
Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

1. What did you do?
Importing CSV file using `LOAD` command:

```
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/tmp/3xe79apu.csv' INTO TABLE test.t
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
```

Some text column may contains `\n`.

2. What did you expect to see?

The `LOAD` command executes successfully, just like MySQL does.

3. What did you see instead?

The client got `ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query`.

And the tidb.log shows
