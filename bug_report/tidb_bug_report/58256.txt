Title: The integer primary key is not included in the `information_schema.tidb_index_usage`
Description:
I recorded the index usage of clustered primary keys and integer primary keys in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/55602, but when the primary key is an integer, it'll not show in the `Index` list of `TableInfo`, so it doesn't appear in the `information_schema.tidb_index_usage` table ðŸ¤¦ .

My fault. The previous PR doesn't have any E2E test.
