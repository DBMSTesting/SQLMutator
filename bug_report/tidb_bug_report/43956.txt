Title: When creating a table in v5.4.3, the empty region of the cluster appears unexpectedly, causing a significant increase in the cluster's duration.
Description:
1. Version: TiDB 5.4.3

2. 
Scenario 1: Only create a single table, and increase the pre-split region count to 13 using PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS due to special requirements.

such as:
CREATE TABLE `test1` (
 xxx
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS=13 PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS=13 COMMENT='xxx'
PARTITION BY RANGE (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(`xxx`))
xxx

Exception 1: Creating a table causes the empty-region in the cluster to surge by 400K, with visible effects on Region Health monitoring, and multiple TiKV servers experiencing a significant increase in regions.

3.
Scenario 2: Business scenario requirement, synchronize table structure from logical database A to logical database B, only synchronize table structure. There are 100+ tables with structures on the production line.

Exception 2: Creating a table causes the empty-region of the cluster to skyrocket by 400K, and the Region Health monitoring shows abnormal behavior, with multiple TiKV server regions clearly increasing.
