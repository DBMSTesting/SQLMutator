**Note:** According to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/date-and-time-literals.html,

> The `TIMESTAMP` syntax produces a `DATETIME` value in MySQL because `DATETIME` has a range that more closely corresponds to the standard SQL `TIMESTAMP` type, which has a year range from 0001 to 9999. (The MySQL `TIMESTAMP` year range is 1970 to 2038.)
