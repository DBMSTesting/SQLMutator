Title: Retrying sending requests to a stuck TiKV may cost too much time
Description:
## Bug Report

In client-go, when sending request to TiKV and there is an RPC error, it can retry several times.  It's mostly controlled by a hard-coded constant: 

```go
const maxReplicaAttempt = 10
```

It looks reasonable somehow. However, sometimes the RPC errors are thrown after being blocked for a long time, and then interrupted due to timeout. If we retry for 10 times, it can cost 10 times the timeout (`ReadTimeoutShort` 30s or `ReadTimeoutMedium` 60s). We currently suspect that this behavior causes TiDB's recovery time of service unnecessarily long when one of the TiKV node encounters problem.
