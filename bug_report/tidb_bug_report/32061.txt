### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
drop table if exists t1,t2;
set @@collation_database = utf8mb4_bin ;
create table t1 (foo varchar(10)) collate= ascii_bin ;
insert into t1 (foo) values ("foo");
select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;

drop table if exists t1,t2;
set @@collation_database = latin1_bin;
create table t1 (foo varchar(10)) collate ascii_bin  ;
insert into t1 (foo) values ("foo");
select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;

drop table if exists t1,t2;
set @@collation_database = binary;
create table t1 (foo varchar(10)) collate ascii_bin ;
insert into t1 (foo) values ("foo");
select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;

drop table if exists t1,t2;
set @@collation_database = utf8_bin;
create table t1 (foo varchar(10)) collate ascii_bin ;
insert into t1 (foo) values ("foo");
select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
```mysql> select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;
+------+

+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;
+------+
| foo  |
+------+
| foo  |
| bar  |
+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;
+------+
| foo  |
+------+
| foo  |
| bar  |
+------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
mysql> select foo from t1 union select 'bar' as foo from dual;
+------+
| foo  |
+------+
| foo  |
| bar  |
+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
