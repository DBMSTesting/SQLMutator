in https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/26713, cases of ValueExpr and ParamMarkerExpr are handled(use converted int datum instead of origin string one), but the RowExpr is [left unchanged,](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/eab8700a53e2f2b2064d545ca566e804db7876df/pkg/planner/core/point_get_plan.go#L1102C13-L1102C20) which causes this problem.

Is it intentional?
