Title: Query SQL uses order by too slow
Description:
## Description
Hi all,
I have a query that uses `order by` and I think that it has run the `order by` clause for data of the table first, and then executed the query conditions in the `where` clause. Because the data is very large, so the time executed is too slow.

This is the result when I run to explain SQL:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    *
FROM
    account_log
WHERE
    account_id IN (1111)
    AND accounting_time >= 1604768400000
    AND accounting_time <= 1605286799000 
ORDER BY accounting_time ASC;
```
**About (30s)**
```
'└─IndexLookUp_23','0.00','root',''
'  ├─IndexScan_20','0.00','cop','table:account_log, index:accounting_time, range:[1604768400000,1605286799000], keep order:true'
'  └─Selection_22','0.00','cop','in(account_log.account_id, 1111)'
'    └─TableScan_21','0.00','cop','table:account_log, keep order:false'
```
Then, I try to run the query without using` order by`, the time executed is many times faster.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    *
FROM
    account_log
WHERE
    account_id IN (1111)
    AND  accounting_time >= 1604768400000
    AND accounting_time <= 1605286799000;
```
**About (45ms)**

```
'IndexLookUp_11','0.00','root',''
'├─IndexScan_8','0.00','cop','table:account_log, index:accounting_time, range:[1604768400000,1605286799000], keep order:false'
'└─Selection_10','0.00','cop','in(account_log.account_id, 1111)'
'  └─TableScan_9','0.00','cop','table:account_log, keep order:false'
```

Can you explain this problem and recommend another way to execute this query.
I am using TiDB version 3.012.
