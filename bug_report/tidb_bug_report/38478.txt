Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)


```sql
create table t1(a int, b int);
create table t2(a int, b int);
alter table t1 set tiflash replica 1;
alter table t2 set tiflash replica 1;
set @@tidb_opt_distinct_agg_push_down = 1;
```
case 1:
```sql
explain select /*+ read_from_storage(tikv[t1]) */count(distinct t2.a) from t1 join t2 on t1.b = t2.b;
```
case 2:
```sql
set @@tidb_allow_mpp=0;
explain select count(distinct t2.a) from t1 join t2 on t1.b = t2.b;
```
(sometimes you need to wait a moment or run them multiple times before the error appears)
### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Display the execution plan.

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)

```
ERROR 1815 (HY000): Internal : Can't find a proper physical plan for this query
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

master

This issue at least affects tidb from v6.0.0. TiDB before v6.0.0 should also be affected but I can't verify it on my machine.
