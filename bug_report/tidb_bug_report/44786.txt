`cast(int(1) as char)` will set `char.flen = 1`, which may truncate integers. We set `char.flen = 11` as mysql if we are casting integers.

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

```
CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
   `var` int(1) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin;
insert into t values(1,-1);
select id, var, cast(var as char) from t;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

```
id | var | cast(var as char)
-- | -- | --
1 | -1 | -1
```

### 3. What did you see instead (Required)


```
id | var | cast(var as char)
-- | -- | --
1 | -1 | -
```

### 4. What is your TiDB version? (Required)

v6.5.2
