Title: query from `information_schema.tikv_region_status` will fail if specific pd-server node down
Description:
When a query tries to fetch data from the `information_schema.tikv_region_status`, tidb-server will try to get the address of a pd-server node, and request from this node using http api.

The pd-server node is chosen is always the `pdHosts[0]`. When a pd-server node is marked down but not removed from the cluster, the address of this node will still be returned from the `pdClient`. This will cause the problem that tidb-server still tries to request from the pd-server node even if it is marked as down. Thus query may fail:
``` sql
> select region_id, group_concat(store_id order by store_id), group_concat(right(label ->> '$[0].value',1) order by label) from tikv_region_status join tikv_region_peers using (region_id) join tikv_store_status using (store_id) where db_name='test' and index_name='PRIMARY' group by region_id order by region_id;
