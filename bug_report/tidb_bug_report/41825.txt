Title: analyze is killed unexpected
Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
If one analyze stmt is killed by the global memory controller, the following analyze stmts on the same connection will be killed immediately.
We can reproduce this problem by modifying the unit test: TestGlobalMemoryControlForAnalyze
