Title: `select distinct` produces unexpected result
Description:
### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)
```sql
create table t1 (c1 int primary key);
insert into t1 (c1) values (575932053), (-258025139);

SELECT DISTINCT
  cast(c1 as decimal) as c3,
  cast(c1 as signed) as c4
FROM t1;
```

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)
The two columns should be same, in MySQL:
```
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT 
    ->   cast(c1 as decimal) as c3,
    ->   cast(c1 as signed) as c4
    -> FROM t1;
+------------+------------+
| c3         | c4         |
+------------+------------+
| -258025139 | -258025139 |
|  575932053 |  575932053 |
+------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
### 3. What did you see instead (Required)
But TiDB outputs strange number.
```
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT 
    ->   cast(c1 as decimal) as c3,
    ->   cast(c1 as signed) as c4
    -> FROM t1;
+------------+---------------------+
| c3         | c4                  |
+------------+---------------------+
| -258025139 | 1108209533567631369 |
|  575932053 |                   0 |
+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```
After removing `distinct`, the result is correct:
```
mysql> SELECT
    ->   cast(c1 as decimal) as c3,
    ->   cast(c1 as signed) as c4
    -> FROM t1;
+------------+------------+
| c3         | c4         |
+------------+------------+
| -258025139 | -258025139 |
|  575932053 |  575932053 |
+------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
