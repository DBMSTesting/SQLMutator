## Bug Report

### 1. What did you do?

See: https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/faq/tidb/#how-to-back-up-data-in-tidb
"How to back up data in TiDB?
Currently, the preferred method for backup is using the PingCAP fork of Mydumper. Although the official MySQL tool mysqldump is also supported in TiDB to back up and restore data, its performance is poorer than mydumper/loader and it needs much more time to back up and restore large volumes of data."

### 2. What did you expect to see?

There should be a mention of BR, even if mydumper is still the preference? I assume it is not.

### 3. What did you see instead?

Docs bug.

### 4. What version of TiDB are you using? (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)

Docs bug.
