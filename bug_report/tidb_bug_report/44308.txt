Description:
## Bug Report

Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!

### 1. Minimal reproduce step (Required)

Create 20 partitioned tables without data, each table has 60 columns and 2000 partitions.

### 2. What did you expect to see? (Required)

Since there is no data and statistics, no major change in memory usage.

TiDB memory usage increases abnormally and continues to increase after each truncate of these tables. Most of memory are taken up by statistics.PseudoTable.
