Title: pd-server listens on same port as etcd
Description:
## Bug Report

1. What did you do?

The pd-server listens on the same port as etcd (a common network service). This makes some sense since it embeds etcd, but the error messages when connecting to an etcd server by accident could be easier to understand.

2. What did you expect to see?

Something like:

```
[2019/12/24 14:42:40.062 -07:00] [WARN] [client.go:241] ["[pd] failed to get cluster id"] [url=http://127.0.0.1:2379] [error="Response to rpc request was invalid. Check that 127.0.0.1:2379 is a valid pd-server, and not an etcd server."]
```

3. What did you see instead?

```
[2019/12/24 14:42:40.062 -07:00] [WARN] [client.go:241] ["[pd] failed to get cluster id"] [url=http://127.0.0.1:2379] [error="error:rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = unknown service pdpb.PD target:127.0.0.1:2379 status:READY"]
```


4. What version of TiDB are you using (`tidb-server -V` or run `select tidb_version();` on TiDB)?
