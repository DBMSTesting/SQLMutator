Title: Fixup linux_arm64 extension builds
Description:
Reworked into a separate action `build_extensions_dockerized/action.yml, using the same action for linux_arm_gcc4 (in the Python workflow), linux_arm64 (first step in the LinuxRelease workflow) and linux_amd64.

This latest one has a problem in handling spatial, that I think will be handled by bumping to the more recent spatial, to be done in a separate PR.

Also minor rework in inverting the dependencies for LinuxRelease.yml, that allows to cut time to discover problems.
