Title: [Upsert] Fix use of RETURNING in combination with UPSERT (ON CONFLICT DO ...)
Description:
This PR fixes #15791

This branch is made from <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15927> as both of them touch the same code and needed partially the same changes.

The RETURNING result is now properly made to include each insert/update that gets made, instead of the optimistic approach that was taken before.
