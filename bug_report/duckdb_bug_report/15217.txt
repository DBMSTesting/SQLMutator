Title: `json_extract` Fails with Python 3.11.9 but Works with Python 3.11.0  
Description:
### What happens?

When running the same DuckDB query using Python 3.11.0 and Python 3.11.9, `json_extract` produces inconsistent results. Specifically, in Python 3.11.9, `json_extract('data', '/')` and `json_extract(t.test, '/')` both return `NULL`, while they work correctly in Python 3.11.0.  


### To Reproduce

**To Reproduce:**  

Run the following Python script using both Python 3.11.0 and 3.11.9:  

```python
import duckdb

query = duckdb.query("""
WITH t AS (
    SELECT '{ "hello": 1 }' AS test
)
SELECT
    t.test::json AS data,
    json_extract('data', '/') AS literal_extract,
    json_extract(t.test, '/') AS column_extract
FROM t;
""")
print(query)

```

**Observed Behavior:**  

**With Python 3.11.0:**  

literal_extract: {"hello": 1}
column_extract: {"hello": 1} 


**With Python 3.11.9:**  

literal_extract: `NULL`
column_extract: `NULL`
