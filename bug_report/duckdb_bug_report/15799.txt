Title: Fix map_extract backwards compatability
Description:
This PR is a follow-up from #14175 that changed the return value of `map_extract` and `element_at` to return a single value from maps by key instead of a list with the value.

This is a good change, but unfortunately It breaks backwards/forwards compatibility for serialized query plans. This PR fixes it by reverting the change to `map_extract` but instead add a new `map_extract_value` with the new behavior. It also changes the syntax sugar (e.g. `[]`) to use this new function instead, so the end user still "mostly" sees the new behavior, while the system internally still keeps the same behavior for the actual function.
