Title: fix and cleanup `flatten`
Description:
The issue stems from the fact that it's not enough to just look at the total vector size of the innermost element vector to size the resulting child/selection vector. If the inner list reference the same element(s) multiple times across different `list_entry`'s there are technically more "elements" than there are "values" in the innermost vector. So we need to do another pass across the input vector before to sum up the inner `list_entry` lengths first.

I also took the opportunity to cleanup and streamline the code somewhat. 

Closes #15921
