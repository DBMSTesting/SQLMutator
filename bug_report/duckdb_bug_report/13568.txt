Title: Add all CAPI functions to extension api for now
Description:
Cleans up the experimental C extension API by moving all functions into a v0.0.1 labeled struct for now. This also includes the deprecated functions which is useful as we want to be able to get started on a rust extension template  based on the C Extension API (https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-rs/issues/370), and DuckDB-rs still relies on some of this code (mostly the arrow part of the c api).

After this PR, we should be able to easily build an experimental rust extension template targeting the upcoming DuckDB v1.1.0 release. 

After we have a basic rust extension template set up, we should ideally finish stabilizing the C extension API for the DuckDB v1.2 release meaning that we can then start distributing forwards compatible c api extensions.
