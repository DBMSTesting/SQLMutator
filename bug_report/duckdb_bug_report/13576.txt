Title: [Arrow] HugeInt, UHugeInt, Bit, Time_TZ extensions
Description:
Hugeint is partially supported in the Arrow integration by defaulting to a `decimal(38,0)`. However, this can cause conversion errors and does not allow for proper round-tripping of this type.

To support both hugeint and uhugeint in Arrow, we export them using the `duckdb.hugeint` and `duckdb.uhugeint` extension names and use a fixed-size blob of 16 bytes as their internal format.

The disadvantage of this approach is that producers/consumers will have to implement our specific types.

In the future, we may want to revert to using decimals when we adopt the `VARINT` type as a decimal physical type.
