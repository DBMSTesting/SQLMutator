Title: CLI: Add `ctrll + \`  to insert a newline when editing multiline SQL.
Description:
We can currently edit multi-line SQL statements fluently in the DuckDB CLI, which is a great feature. However, if I want to add a new line to the multi-line SQL, I can't simply use `Shift + Enter` (as supported in most modern apps) to insert a newline at the current cursor position. Therefore, I think adding `Ctrl + \` to `Linenoise` for inserting a newline would be a great enhancement.

`Ctrl + \` in ASCII is represented by decimal 28, which is the file separator. I believe we won't use the file separator in command-line usage. 
Other alternative keys for inserting a newline could also be considered:

`Ctrl + ]` (ASCII decimal 29, group separator)
`Ctrl + ^` (ASCII decimal 30, record separator)
`Ctrl + _` (ASCII decimal 31, unit separator)

I prefer Ctrl + \ because: It is close to `Enter`. Mentally,`\` resembles adding \n for a newline.

However, any of the other keys would work as well.
