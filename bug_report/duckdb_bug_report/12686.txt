Title: Unexpected error raised by PRINTF
Description:
### What happens?

Updating a column using PRINTF raises `primary key constraint` and `Invalid Input` errors.

### To Reproduce

```sql 
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 VARCHAR, PRIMARY KEY(c0));
```
**Case one**
``` sql
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (-112498833);
UPDATE t0 SET c0=PRINTF(t0.c0);
```
```
Constraint Error: Duplicate key "c0: -112498833" violates primary key constraint. If this is an unexpected constraint violation please double check with the known index limitations section in our documentation (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/indexes).
```
**Case two**
``` sql
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('ay<L,%Ite');
UPDATE t0 SET c0=PRINTF(t0.c0);
```
```
Invalid Input Error: Argument index "0" out of range
```
I have reproduced these cases on the latest version of SQLite and did not encounter any problems.
