Title: [Fix ART] Correct prefix transformation
Description:
The recent release introduced variable prefix sizes in indexes. To stay forwards compatible with older DuckDB versions, we currently still transform prefixes to their deprecated length when persisting a DB. The bug was caused by prefixes exceeding the `DEPRECATED_COUNT` of 15 bytes.

Most scenarios would take the `fast path` (`prefix size <= DEPRECATED_COUNT`) in `Prefix::TransformToDeprecated`. Here, the non-fast path did not adjust the original node `node = new_node;`. Also, `ref` would reference the overwritten `ptr`.
