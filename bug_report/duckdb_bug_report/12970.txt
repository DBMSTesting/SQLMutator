Title: Several hive partitioning fixes
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12921
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12588

This PR addresses some inconsistencies within the hive partitioning code

* `HivePartitioning::Parse` is now used everywhere where partitions are detected from the file. Previously the auto-type detection used different code which lead to inconsistencies
* `HivePartitioning::Parse` is rewritten to no longer use the regular expression - this fixes an issue where hive partitions would not be correctly detected in the top-level directory
* `HivePartitioning::GetValue` is added and used consistently when the actual values are requested - this fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12921
* Empty strings are now only parsed as `NULL` for non-varchar types (fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12588)
