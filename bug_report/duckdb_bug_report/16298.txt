Title: Problems when using the STDDEV_POP function
Description:
### What happens?

Inconsistency occurs when using the var_pop function. Query 1 and Query 2 should return the same result because the condition in having simulates three-valued logic. The result after the union of the three statements should be the same as that of Query 1, but the calculation results are inconsistent.
Specifically, the result of Query 1 contains two data items --[1.707825127659933, 0.5], while the result of Query 2 is -- [1.7078251276599332, 0.5000000000000003]

```
SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0
--[1.707825127659933, 0.5]
SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING ((t0.c0) IS NOT NULL) UNION ALL SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING (NOT ((t0.c0) IS NOT NULL)) UNION ALL SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING ((((t0.c0) IS NOT NULL)) IS NULL)
--[1.7078251276599332, 0.5000000000000003]
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE t0(c0 BOOLEAN DEFAULT(''));
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (5.97637006E8);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (true);
CREATE VIEW v0(c0) AS SELECT t0.rowid FROM t0 LIMIT 1883109883;
UPDATE t0 SET c0=760092610;
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (0.3130780357818306);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (137682420);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (1380418026);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (-919334645);
ANALYZE;
UPDATE t0 SET c0='QvK!';
UPDATE t0 SET c0=-16721701;
UPDATE t0 SET c0=false;
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (0.4470722472408909);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (0.15665104429876675);
CREATE INDEX i4 ON t0(c0 );

SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0;
--[1.707825127659933, 0.5]
SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING ((t0.c0) IS NOT NULL) UNION ALL SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING (NOT ((t0.c0) IS NOT NULL)) UNION ALL SELECT STDDEV_POP((+ t0.rowid)) FROM v0, t0 GROUP BY t0.c0 HAVING ((((t0.c0) IS NOT NULL)) IS NULL);
--[1.7078251276599332, 0.5000000000000003]
```
