Title:  DuckDB Build Failure in Alpine Linux Docker Image (host: mac M1)
Description:
### What happens?

While building a Image container alpine@latest
 Pip did not find the DuckDB library with the appropriate version, so pip started building it from source, but then the build failed.

Host system: Mac M1.

### To Reproduce

steps: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edraj/dmart.git && cd dmart/admin_scripts/docker
# either
podman build -t dmart -f Dockerfile
# or
docker build . -t dmart -f Dockerfile
```
output:

```
