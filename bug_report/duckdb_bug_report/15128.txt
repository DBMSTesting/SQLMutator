Title: INTERNAL Error: Failed to bind column reference
Description:
### What happens?

Running the query (below) fails with the error message:

> INTERNAL Error: Failed to bind column reference "row_id" [44.0] (bindings: {#[57.0], #[57.1], #[57.2], #[57.3], #[57.4]}) This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.

### To Reproduce

It can probably be reduced some more, but here's a smallish example where I'm encountering the error:

```sql
with

grid as (
    from (values ('ABC'), ('DEF')) as v(data)
    select
        unnest(split(data, '')) as letter,
        row_number() over () as row_id,
        generate_subscripts(split(data, ''), 1) AS col_id,
),

search(row_i, col_i, letter_to_match) as (
    values (0, 0, 'A'), (0, 1, 'B'),
)

from (from grid cross join search) as grid_searches
select exists(
    from grid as grid_to_search
    where 1=1
        and grid_searches.row_id = grid_to_search.row_id + grid_searches.row_i
        and grid_searches.col_id = grid_to_search.col_id + grid_searches.col_i
        and grid_searches.letter_to_match = grid_to_search.letter
)
```

I'm happy to provide an explanation of what this intends to do, if needed
