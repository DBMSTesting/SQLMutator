Title: Scalar macro default params
Description:
Super open to feedback!

Adding default parameters to scalar macros defined as a DefaultMacro. I created an arbitrarily named function to test this feature, as the main use case is for community extensions. Happy to remove, adjust, or add a function where we truly want a default!

This does change the API of DefaultMacro, so any extension using it will have to update their list of functions.
