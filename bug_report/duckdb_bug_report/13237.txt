Title: CLI - incorrect decimal representation in ".mode insert"
Description:
### What happens?

Decimals are being represented incorrectly in ".mode insert". It looks like there is an implicit cast to `float`.

### To Reproduce

```
create table t (a decimal(38,18));
insert into t values (3.14), (2.71);

from t;
```

Output (decimals are precise):
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│          a           │
│    decimal(38,18)    │
├──────────────────────┤
│ 3.140000000000000000 │
│ 2.710000000000000000 │
└──────────────────────┘

```

```
.mode insert

from t;
```

Output (decimals are imprecise):
```
INSERT INTO "table"(a) VALUES(3.1400000000000001243);
INSERT INTO "table"(a) VALUES(2.7099999999999999644);
```
