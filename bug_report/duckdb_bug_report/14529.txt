Title: std::bad_cast raised when getting file from s3
Description:
### What happens?

I am trying to read files from s3 and I'm getting the following error `Invalid error: std::bad_cast`.

### To Reproduce

Here is an example of a session:
```
D INSTALL aws; LOAD aws; LOAD httpfs;
D CREATE SECRET (TYPE S3, PROVIDER credential_chain, CHAIN 'sso', PROFILE 'prod', REGION 'us-west-1');
D SELECT * from read_csv('s3://my-bucket/my-file');
Invalid Error: std::bad_cast
```
