Title: Update flaky return_files.test
Description:
Even when PER_THREAD_OUTPUT is set to true, the number of files written with `COPY TO` may not match the number of threads as described in  a [comment here](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/527f651b6939247fb3a8486e84140f795a73581b/test/sql/copy/per_thread_output.test#L24-L27). 
Therefore, I updated the return_files test to check if the number of rows are correct and at least one file has been written.
