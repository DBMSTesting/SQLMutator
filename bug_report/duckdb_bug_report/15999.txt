Title: Python: Parquet KV_METADATA writing issue (possibly general struct-packing issue) WRT apostrophes in strings
Description:
### What happens?

Attempting to write Parquet KV_METADATA with string values containing apostrophes from Python fails.  This might be a symptom of a general issue in the struct-packing happening in the course of this.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect()
meta = {
    'foo': "'bar'"
}
conn.sql(f"COPY (SELECT 1 foo) TO 'foo.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET, KV_METADATA {meta});")
```

This results in:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ParserException                           Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[9], line 7
      3 conn = duckdb.connect()
      4 meta = {
      5     'foo': "'bar'"
      6 }
----> 7 conn.sql(f"COPY (SELECT 1 foo) TO 'foo.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET, KV_METADATA {meta});")

ParserException: Parser Error: Unsupported expression in option list: main.struct_pack(foo := "'bar'")
```

If I remove the apostrophes, so the dict becomes `{ 'foo': "bar" }` (or `{ 'foo': 'bar' }`, for that matter), things work as expected.  In fact, a single apostrophe in a string suffices to trip up the subsequent DuckDB call.
