Title: Make binder expression depth limit use `max_expression_depth`
Description:
Follow-up on https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/8224

Rather than using a different setting in the binder - we use the same setting we use elsewhere (`max_expression_depth`) - providing a better error message and allowing this to also be adjusted. In addition this raises the limit from a default of 128 to 1000.

We also fix an issue with binding macros where we would keep a lot of stuff on the stack for every recursion, leading to quicker stack overflows, which is why the limit was so low to begin with. We fix this by moving the unfolding to a separate function (`UnfoldMacroExpression`) which allows us to clean up the temporary stack variables rather than keeping them around.
