Title: Require `capacity` in ValidityMask
Description:
This PR modifies the `ValidityMask` so it requires a capacity. The capacity can then be used to verify that accesses to the validity mask are in range. Note that this was already partially present (`target_count`). In debug mode we verify that all accesses to the validity mask are `< capacity`.
