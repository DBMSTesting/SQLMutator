Title: Fix #15602: also add unsatisfiable filters to the set, and propagate unsatisfiability up more
Description:
Fix #15602

The issue was that the `FilterCombiner` would correctly determine the filter was unsatisfiable:

```sql
c0 >= 1 AND c0 <= t0.c1 AND t0.c1 <= 0;

-- this means c0 >= 1 AND c0 <= 0, which cannot hold
```

However, it would return `UNSATISFIABLE` and then drop the filter. In most cases the upper layer would then prune the entire plan, but in certain code paths the `UNSATISFIABLE` condition is ignored. This PR fixes the issue by propagating up the `UNSATISFIABLE` result in more cases, and not dropping the filter in case an unsatisfiable filter is found (just in case the plan is not pruned).
