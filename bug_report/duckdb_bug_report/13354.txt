Title: [Metrics] Add `CUMULATIVE_ROWS_SCANNED` and `OPERATOR_ROWS_SCANNED`
Description:
This PR adds two operator metrics `OPERATOR_ROWS_SCANNED` and `CUMULATIVE_ROWS_SCANNED` which return the number of rows scanned in table scan operators, and the cumulative rows scanned of all the child nodes respectively. In operators that do not perform a scan, `OPERATOR_ROWS_SCANNED` will be 0.
