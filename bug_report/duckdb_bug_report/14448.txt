Title: [Dev] Further optimize the CDC ValidityMask deserialization
Description:
This PR implements the suggestion made by [Richard](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14416#discussion_r1805481889)

When a `validity_t` is used for < `ValidityMask::BITS_PER_VALUE` values, the least significant bits are set, i.e if `ValidityMask::BITS_PER_VALUE` was 8

5 values uses :
`xxx4 3210`

For that we can construct the mask:
`0001 1111`

To check that all bits are set for those values

Given that `ValidityMask::BITS_PER_VALUE` is 64, we save 1<=n<64 function calls by doing this
