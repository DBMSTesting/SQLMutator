Title: [Dev] Fix pyodide test failures
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/4079

Same change as <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15448> but for some reason (not sure what those are) Pyodide build doesn't use the `requirements-dev.txt` so this change has to be made here separately.
