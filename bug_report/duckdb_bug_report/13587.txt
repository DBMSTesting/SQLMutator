Title: reformat internal string functions
Description:
First step in gradually homogenizing the internal functions, only containing the string functions.

**Main changes**
- The homogenized internal functions now have the same structure as the core functions.
- The headers of the homogenized functions are created by `scripts/generate_functions.py` and only have method `GetFunction()`. This script now creates the headers of both the core functions and the part of the internal functions that have been converted. The script also creates the listings in `src/functions_core/function_list.cpp` and `src/functions_internal/function_list.cpp`
- Other public methods and attributes of function structs are now independent and have been moved to `src/include/duckdb/functions_internal/scalar/string_common.hpp` or `src/common/string_util.cpp`

**Changes in folder structure**
- directory `src/function/scalar/string` has been moved to newly created directory `src/functions_internal/scalar/string`
- directory `src/core_functions` has been renamed to `src/functions_core` (so the function directories are alphabetically next to each other)
- directory `src/function` will continue to exist with sub-directories `cast`, `pragma` and `table`. Sub-directories `scalar` and `aggregate` will eventually fully move to  `src/functions_internal/`. Directory `src/function` kept its name to reduce impact because extensions depend on it.
