Title: `strptime` returns incorrect timestamp when reading year before day of year
Description:
### What happens?

When using `strptime` to read timestamps, if the timestamp string (and consequently the format string) has the year before the day of year, the resulting timestamp object will be incorrect and entirely disregard the day of year.

If the year appears after the day of year number, the resulting timestamp is correct.

### To Reproduce

The following two SQL queries in the `duckdb` CLI minimally reproduce the issue:

#### Correct timestamp returned 
```sql
select strptime('100 2024', '%j %Y');
```

#### Incorrect timestamp returned
```sql
select strptime('2024 100', '%Y %j');
```
