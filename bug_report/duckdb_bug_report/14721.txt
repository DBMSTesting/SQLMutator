Title: CLI: Add support for `.thousand_sep` and `.decimal_sep` 
Description:
This PR adds support for the `.decimal_sep` and `.thousand_sep` options that can be used in the CLI to configure how these are rendered. Note that this is only respected in `duckbox` mode currently. Example usage:

```sql
.decimal_sep ,
.thousand_sep _
SELECT 12345.6;
┌──────────────┐
│   12345.6    │
│ decimal(6,1) │
├──────────────┤
│     12_345,6 │
└──────────────┘
```

Note that there is one restriction - this currently does not work with nested types yet but only for numbers at the top-level.
