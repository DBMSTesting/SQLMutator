Title: [shell] UBIGINT is also an integer type
Description:
Fixes very minor problem, but making sure this is somewhat consistent makes sense.

Testcase:
```
.mode markdown
SELECT 1::UBIGINT, 1::BIGINT;
```
Should be rendered with the same alignment.

Arguably also VARINT needs to be handled there.
