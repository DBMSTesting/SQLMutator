Title: Confusing error message when creating a MACRO to parameterize the argument of read_csv_auto()
Description:
### What happens?

The SQL command:
```
CREATE MACRO read(fn) AS (SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(fn));
```
results in a Binder Error:
```
Table function "read_csv_auto" does not support lateral join column parameters - cannot use column "fn" in this context
```
The same issue arises with similar "read" functions, e.g. read_parquet.

It would be more helpful if the error message could suggest that the TABLE keyword is missing.


### To Reproduce

```
CREATE MACRO read(fn) AS (SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(fn));
```
