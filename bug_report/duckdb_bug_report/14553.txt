Title: [Python][Arrow] Cast to `py::bytes` when dealing with BLOB in filter pushdown
Description:
This PR fixes #14344 

I've also included a small change to TableFilter, using ToString is impossible when debugging, as `ToString("c0")` would complain about `c0` not being a `std::string`

DebugToString inserts a bogus default column name so the method can be called.
