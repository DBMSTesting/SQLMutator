Title: POSITIONAL JOIN failure
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following setup:
```sql
CREATE TABLE aa AS VALUES ({'a':1});
```
According to the docs, 'SELECT * from t1 POSITIONAL JOIN t2;' is valid.
It seems to follow that the following should be valid:
```sql
SELECT row_number() OVER () FROM aa POSITIONAL JOIN aa;
```
But it gives an error:

Binder Error: Duplicate alias "aa" in query!

~~Just as mysterious is that the query:~~

For comparison, note that
```sql
SELECT row_number() OVER () FROM aa POSITIONAL JOIN (FROM aa);
```

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│ row_number() OVER () │
│        int64         │
├──────────────────────┤
│                    1 │
└──────────────────────┘
```

~~So it would seem there are two separate errors here....~~


### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE aa AS VALUES ({'a':1});
SELECT row_number() OVER () FROM aa POSITIONAL JOIN aa;
SELECT row_number() OVER () FROM aa POSITIONAL JOIN (FROM aa);
```
