Title: [Explain] Add the `HTML` format for `EXPLAIN` statements
Description:
`EXPLAIN (FORMAT HTML) SELECT ...`

Will output (the source code of) an HTML page rendering the tree using [treeflex](https://dumptyd.github.io/treeflex/)

The final result will look something like this:

### Collapsing/Expanding Children

Every node that has at least one child will have a button underneath that can be used to collapse/expand the children.
By default all nodes are expanded.

The above output with a couple children collapsed looks more manageable:

### Jupyter

In the Python client, when using Jupyter, the `explain()` method of the `DuckDBPyRelation` will automatically use the HTML format and render the result using `IPython.display.HTML`:
