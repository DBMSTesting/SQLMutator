Title: File url scheme
Description:
Takes a stab at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13669 @djouallah

This PR adds support for [`file://` urls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme) to the LocalFileSystem.

It currently supports urls of 3 different formats:

- `file:/some/path` (host omitted completely)
- `file:///some/path` (empty host)
- `file://localhost/some/path` (localhost as host)

Note that the following is not supported because they are non-standard (and actually forbidden by the spec) formats:
- relative paths (`file:some/relative/path`)
- double-slash paths (`file://some/path`)

Additionally, we also don't support
- non-localhost hosts (`file://somehostsomewhere/some/path`)

For the non-standard formats we could consider implementing them anyway if they show up a lot.
