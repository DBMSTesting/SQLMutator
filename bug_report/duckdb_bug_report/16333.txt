Title: CLI ".rows" switches to columns view (same as ".columns")
Description:
### What happens?

Using `.rows` in the CLI switches to columns mode (the same behavior as `.columns`) instead of switching to the default, expected behavior.

### To Reproduce

Minimal reproducer (Using a new DuckDB CLI session):
```
.rows
FROM VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6) AS t(a,b,c);
```

A bit more explanatory of a typical use-case (Using a new DuckDB CLI session):
```
-- Default behavior (row-wise)
FROM VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6) AS t(a,b,c);
-- Observe bug: explicitly set to row-wise (this fails by going to columns instead)
.rows
FROM VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6) AS t(a,b,c);
-- Switch to columns (nothing changes) then try to switch back (also doesn't work)
.columns
FROM VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6) AS t(a,b,c);
.rows
FROM VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6) AS t(a,b,c);
```
