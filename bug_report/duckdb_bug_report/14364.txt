Title: Please disable the jemalloc extension on FreeBSD by default
Description:
### What happens?

Issues like [this duckdb-node issue](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-node/issues/69) can occur.

Jemalloc is already a native allocator on FreeBSD. Adding external jemalloc module usually causes SEGVs because of various conflicts.

Please disable jemalloc by default so that people who would build DuckDB from the source tarball or the repository would get working DuckDB binaries.
