Title: DuckDB 1.1 on windows cannot load extension ?
Description:
### What happens?

Installing an extension makes DuckDB REPL stop.
Some extensions being loaded from .duckdbrc, nothing happened at first trial.
```
> duckdb.exe
v1.1.0 fa5c2fe15f
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D install spatial;
(duckdb terminates)
```

Is it related to changelog:

"Disable Windows extensions CI until Github actions runners are fixed" by @Mytherin #12479 

(I see it just before submitting...)

Tested with 
```
