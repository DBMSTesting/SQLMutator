Title: Support all types in `histogram` function
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12520

This PR uses the newly introduced decoding of sort keys to extend the `histogram` function to support all types. In addition, we do some clean-up by no longer using `Value` or `ListVector::PushBack` in the finalization of the histogram and instead directly appending to the underlying lists. This improves performance somewhat for larger histograms - but generally the (unordered) map insertions are still the bottleneck.

As the histogram function is also used internally by several list functions (e.g. `list_distinct`, `list_unique`) those functions now also support all types, e.g. this now works:

```sql
D select list_distinct([{'i': 42}, {'i': 84}, {'i': 42}]) AS result;
┌────────────────────────┐
│         result         │
│  struct(i integer)[]   │
├────────────────────────┤
│ [{'i': 84}, {'i': 42}] │
└────────────────────────┘
```
