Title: Creating Temporary Table in Schema Fails
Description:
### What happens?

After creating a new schema, trying to create a temp table in that schema results in a catalog error claiming the schema does not exist. If creating a normal (non-temp) table, the error does not occur.

### To Reproduce

Try the following in the online [DuckDB-WASM shell](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/overview.html):

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS s1;
CREATE TEMP TABLE s1.temp AS SELECT 1 AS foo;
```

The result is `Catalog Error: Schema with name s1 does not exist!`
