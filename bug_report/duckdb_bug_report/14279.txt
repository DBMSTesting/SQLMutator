Title: HTTP Proxy Error - Passwords Using Special Characters
Description:
### What happens?

**Background** - Issue #3836 was fixed by PR #13368 by including support for proxy environment variables. Love your work @samansmink 

**New problem** - In some operating environments users may be using [encoded special characters](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) when storing their proxy password (e.g., in Windows User Environment variables). For example, `FreeTheDucks@47` might be stored as `FreeTheDucks%4047`. In such cases, duckdb will return an error when attempting to reach the internet using `FreeTheDucks%4047`, which may include errors such as:

`duckdb.duckdb.HTTPException: HTTP Error: Failed to download extension "httpfs".`

**Temporary work-arounds to explore** - Use only special characters that do not require encoding (confirmed, this works). Have a separate environment variable for your proxy password that does not include encoding and have duckdb call for that environment variable instead of your encoded one (have not tested that this works since the special character when unencoded might cause some other issues).

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

# create in-memory db
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# retrieve proxy credentials from environment variable (or anywhere)
proxy_addr = 'my-proxy.domain.com'  # hypothetically could be retrieved by os.getenv('HTTP_PROXY_ADDR')
proxy_user = 'happyduck'

# this will NOT work
proxy_pass = 'FreeTheDucks%4047'  # Instead of the unencoded actual password, which would be FreeTheDucks@47

# this WILL work where encoding is not present or (in most environments) even required
# proxy_pass = 'FreeTheDucks-47'

# pass proxy credentials
con.execute(f"""
    SET http_proxy='{proxy_addr}';
    SET http_proxy_username='{proxy_user}';
    SET http_proxy_password='{proxy_pass}';
""")

# add extensions
con.execute(f"""
    INSTALL httpfs;
    INSTALL aws;

    LOAD httpfs;
    LOAD aws;
""")

# pass aws credentials
con.execute(f"""
    CREATE SECRET ( TYPE S3, PROVIDER CREDENTIAL_CHAIN, CHAIN 'env' );
""")
```
