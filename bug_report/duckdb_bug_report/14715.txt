Title: [Attach][Macro] Fix issues identified with an attached macro
Description:
https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3368

1. `query_table` was fully quoting the entire path, because of this it couldn't support qualified paths. We now use `QualifiedName::Parse` to extract the path and then stringify this appropriately (quoting where necessary)
2. `Bind(TableFunctionRef &ref)` did not bind the schema/catalog, so it was mistakenly treating `checksum_macro` (from the test) as the schema instead of the catalog.
