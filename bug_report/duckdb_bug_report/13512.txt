Title: Decimal division is not supported and a floating point fallback is used instead
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB gives inaccurate result when a decimal is divided by a decimal

### To Reproduce

To reproduce, run below query on DuckDB and Athena. Athena's result matches with the results from a scientific calculator but DuckDB result does not.
```sql
select (CAST('2400000.0' AS DECIMAL(38,15)) / CAST('0.95' AS DECIMAL(38,15)));
```

| tool | result |
|--|--|
Athena/Scientific Calculator | 2526315.789473684**210526**
DuckDB | 2526315.789473684**5**
Postgres | 2526315.789473684**210526** |

I have used explicit casting to avoid default casting to double. 
We have a use case where we need the precision and scale as (38,15)
