Title: [Upsert] Fix issues surfaced by mixing in virtual columns
Description:
This PR fixes #13471

Virtual columns are not at play in INSERT statements, they are calculated later. Because of this we need to base our indices off of PhysicalIndex rather than LogicalIndex.

- Use PhysicalIndex in the ON CONFLICT binding logic
- Get the types+names from the Physical columns when creating the base table binding for the "excluded" table referenced by the DO UPDATE SET expressions.
