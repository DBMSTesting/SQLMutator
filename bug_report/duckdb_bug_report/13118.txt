Title: Prefer aliases over column-value functions in `GROUP BY`, and prefer error message when alias is used in an expression
Description:
Fixes an issue where column-value functions (such as `user` or `current_timestamp`) were preferred over aliases in a `GROUP BY`, causing odd behavior. In addition, this PR also improves the error message in case an alias is used in an expression in a `GROUP BY` which is not supported.
