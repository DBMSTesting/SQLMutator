Title: `USE` does not affect for the table referenced after the keyword ON for the `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ON ...`
Description:
### What happens?

The `USE` command does not affect for the table referenced after the keyword ON for the `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ON ...` statement.

```sql
create schema mydb;
use mydb;
create table mytable (i bigint primary key, s varchar(20) NOT NULL);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX mytable_s ON mytable(s NULLS FIRST);
```
```
Catalog Error: Table with name mytable does not exist!
Did you mean "memory.mydb.mytable"?
```

This issue occurs in both `duckdb` command line and go-duckdb.

### To Reproduce

create table mytable (i bigint primary key, s varchar(20) NOT NULL);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX mytable_s ON mytable(s NULLS FIRST);
