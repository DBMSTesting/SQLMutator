Title: proposed enhancements to the query graphs
Description:
(first: thanks for making the query graph tool!)

Query graphs are a useful tool to study the shape and the performance of query plan. This PR modifies the visualization in order to allow a quick understanding of where performance is spent (using color). I also now extract some relevant info (how much do estimated vs. real cardinality differ?,  how wide were the produced tuples?)

the proposed optimizations are:

- modified the colors of the nodes to indicate the percentage taken (darker means that the operator takes more time). This makes it easy to see where performance is going

- extract the following info: (time, cardinality, estimated, width) and display that in the operator

- move all other extra info to the tooltips to get a less cluttered view
