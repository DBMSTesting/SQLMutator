Title: [Python Dev] No longer trigger a DeprecationWarning when using a UDF
Description:
This PR fixes #16370

Numpy has deprecated access to `numpy.core` in 2.0.0, we need to make sure `multiarray` does not get imported by a non-main thread for the first time, as this causes a segfault.

`multiarray` is sadly not exposed through the public API, so we kind of jump through a couple hoops to not trigger the warning anymore, while still remaining backwards compatible.

What does scare me a little is that I did not run into the DeprecationWarning during testing, so I wonder if accessing `multiarray` in this roundabout fashion is taking the right path, if it's not then we could still run the risk of running into the aforementioned segfault.
