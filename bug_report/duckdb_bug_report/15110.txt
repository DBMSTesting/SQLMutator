Title: Invalid Input Error Type mismatch for SET OPERATION in UNION statement
Description:
### What happens?

Using version 1.1.3 I execute the following statement:
```
create or replace table xx as select w from (values ('a'),('b'),('c'),('d'),('e')) t(w);

select w from (from xx limit 4) -- with 'limit 3' it works!!
CROSS JOIN (select 1 as f1) p
WHERE
     w IN (
        SELECT 'a'
        UNION -- with 'UNION ALL' it works also using 'limit 4'
        SELECT 'b'
        UNION
        SELECT 'c' WHERE p.f1 = 1
        UNION
        SELECT 'd' WHERE p.f1 = 1
);
```
This throws the following error:
```
Invalid Input Error: Type mismatch for SET OPERATION.
```
I've verified that this also occurs in v1.1.0, but it doesn't reproduce in v1.0.0.

### To Reproduce

```
create or replace table xx as select w from (values ('a'),('b'),('c'),('d'),('e')) t(w);

select w from (from xx limit 4) -- with 'limit 3' it works!!
CROSS JOIN (select 1 as f1) p
WHERE
     w IN (
        SELECT 'a'
        UNION -- with 'UNION ALL' it works also using 'limit 4'
        SELECT 'b'
        UNION
        SELECT 'c' WHERE p.f1 = 1
        UNION
        SELECT 'd' WHERE p.f1 = 1
);
```
