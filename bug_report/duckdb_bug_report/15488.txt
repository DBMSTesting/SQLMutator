Title: Re-enable some tests, removing `mode skip` or moving it later
Description:
Tests touched:
* test/sql/storage/commit_index_deletes.test -> indexes rework to make them more flexible (and more standard compliant)
* test/sql/storage/commit_abort_medium.test -> indexes, see above
* test/sql/storage/commit_abort_large.test_slow -> indexes, see above
* test/sql/insert/insert_from_many_grouping_sets.test -> test was removed due to thread sanitizer failures that are apparently gone (hard to say where, but plently of bugfixes went in)
* test/sql/aggregate/aggregates/test_count.test -> apparently COUNT DISTINCT was supposed to throw InternalError, now working
* test/optimizer/pushdown/table_or_pushdown.test -> adapting to new formatting, to NULL last instead of first, and re-enabling all but 2 tests (to be reviewed separately)

This is minor, but given they appear to work as intended (modulo some minor changes due to bit-rot), it's better to have them enabled.
