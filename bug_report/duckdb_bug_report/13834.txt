Title: Segmentation fault when upgrading from `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0`
Description:
### What happens?

While upgrading our `duckdb` runtime from `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0`, we are getting a segfault : 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f4d27f5-7477-4e9c-af17-baac162ef23f)

Our script is used through a cli command `duckdb` and uses a lot of `.read` statements into `duck.sql` sql file:

```sql
.read sql/load_node_country.sql
.read sql/load_node_gh_repository.sql
.read sql/load_node_gh_team.sql
```

then we load the file this way : 

```sh
duckdb data-quality.duckdb < duck.sql
````

When we play the sql files manually it works, but when we do the cli ways ot breks with a segfault.

ℹ️ Reverting to `v1.0.0` makes things run as usual.
