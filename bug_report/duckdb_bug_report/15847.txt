Title: Allow the cpptrace library to generate stacktraces
Description:
On Linux, when using DuckDB as a shared library integrated with other runtimes (e.g., golang) you don't get the stacktrace with file, function and line numbers. The `cpptrace` library helps with that. The default configuration works with `libgcc unwind`, `libdwarf` for symbols and `cxxabi` for demangling.

To use cpptrace, set `CMAKE_VARS` to `"-DDUCKDB_CPPTRACE=1"`. You should use the `reldebug` target (or set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to RelWithDebInfo`) to ensure debug symbols are generated.
