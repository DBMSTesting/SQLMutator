Title: Performance issue with SET VARIABLE
Description:
### What happens?

The same request wrapping with the setting of a variable is way longer than the same request without the SET VARIABLE. I found it on a large duckdb database stored in our buckets but I manage to reproduce it with a simple example.
I find a workaround when trying to debug it, it s to use EXPLAIN ANALYSE

### To Reproduce

code to reproduce:
```
SET enable_profiling TO 'no_output';
create table test as select range(10000000) as i;

.timer on
SELECT i
FROM test
WHERE i = null
LIMIT 1;

SET VARIABLE var_test = (
    SELECT i
    FROM test
    WHERE i = null
    LIMIT 1
);

EXPLAIN ANALYSE
SET VARIABLE var_test = (
    SELECT i
    FROM test
    WHERE i = null
    LIMIT 1
);
```
output:
```
D .timer on
D SELECT i
  FROM test
  WHERE i = null
  LIMIT 1;
Run Time (s): real 0.004 user 0.000000 sys 0.003315
D 
D SET VARIABLE var_test = (
      SELECT i
      FROM test
      WHERE i = null
      LIMIT 1
  );
Run Time (s): real 0.050 user 0.065433 sys 0.032705
D 
D EXPLAIN ANALYSE
  SET VARIABLE var_test = (
      SELECT i
      FROM test
      WHERE i = null
      LIMIT 1
  );
Run Time (s): real 0.001 user 0.001275 sys 0.000000
```
