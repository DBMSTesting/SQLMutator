Title: Python 3 Linux builds: Use ubuntu 22 instead of ubuntu 20, also no fail-fast
Description:
Last few nights Linux builds have been failing, with cryptic errors like:
```
        gcc: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault signal terminated program cc1
        Please submit a full bug report, with preprocessed source.
        See <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla> for instructions.
```
I believe this to be due to some changes in the Ubuntu 20 runners images.

Using Ubuntu 22 seems to solve the problem.
For good measure adding `fast-fail: false` so that any specific platform do not shuts down the building of other platforms.
