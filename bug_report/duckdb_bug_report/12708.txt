Title: Partitioned write - keep only up until 100 files open, when this limit is exceeded close the file and create a new file if more data for this partition appears
Description:
This PR reworks the partitioned write to keep only a limited amount of files open. When the limit is exceeded the file is flushed to disk and closed. If new data then pops up for such a partition, we create a new file to write that new data to.

This avoids hitting open file limits and also reduces memory pressure when doing partitioned writes - as files will be fully closed and written to disk periodically instead of kept open until the write is finished.

This is particularly effective when combined with `ORDER BY <partition_keys>` - as when the partition keys are ordered we will not see the same partition key again after we have finished writing it. This allows for a fully streaming write. Previously we would still keep e.g. Parquet metadata of each file in memory until all data was handled - which can end up consuming a large amount of memory when writing many partitions.
