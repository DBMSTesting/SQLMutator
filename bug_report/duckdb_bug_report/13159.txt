Title: Ambiguous Name not reported as an error
Description:
### What happens?

When a binding with column names contains duplicate names (e.g. FROM (...) **r(a,a)**), this ambiguity is not reported as an error. Instead DuckDB just takes the first column with a given name.



### To Reproduce

```
select  a from (values (1,2)) r(a,a);
```

returns 
```
┌───────┐
│   a   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     1 │
└───────┘
```
