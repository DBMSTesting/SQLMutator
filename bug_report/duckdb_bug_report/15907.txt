Title: EXCLUDE is not disallowed for framed window functions that don't support it
Description:
### What happens?

All of the new non-aggregate window functions (except `dense_rank`) now use framing when an `ORDER BY` argument is provided, but they do not check whether unsupported `EXCLUDE` modifiers are present. 

### To Reproduce

The following queries should fail because the functionality is unsupported:

```sql
-- EXCLUDE in the OVER clause
SELECT 
	i,
	lead(i ORDER BY i // 2, i) OVER (
		ORDER BY i // 2
		ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING 
		EXCLUDE TIES
	) AS f,
FROM range(10) tbl(i)
ORDER BY i;

--EXCLUDE in a WINDOW clause
SELECT 
	i,
	lead(i ORDER BY i // 2, i) OVER w AS f,
FROM range(10) tbl(i)
WINDOW w AS (
		ORDER BY i // 2
		ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING 
		EXCLUDE TIES
	)
ORDER BY i;
```

This applies to all the new non-aggregate functions.
