Title: [CI] Invert operations on OSX.yml, deploying nightly artifacts before test
Description:
Currently there is some not yet identified error that makes so nightly run are broken for OSX, and that do not publish nightly artifacts to be tried.

This PR inverts this, given failure might be not relevant (say networking or other sources of noise).
