Title: [Dev] Remove redundant variable from SQLStatement
Description:
I was working on [this](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13193) and noticed this information was duplicated and could be problematic.

In the case of the mentioned issue it is problematic, because `n_param` says 1 while the `named_param_map` is empty.
