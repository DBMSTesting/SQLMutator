Title: Fix #13805: throw a more descriptive error message when an on-disk file is referenced using a replacement scan for an unsupported file format
Description:
Fixes #13805 

We now throw the following error:

```sql
select * from "CMakeLists.txt";
-- Binder Error: No extension found that is capable of reading the file "CMakeLists.txt"
-- * If this file is a supported file format you can explicitly use the reader functions, such as read_csv, read_json or read_parquet
```
