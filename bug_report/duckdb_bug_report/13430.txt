Title: [METRICS] Add `blocked_thread_time` Metric
Description:
This PR adds a new metric `BLOCKED_THREAD_TIME`.

Currently, this metric only counts time spent when a thread is blocked. In the future, we would like to expand this to include all idle threads. 

In collaboration with @taniabogatsch.
