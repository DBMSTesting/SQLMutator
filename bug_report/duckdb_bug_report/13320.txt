Title: CAPI extensions: Fixup list of exported functions for wasm
Description:
There is a TODO connected to exporting only relevant extension API functions:
`    # TODO strip all symbols except the capi init`
That would require some minor re-factoring like having a list of exported functions and then generating from that the flags to be passed to compilers.

For now I fixed the Wasm version, so that it can be looked up/tested independently.
