Title: add duckdb_append_value to C API
Description:
Add `duckdb_append_value` to the C API.

I also added new C API tests of this function for all value types that it is currently possible to create. Six types don't yet have value-creation functions in the C API:
- DECIMAL
- MAP
- UUID
- UNION
- BIT
- VARINT

A [PR](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14613) exists to add value-creation functions for MAP and UNION. I plan to work on adding support for the other four types in the near future. I also plan to fill in the append-value test cases for these types after the necessary value-creation functions are added.

To enable the new tests, I added a few helpers to the C API tester:
- Get a chunk using `duckdb_fetch_chunk` instead of one of the deprecated chunk-fetching functions.
- Get the child vectors for LIST, STRUCT, or ARRAY vectors.

The new tests use direct access to the vectors instead of the C API tester's "Fetch" methods. This is because the "Fetch" methods use a (deprecated) path that doesn't support all types (`DeprecatedMaterializeResult`).
