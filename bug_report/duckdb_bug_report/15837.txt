Title: Inconsistent duplicate name error when reading nested JSON
Description:
### What happens?

Load a json array with nested object from file with read_json_auto.  If property names are the same but a different case, it handles duplicates in the first level of nesting but not the second level.

This works fine:
```
[
    {
        "id": "1",
        "Nest": {
            "test_variable": "value"
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "nest": {
            "test_variable": "value2"
        }
    }
]
```


But this one, `iss15837.json`, fails with error 

> 'Not implemented Error: Duplicate name "nest2" in struct auto-detected in JSON, try ignore_errors=true'


```
[
    {
        "id": "1",
        "nest":{
            "Nest2": {
                "test_variable": "value"
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "nest":{
            "nest2": {
                "test_variable": "value2"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
