**DuckDB with the nightly build** throws internal error with the ROUND and CAST function: `Information loss on integer cast: value -100.300000 outside of target range [-100.300003, -100.300003]`

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT ROUND(CAST(CAST('-100.3' AS DECIMAL(18, 1)) AS REAL), 1);
```

Output:
```
INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast: value -100.300000 outside of target range [-100.300003, -100.300003]
```

On stable version v1.0.0, the output is:
```
SELECT ROUND(CAST(CAST('-100.3' AS DECIMAL(18, 1)) AS REAL), 1);
