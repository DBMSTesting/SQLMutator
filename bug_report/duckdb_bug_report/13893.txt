Title: [Python] Fix issue related to the GIL when using `execute` with multiple statements
Description:
This PR fixes #13863 

When multiple statements are provided to `con.execute`, all the statements except the last one are "executed immediately", whereas the last statement goes through a slightly different path as prepared parameters might need to be injected before it gets executed.

The `ExecuteImmediately` path did not release the GIL before entering the bind+execution phase, which is what caused this error.
