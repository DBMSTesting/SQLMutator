Title: [Julia] Add support for named params in prepared statements
Description:
This PR adds support prepared statements with named parameters that use the DuckDB dialect:

```sql
-- Named
INSERT INTO test_table VALUES($col1, $col2)
-- Positional 
INSERT INTO test_table VALUES($2, $1)
```

Named parameters with `:col1` are still unsupported.

To stay consistent with the current interface, arguments provided as NamedTuples can be used as positional or named arguments.

```julia
# still works
DBInterface.execute(db, "SELECT * FROM temp LIMIT ?", (a = 3,))
```
