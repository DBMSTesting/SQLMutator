Title: Conflicting lock when using FastAPI/Uvicorn reload=True 
Description:
### What happens?

Unable to set lock due to conflict when running Fastapi/Uvicorn with reload=True. 

Error message:
>duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Could not set lock on file "/home/<user>/<path>/test.duckdb": Conflicting lock is held in /home/<user>/.pyenv/versions/3.9.16/bin/python3.9 (PID XXXX).

### To Reproduce

Causes the issue
```
from fastapi import FastAPI
import duckdb


app = FastAPI()
conn = duckdb.connect("test.duckdb")

@app.get("/")
async def home():
    return "Home"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run( "main:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=22222, reload=True)
