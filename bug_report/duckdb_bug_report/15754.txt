Title: Add `disabled_compression_methods` setting that can be used to disable certain compression methods
Description:
This setting is similar to `force_compression`, but does the inverse - it prevents a compression method from being selected.

Usage:

```sql
SET disabled_compression_methods='fsst';
SET disabled_compression_methods='fsst,rle';
```
