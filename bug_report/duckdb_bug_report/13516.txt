Title: Feature #1272: Windowed Quantile Tree
Description:
Use the new thread-safe Build method to parallelise tree construction. We can call it on every row because it has a quick exit and it is thread-safe.

This is the only custom window init function that
allocates a large data structure, so the PR effecively parallelises the construction step of custom windowed aggregates, and shows how to parallelise any future complex aggregates without any API changes.
