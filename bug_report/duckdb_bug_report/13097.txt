Title: TRY_CAST(1::BIT AS SMALLINT) throws error but docs say it should never do that.
Description:
### What happens?

TRY_CAST throws an error but the docs (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/expressions/cast#try_cast) say it shouldn't be doing that. 

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT try_cast(1::BIT as SMALLINT);
```

output:

```
Conversion Error: Bitstring doesn't fit inside of INT16
LINE 1: select cast(1::BIT as SMALLINT);
```

(similar call with USMALLINT, TINYINT and UTINYINT fail similarly)
