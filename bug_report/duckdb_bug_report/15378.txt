Title: Fix Test introduced by new sampling
Description:
Random seems to change behavior on CI vs. local every once in a while. E.g this test [passed](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14914/files#diff-11cce9af3b5b8ec371185eade3aa7839f9783270a63bc768e9b37ecfc3fb6ec5L221) when sampling was initially merged. I think a better long term fix is to just make sure the value is repeatable using the unittestci  features
