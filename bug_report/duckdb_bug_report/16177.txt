Title: Patching httpfs extension leads to Windows Extensions CI failure
Description:
### What happens?

When pushing to DuckDB with a patch to the httpfs extension, this triggers the Windows Extensions CI to fail.

Error message:

```

### To Reproduce

You can reproduce this issue by applying a very simple patch to the httpfs extension and then pushing this to DuckDB.

Example code (thanks to @carlopi)

```
cd path/to/duckdb-httpfs
git diff origin/main > path/to/duckdb/.github/patches/extensions/httpfs/sample.patch
cd path/to/duckdb
```

Then change `.github/config/out_of_tree_extensions.cmake` to 

```
duckdb_extension_load(httpfs
    LOAD_TESTS
    GIT_URL https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-httpfs
    GIT_TAG 85ac4667bcb0d868199e156f8dd918b0278db7b9
    INCLUDE_DIR extension/httpfs/include
    APPLY_PATCHES
    )
```

and push this
