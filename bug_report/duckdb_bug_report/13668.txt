Title: Option to disable jemalloc for linux builds
Description:
The `BUILD_JEMALLOC` flag was only being enforced on non-linux systems and even that is still architecture dependent. There was no way to prevent the jemalloc from being built/linked on linux as setting `BUILD_JEMALLOC=0` did not prevent it from being built. 

This PR explicitly checks if `BUILD_JEMALLOC` is set to 0 and passes a `CMAKE_VARS` that is used in extension_config.make to override and disable the criteria for building jemalloc.
