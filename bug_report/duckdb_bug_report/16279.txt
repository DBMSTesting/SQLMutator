Title: Fix heap buffer oveflow sampling
Description:

fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/16258

Issue was that actual table samples with a reservoir capacity size < `FIXED_SAMPLE_SIZE` would never be vacuumed because of the conditional in the `Vacuum()` function. Now during vacuuming we run some extra checks to make sure we vacuum even the small samples (like 100 rows).
