Title: add CORE_EXTENSIONS build flag
Description:
Simple PR adding a build flag which allows you to build an extension from the default extension config.

Now you can run:
`CORE_EXTENSIONS='aws;substrait;json;parquet' make` to build a mix of in-tree and out-of-tree extensions. The versions built for the out-of-tree extensions are the ones in `.github/config/out_of_tree_extensions.cmake`

This is convenient during development as before building an out of tree extension required copy pasting the config entry in an extension config.

This is also convenient for CI where we can easily build out-of-tree extensions from env variables in CI jobs. For example the BUILD_INET flags that https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13085 removes, can be added back in with this @chrisiou
