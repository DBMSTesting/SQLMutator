Title: View not created in default schema cannot be queried from other schema
Description:
### What happens?

If a view is not created in default schema and the relation name in view's definition is not qualified with its schema, the view cannot be queried in any other schema.

### To Reproduce

```sql
D create schema new;
D use new;
D CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT 42 AS i, 84 AS j;
D create view v as (select * from t1);
D select * from v;  -- ok
┌───────┬───────┐
│   i   │   j   │
│ int32 │ int32 │
├───────┼───────┤
│    42 │    84 │
└───────┴───────┘
D use main;
D select * from new.v;  -- error
Catalog Error: Table with name t1 does not exist!
Did you mean "new.t1"?
```
