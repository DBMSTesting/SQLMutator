Title: Fix type pushdown for Hive-partitioned CSV data.
Description:
While `SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS` can handle real Hive-partitioned CSV without duplicate partition column data in files, DuckDB currently throws an internal error (vector index error in type pushdown) when we try to import into an existing table with `INSERT INTO ... FROM read_csv()`. This PR fixes it through `INSERT INTO ... BY NAME`.
