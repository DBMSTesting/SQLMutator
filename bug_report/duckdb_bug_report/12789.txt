Title: list_zip does not support arrays (requires list)
Description:
### What happens?

If I pass in arrays as parameters to `list_zip`, I receive a binder error that their types must be list.

### To Reproduce

This works:
```sql
select list_zip([1, 2, 3]::int[], [1, 2, 3]::int[])
```

This does not work:
```sql
select list_zip([1, 2, 3]::int[3], [1, 2, 3]::int[3])
```
```
BinderException: Binder Error: Parameter type needs to be List
```
(Note that the error message is from running in Python, but the same error appears in the CLI also)
