Title: PARTITION_BY doesn't work with fsspec (Raises FileNotFoundError)
Description:
### What happens?

I'm trying to copy a table to a remote directory using fsspec. But I get FileNotFoundError when I use PARTITION_BY. I suspect PARTITION_BY doesn't use fsspec api for creating subdirectories, because it works without partitioning remotely and also works with partitioning locally.

### To Reproduce

Here's a snippet of using partitioning locally with fsspec. It works fine.


```python
import duckdb
import fsspec


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize and register fs
    fs = fsspec.filesystem("file", host="localhost")
    duckdb.register_filesystem(fs)

    # Cleanup ./data directory
    if fs.exists("data"):
        fs.rm("data", recursive=True)
    fs.makedir("data")

    # Read flights.csv data
    duckdb.sql(
        "CREATE VIEW 'flights' AS SELECT * FROM read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/flights.csv')"
    )
    
    # Export flights as partitioned parquet
    duckdb.sql(
        "COPY 'flights' TO 'file://./data' (FORMAT PARQUET, PARTITION_BY(YEAR), OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE 1)"
    )
```


When trying to do the same on remote (using ssh/sftp) FileNotFoundError is raised:

```python
import duckdb
import fsspec 


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize and register fs
    fs = fsspec.filesystem("ssh", host="remote_host")  # 'pip install sshfs' is required
    duckdb.register_filesystem(fs)

    # Cleanup ./data directory
    if fs.exists("data"):
        fs.rm("data", recursive=True)
    fs.makedir("data")

    # Read flights.csv data
    duckdb.sql(
        "CREATE VIEW 'flights' AS SELECT * FROM read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/flights.csv')"
    )

    # Pre-create partition directories. With this pre-process it works. Uncomment to fix
    
    # years = duckdb.sql("SELECT DISTINCT Year from 'flights'").df()
    # for year in years['year']:
    #     fs.makedirs(f"data/Year={year}", exist_ok=True)
    
    # Export flights as partitioned parquet
    duckdb.sql(
        "COPY 'flights' TO 'ssh://./data' (FORMAT PARQUET, PARTITION_BY(YEAR), OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE 1)"
    )
```

The script will work if uncomment the code which creates subdirectories explicitly. Without this block the code raises the following exception:
```
duckdb.duckdb.Error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

At:
  ...\venv\lib\site-packages\sshfs\utils.py(31): wrapper
```
