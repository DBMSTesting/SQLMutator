Title: Review no_extension_autoloading requires in tests: either remove, add FIXME or add EXPECTED
Description:
Added a way to inline explanations in the require clause, currently mandatory for `no_extension_autoloading`.

There is a pattern of adding comments above the require, but this makes it mandatory to have either a string starting with `FIXME: some text` or `EXPECTED: lorem ipsum`.
Behaviour is equivalent, but they should encode (to future devs) whether it's something that needs fixing and eventually be removed or it's needed for the test to actually make sense.

We could have infrastructure then to list the FIXME in the final report (or if a given flag is passed), or even just grep the test files.

While doing a pass, removed some instances of `require no_extensions_autoloading` that have been solved, and categorize either as FIXME or EXPECTED the others.

Note that changing SQLLogic parser might influence extensions tests (breaking them), but that's OK.

FIXME are currently related either to ICU types or functions not triggering autoloading or connected to ZSTD requiring parquet loaded (and not triggering autoloading).
