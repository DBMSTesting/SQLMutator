Title: Overture's address dataset's sources column struct raises internal error: Requested allocation size of # is out of range on Windows, WSL2 and VMs running on 14900K but not macOS or the Steamdeck
Description:
### What happens?

I'm getting one of the following issues after I run the SQL below:

```
Invalid Input Error: Malformed JSON at byte 105 of input: unexpected end of data.  Input: [{"property":"","dataset":"OpenAddresses/MAA-AM...
```

after a reboot I'm seeing the following:

```
Invalid Input Error: Malformed JSON at byte 115 of input: unexpected character.  Input: [{"property":"","dataset":"OpenAddresses/Addres...
```

Others I've spoken to whom are using the same version of DuckDB are able to run the query without issue for some reason: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues/208#issuecomment-2303084499

The dataset was produced with Sonoma 14.5.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT   country,
         COUNT(*) AS num_addrs,
         sources->0->'dataset' AS source
FROM     READ_PARQUET('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-08-20.0/theme=addresses/type=address/*.parquet',
                      hive_partitioning=1)
WHERE    country != 'US'
GROUP BY 1, 3
ORDER BY 1, 2 DESC;
```
