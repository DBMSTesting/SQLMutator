Title: The jemalloc extension doesn't get disabled even when it isn't in DUCKDB_EXTENSIONS
Description:
### What happens?

The [documentation](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/extension/README.md) says that the cmake variable BUILD_EXTENSIONS defines what extensions to build.

I excluded jemalloc from that list:
-DOVERRIDE_GIT_DESCRIBE=v1.1.1-0-g0000000000 -DBUILD_EXTENSIONS="autocomplete;fts;httpfs;icu;inet;json;parquet;sqlsmith;tpcds;tpch;sqlite_scanner"  -DDUCKDB_MAJOR_VERSION=1  -DDUCKDB_MINOR_VERSION=1  -DDUCKDB_PATCH_VERSION=1 -DBUILD_TPCE:BOOL=true -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING="cc"  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING="c++"  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-O2 -pipe  -fstack-protector-strong -fno-strict-aliasing "  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG:STRING="-O2 -pipe  -fstack-protector-strong -fno-strict-aliasing "  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE:STRING="-O2 -pipe  -fstack-protector-strong -fno-strict-aliasing  -DNDEBUG"  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-O2 -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -fno-strict-aliasing  -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/inet/src/include  -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/sqlsmith/src/include -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/sqlite_scanner/src/include "  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG:STRING="-O2 -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -fno-strict-aliasing  -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/inet/src/include  -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/sqlsmith/src/include -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/sqlite_scanner/src/include "  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE:STRING="-O2 -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -fno-strict-aliasing  -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/inet/src/include  -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/sqlsmith/src/include -I/usr/ports/databases/duckdb/work/duckdb-1.1.1/extension/sqlite_scanner/src/include  -DNDEBUG"  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING="  -fstack-protector-strong "  -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING="  -fstack-protector-strong "  -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING="  -fstack-protector-strong "  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="/usr/local"  -DCMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL:STRING="7"  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release"  -DTHREADS_HAVE_PTHREAD_ARG:BOOL=YES  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=YES  -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON  -DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED:BOOL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON -DBUILD_UNITTESTS:BOOL=OFF -GNinja

However, configure still attempts to enable jemalloc and looks for the jemalloc folder:
```
