Title: [Python] Use an `ArrowQueryResult` in `FetchArrowTable` when possible.
Description:
ArrowQueryResult can't be fetched incrementally, so this relies on the fact that the query is executed and the result is then fetched in its entirety.

This path will be used when `sql` was used to create a DuckDBPyRelation and `polars` or `arrow` was then used to fully consume the result into a polars DataFrame or a pyarrow ArrowTable respectively.
