Title: Misleading error message appender - not all columns appended
Description:
### What happens?

When using the appender (https://duckdb.org/docs/api/c/appender) and when appending an _insufficient_ number of columns, an error is raised.

The text of the error message thrown
```
InvalidInputException("Call to EndRow before all rows have been appended to!");
```
appears to be misleading, though, as it talks about rows, when columns are missing. It may be preferable to have
```
InvalidInputException("Call to EndRow before all columns have been appended to!");
```
or even
```
InvalidInputException("Call to EndRow before all columns of the row have been appended!");
```
