Title: Error message when omitting `from` could be friendlier
Description:
### What happens?

I ran a SQL query where I accidentally left out the `from` keyword. Here are the query and error:

```
D select count(*) '~/my_file.csv';
Parser Error: Expected a constant as type modifier
```

This error message was a bit unhelpful to me since I wasn't intending to use a type modifier (in fact, I don't know what that means).

To throw out a few suggestions, I could see:

- Making the error more generic since the root cause isn't improper use of a type modifier, at least from my perspective as a user ðŸ˜„ 
- The parser looks for the absence of `from` and gives a friendly tip, such as "Hint: did you forget a FROM clause?"

### To Reproduce

Run a query missing `from`, e.g.:

```
D select count(*) '~/my_file.csv';
```
