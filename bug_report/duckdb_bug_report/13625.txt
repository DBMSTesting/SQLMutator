Title: Newly imported tables not showing
Description:
### What happens?

Hello,

Newly imported CSV files **_sometimes_** won't show up in the table list. But I am able to query the tables in question. Both CLI and duckdb node packages have the same issue.

### To Reproduce

When I import a file using the command with duckdb node package:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ${tableName} AS SELECT * FROM read_csv('${filePath}');
```

Newly created table won't show up in the list when using one of the following queries both in CLI and node package:
```sql
SHOW ALL TABLES;
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;
```

But I can list table content using the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ${tableName};
```
