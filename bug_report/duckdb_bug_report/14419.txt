Title: `ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY`
Description:
This heavily builds on the great work of @frapa here: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11895.

It mainly addresses a few remaining issues:
- building the indexes in the row collections instead of the data tables
- creating both a global and local physical index inside transactions
- more tests

I still need to pass over a few things, and add WAL tests/support.
Will move this out of draft soon.
