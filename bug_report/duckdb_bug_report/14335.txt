Title: TABLE MACRO Overloading is not Working
Description:
### What happens?

citing the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/create_macro#overloading):

> It is possible to overload a macro based on the amount of parameters it takes, this works for both scalar and table macros.

I've tried to create an overload table macro as follows:
```
CREATE MACRO dynamic_table
(col1_value, col2_value) AS TABLE SELECT col1_value AS column1, col2_value AS column2,
(col1_value, col2_value, col3_value) AS TABLE SELECT col1_value AS column1, col2_value AS column2, col3_value as column3;
```
but i keep getting the following error:
` Parser Error: syntax error at or near ","`
but the macro is structure exactly like the specified overloaded macro on the documentation.
i also tried other solution but i'm unable to create an overloadable table macro.

### To Reproduce

```
CREATE MACRO dynamic_table
(col1_value, col2_value) AS TABLE SELECT col1_value AS column1, col2_value AS column2,
(col1_value, col2_value, col3_value) AS TABLE SELECT col1_value AS column1, col2_value AS column2, col3_value as column3;
```
