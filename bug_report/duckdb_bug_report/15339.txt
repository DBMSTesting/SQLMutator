Title: Use correct element rename_list_el in grammar
Description:
This was the actual definition used by the generated grammar - but somehow the generated grammar ended up differing from the checked in grammar. We should add the grammar to the generated files check. The only problem there is installing the correct version of flex/bison in the CI:

```
$ > bison --version
bison (GNU Bison) 2.3
