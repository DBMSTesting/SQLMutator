Title: Issue 14151: Fix conflicting defines on Windows hidden by cmake unity builds
Description:
These two changes fix builds that don't use cmake unity described in issue #14151

1. Remove header inclusion guard in windows_undefs.hpp to insure certain Win32 macros are always undefined - this is okay because all these #undef are guarded by `#ifdef WIN32`

2. Copy deletion of ICU undefine of `__STRICT_ANSI__` from ICU upstream that conflicts with GCC-14 header files - this duplicates https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/3003 - it would be better to pull the latest ICU in but ICU is used in a customized way that would require more effort - also looks like fix won't be released till ICU 75.2 which is not yet released - https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22721
