Title: INNER JOIN returns inconsistent results
Description:
### What happens?

When I run the following inner join I get inconsistent results. This has occured with the CSV files as seen below and with trying to join a csv file with a sqlite database.

```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM media_filenames.csv m
    INNER JOIN media_filenames_2.csv c 
    ON m.filename = c.filename
    where m.filename is not Null and c.filename is not Null;
```
```
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│      1395487 │
└──────────────┘
```
```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM media_filenames.csv m
    INNER JOIN media_filenames_2.csv c 
    ON m.filename = c.filename
    where m.filename is not Null and c.filename is not Null;
```
```
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│      1394553 │
└──────────────┘
```
```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM media_filenames.csv m
    INNER JOIN media_filenames_2.csv c 
    ON m.filename = c.filename
    where m.filename is not Null and c.filename is not Null;
```
```
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│      1394913 │
└──────────────┘
```

### To Reproduce

Run the following SQL query on the linked CSV files

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM media_filenames.csv m
INNER JOIN media_filenames_2.csv c 
ON m.filename = c.filename
where m.filename is not Null and c.filename is not Null;
```
