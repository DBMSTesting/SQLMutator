Title: fix: make ArrowArrayWrapper::GetNextChunk() virtual 
Description:
I'd like to throw a custom exception rather than the one that is generated by `arrow_scan` if an error happens when scanning Arrow data, without this method being marked as `virtual` I cannot override it in a subclass.

Can we please get this in the bug fix release?
