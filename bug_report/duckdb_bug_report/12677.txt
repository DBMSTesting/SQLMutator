Title: [CLI] Limit history size to 100MB, and avoid writing invalid UTF8 to the CLI history
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12350

This PR addresses the issues raised there by:

(1) limiting the amount of bytes read from the history file. If we encounter more than 100MB a warning will be printed and loading of the history file will be aborted, e.g.:

```bash
export DUCKDB_HISTORY=/Users/myth/Programs/duckdb/taxi.db   
build/reldebug/duckdb
# History file "/Users/myth/Programs/duckdb/taxi.db" exceeds maximum history file size of 100 MB - skipping full load
```

(2) prevents adding invalid UTF8 to the history entirely, and skips reading invalid UTF8 during history deserialization. This prevents issues where e.g. calling `.read <bigbinary>` will pollute the history with garbage.
