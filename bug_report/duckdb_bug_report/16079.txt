Title: Newline confusion & regexp_full_match not matching certain rows
Description:
### What happens?

As far as I can tell, there are two issues:

- Newlines seem to be treated/stored differently in two different insertions (see below)
- Perhaps this is normal/expected behavior, but I assume that, regardless, `.*` should match both of them

Any help about what's going on here and what I *should* be doing would be appreciated. Also, if we really have to escape newlines as `\n` then I guess this means that all backslashes need to be escaped as `\\` is that right?

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE Test (txt TEXT);
INSERT INTO Test (txt) VALUES ('test1\ntest1');
INSERT INTO Test (txt) VALUES ('test2
test2');
SELECT * FROM Test;
```
```
┌──────────────┐
│     txt      │
│   varchar    │
├──────────────┤
│ test1\ntest1 │
│ test2\ntest2 │
└──────────────┘
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM Test WHERE txt SIMILAR TO '.*';
```
```
┌──────────────┐
│     txt      │
│   varchar    │
├──────────────┤
│ test1\ntest1 │
└──────────────┘
```
