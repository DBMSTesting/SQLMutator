Title: Date Difference Discrepancy in DuckDB
Description:
### What happens?

There appears to be a discrepancy in the way DuckDB calculates the difference between two dates in weeks compared to SQL Server.
When calculating the difference in weeks between '2023-01-22 05:30:00+05:30' and '2024-09-13 05:30:00+05:30', the expected result is 85 weeks, as observed in SQL Server. DuckDB returns 86 weeks for the same calculation.


### To Reproduce

SQL Server
```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(week, CAST('2023-01-22 05:30:00+05:30' AS DATETIMEOFFSET), CAST('2024-09-13 05:30:00+05:30' AS DATETIMEOFFSET));
```
```
Result: 85
```
DuckDB
```sql
SELECT date_diff(
    'WEEK',
    '2023-01-22 05:30:00+05:30'::timestamptz,
    '2024-09-13 05:30:00+05:30'::timestamptz
) AS column;
```
```
Result: 86
```

Questions

1. Is this difference in behavior expected?
2. If not, can DuckDB's behavior be made compatible with SQL Server?
3. If it is expected, could you please explain the reasoning behind DuckDB's calculation method?
