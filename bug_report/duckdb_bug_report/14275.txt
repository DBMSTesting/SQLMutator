Title: Cannot alias current_timestamp to "current_timestamp"
Description:
### What happens?

Little strange here, but noticed this broke with the 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1 change, using the `current_timestamp` keyword aliased to `"current_timestamp"` throws an error

on v1.1.1 af39bd0dcf
```
D select current_timestamp as "current_timestamp";
Binder Error: Column "current_timestamp" referenced that exists in the SELECT clause - but this column cannot be referenced before it is defined
```

on v1.1.0 fa5c2fe15f
```
D select current_timestamp as "current_timestamp";
┌────────────────────────────┐
│     current_timestamp      │
│  timestamp with time zone  │
├────────────────────────────┤
│ 2024-10-08 09:07:08.335-07 │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

Notably postgres allows this: 
```
test=# select current_timestamp as "current_timestamp";
       current_timestamp       
-------------------------------
 2024-10-08 16:04:24.472592+00
