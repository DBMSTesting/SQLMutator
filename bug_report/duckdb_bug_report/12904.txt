Title: DuckDB ~/.duckdb_history can grow very large and prevent CLI from starting with 100% CPU usage
Description:
### What happens?

After executing a Multi-gig `.sql` file in the DuckDB CLI with the `.read file.sql` option my CLI hung, which is not a problem as it is huge.
But after quitting and trying to restart DuckDB it would not start anymore and show with close to 100% cpu usage in activity monitor. After searching for "tmp" files from duckdb I came across a 1.2G `~/.duckdb_history`. Deleting that file resolved the issue.

### To Reproduce

- Have a large `~/.duckdb_history` (Had 1.2G in my local)
- Try to start the duckdb CLI
- It will hang/take a long time to start.
