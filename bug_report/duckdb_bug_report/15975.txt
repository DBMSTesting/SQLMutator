Title: strip command breaks DuckDB extensions
Description:
### What happens?

## Description: 
We're experiencing issues using the `strip` command, which is used to remove debugging symbols from our binaries. When we run `strip` on our DuckDB extensions, it breaks the extensions and results in the following error:

`The file is not a DuckDB extension. The metadata at the end of the file is invalid`

## What is `strip` and its benefits:  
`strip` is a Unix command that removes debugging symbols from executable files, making them smaller and more efficient. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_(Unix)).

**The benefits of using `strip` include:**

* Reduced file size: By removing debugging symbols, `strip` can significantly reduce the size of executable files, making them easier to distribute and store.
* Improved performance: Stripped binaries can load faster and use less memory, resulting in improved performance.
* Enhanced security: By removing debugging symbols, `strip` can make it more difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer or exploit vulnerabilities in the code.

## Benefits of allowing `strip` on DuckDB extensions:  
It would be very beneficial to allow using `strip` over these binaries, as it would significantly reduce the size of the extensions. For example, the `httpfs` extension would be reduced in size from 46MB to 39MB, resulting in a 15% reduction in size.


### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("INSTALL HTTPFS")
```

```shell
strip ~/.duckdb/extensions/v1.1.3/linux_amd64_gcc4/httpfs.duckdb_extension
```

```python
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("LOAD HTTPFS")
```

error:
`duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Extension "~/.duckdb/extensions/v1.1.3/linux_amd64_gcc4/httpfs.duckdb_extension" could not be loaded because its signature is either missing or invalid and unsigned extensions are disabled by configuration (allow_unsigned_extensions)Failed to load 'HTTPFS', The file is not a DuckDB extension. The metadata at the end of the file is invalid
