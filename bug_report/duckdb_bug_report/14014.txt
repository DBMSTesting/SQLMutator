Title: Terminal UTF-8 display issues on Windows
Description:
### What happens?

UTF-8 characters are not displayed in the output, despite being parsed OK 

### To Reproduce

Windows default terminal when running duckdb.exe the codepage defaults on my machine to 437 OEM United States. I tried chcp 65001 but that's worse, the select never returns!

These examples are copied straight from the terminals and display perfectly, so it is not a font issue.

input
```
.mode csv
select 'Πρόσληψη αναφοράς ανά ημέρα' as grk;
```

output
```
grk
"π??σ???? α?αφ???? α?? ?µ??α"
```
Windows Git-Bash terminal works fine
```
select 'Πρόσληψη αναφοράς ανά ημέρα' as grk;
```
```
grk
"Πρόσληψη αναφοράς ανά ημέρα"
```
It's not an input parsing issue as I spent quite some time thinking I was writing the Parquet wrong but eventually distilled it down to the terminal.

```
SELECT grk FROM read_parquet('grk.parquet');
```
```
grk
"π??σ???? α?αφ???? α?? ?µ??α"
```

My answer would be "use Git Bash terminal then" but that means distributing that to everyone too rather than a link to duckdb.exe
