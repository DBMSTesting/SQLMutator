Title: [Python Dev] Make `cursor` creation threadsafe, perform compaction on the internal vector
Description:
This PR fixes #10223 

If the connection was passed to a thread with the intent of creating a cursor in the thread, this could cause a problem as the vector where the cursors are stored in was not protected against that.

If `cursor` is called many times in the programs execution, the vector in the parent connection that stores the cursors could grow unbounded, now cursors that have already been closed will get cleaned up when a new cursor is created.
