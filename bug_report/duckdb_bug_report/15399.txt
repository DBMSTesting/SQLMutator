Description:
### What happens?

```sql
$ duckdb-nightly
v1.1.4-dev2853 2d123094bb
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D create sequence s1;
D create table t (id bigint default nextval('s1'), v text);
D alter table t alter column id drop default;
D drop sequence s1;
Dependency Error:
Cannot drop entry "s1" because there are entries that depend on it.
table "t" depends on index "s1".
Use DROP...CASCADE to drop all dependents.
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
create sequence s1;
create table t (id bigint default nextval('s1'), v text);
alter table t alter column id drop default;
drop sequence s1;
