Title: Return blob results verbatim on read
Description:
Hi,

We discovered this when using DuckDB to transit a lot of raw blob data via the `duckdb-java` driver. Without this change, it is only possible for us to read blobs back intact via [`to_base64`](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/char.html#to_base64blob). Our process is memory intensive and we want to avoid the extra bloat from the base64 representation if at all possible.

Not sure if this is the best way to accomplish this, but the test illustrates the issue and our blobs come back intact with this change. `std::string` has no opinion on encoding so I think our expected behavior here is OK?

Please let me know if there's anything I can do to be helpful!!
