Title: Enable yacc stack growing
Description:
This PR enables yacc stack growing, preventing out-of-memory issues in the parser when dealing with larger stacks. The yacc version we use enables stack growing **only** if the location type is not set to a custom type. The postgres parser sets the location type to a custom type (`int` instead of a struct that has more detailed information), which disables the stack growing.
