Title: Fix #13666: avoid executing table in-out functions in parallel when executing on a single input
Description:
Fixes #13666
Fixes #13664 
Fixes #13639

As part of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12431 we added support for executing table in-out functions as regular table scans if their parameters are literals, to keep query plans more readable and keep plans backwards compatible. However, if parameters are literal - we cannot execute these in parallel as there is only a single row to operate on. We were incorrectly scheduling multiple threads to work on the same table in-out function, that would lead to duplicate results being emitted by each thread. This PR fixes the issue by disabling parallelism in this scenario.
