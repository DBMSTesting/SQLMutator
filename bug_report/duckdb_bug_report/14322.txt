Title: Issue 14275: Fix SQL value function binding when alias has same name
Description:
Change `GetSQLValueFunction` to take `ColumnRefExpression` - as `ParsedExpression` - so lookup in `alias_map` can be skipped if column is aliased to its own name.

This works but I'm sure there's a better duckdb way of doing it

Fixes issue #14275
