Title: read_csv hangs with parallel=true, works flawless with parallel=false
Description:
### What happens?

I have a CSV file that does never finishes parsing when running

```sql
SELECT SUM(Bruttoleistung) from read_csv("stromspeicher-134865.csv", ignore_errors=true);
```

but when disabling the `parallel` option, it's almost instant:

```sql
SELECT SUM(Bruttoleistung) from read_csv("stromspeicher-134865.csv", ignore_errors=true, parallel=false);
```



### To Reproduce

This is the CSV file that I used. Funnily enough this works when there is one line less in the CSV, and this also works when I just try with the first two and the last line of the CSV. The CSV is not without errors, but I am still expecting working parsing or an error.
