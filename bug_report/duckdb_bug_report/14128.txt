Title: Internal Error when a CTE query with DISTINCT(ON) is used twice with UNION
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB crashes with "INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 1 within vector of size 1" if the query with DISTINCT defined under WITH clause is used twice with UNION.

**Working query:**

```sql
WITH
    t1 AS (FROM (VALUES (1,2,3), (1,2,2)) t(a, b, c)),
    t2 AS (SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM t1)
SELECT a FROM t2;
```

**Failing queries:**

```sql
-- Simple DISTINCT
WITH
    t1 AS (FROM (VALUES (1,2,3), (1,2,2)) t(a, b, c)),
    t2 AS (SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM t1)
SELECT a FROM t2
UNION ALL 
SELECT b FROM t2;
```

```sql
-- DISTINCT ON
WITH
    t1 AS (FROM (VALUES (1,2,3), (1,2,2)) t(a, b, c)),
    t2 AS (SELECT DISTINCT ON (a) a, b, c FROM t1 ORDER BY c)
SELECT a FROM t2
UNION ALL 
SELECT b FROM t2;
```

The workaround is to use MATERIALIZED on the query with DISTINCT:
```sql
WITH
    t1 AS (FROM (VALUES (1,2,3), (1,2,2)) t(a, b, c)),
    t2 AS MATERIALIZED (SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM t1)
SELECT a FROM t2
UNION ALL 
SELECT b FROM t2;
```



### To Reproduce

```sql
-- Simple DISTINCT
WITH
    t1 AS (FROM (VALUES (1,2,3), (1,2,2)) t(a, b, c)),
    t2 AS (SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM t1)
SELECT a FROM t2
UNION ALL 
SELECT b FROM t2;
```

```sql
-- DISTINCT ON
WITH
    t1 AS (FROM (VALUES (1,2,3), (1,2,2)) t(a, b, c)),
    t2 AS (SELECT DISTINCT ON (a) a, b, c FROM t1 ORDER BY c)
SELECT a FROM t2
UNION ALL 
SELECT b FROM t2;
```
