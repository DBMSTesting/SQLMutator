Title: Support IN operator for LIST
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11158

These now work as expected:

```sql
SELECT 2 IN [1,2,3] -- true
```

```sql
create table tbl as select [1,2,3] a;

select 2 IN a from tbl; -- true
```

```sql
PREPARE v1 AS SELECT 1 IN ?

EXECUTE v1([1, 2, 3]) -- true
```
