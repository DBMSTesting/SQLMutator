Title: Feature #12699: Secondary Sort Framing
Description:
This PR extends the SQL `OVER` framing syntax to non-window functions with argument `ORDER BY` clauses. There is no change from the SQL standard (which does not allow argument `ORDER BY` clauses) but this extension make it legal and uses it to recognise framing.

* Add baseline data and query from paper.
* Convert RANK, PERCENT_RANK and CUME_DIST to use framing with secondary sorts.
* Convert ROW_NUMBER and NTILE to use framing with secondary sorts.
* Convert LEAD and LAG to use framing with secondary sorts.
