Title: Sample at least one value for the hyperloglog
Description:
fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2641

hyper log log wasn't sampling any values, so the distinct value count for the tables was 1, this made the cardinality estimator think every join was basically a cross product.
