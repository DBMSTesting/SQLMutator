Title: single process writes corrupt disk database accessed via ATTACH
Description:
### What happens?

Accessing the same on-disk DB directly and via ATTACH in the same process leads to corruption (and other strange behavior).

`duckdb.duckdb.SerializationException: Serialization Error: Failed to deserialize: field id mismatch, expected: 100, got: 0`

### To Reproduce

```python

import duckdb
import os
import tempfile


def attach_two() -> None:
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        print("Running in ", tmpdir)

        db1: str = str(os.path.join(tmpdir, "test_1.db"))
        db2: str = str(os.path.join(tmpdir, "test_2.db"))

        con1: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection = duckdb.connect(db1)
        print(con1.execute("SELECT * FROM pragma_version();").fetchall())
        con1.execute("CREATE TABLE t1 AS (SELECT 1 AS x)")

        con2: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection = duckdb.connect(db2)
        con2.execute(f"ATTACH '{db1}' AS db1_from_db2")

        con1.execute("INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (7);")
        con1.execute("CHECKPOINT;")
        con2.execute("INSERT INTO db1_from_db2.t1 VALUES (8)")
        con2.execute("CHECKPOINT;")

        con1.close()
        con2.close()

        con3: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection = duckdb.connect(db1)
        print(con3.execute("SELECT * FROM t1;").fetchall())

attach_two()
```
