Title: Fix race/deadlock in `FixedSizebuffer::Get()`
Description:
This PR fixes a potential deadlock/race in the `FixedSizeBuffer::Get()` method where the underlying buffer handle would get evicted between the check if it's still valid and the attempt to pin it. This is now prevented by adding an internal lock to the fixed size buffer itself. 

Additionally, we move the `FixedSizeBuffer`s in the `FixedSizeAllocator` into `unique_ptr`s instead of being stored raw in the map. This makes the lifetime management tighter and also allows us to remove the `Destroy` method as that is now handled by the destructor which gets invoked whenever buffers are removed or cleared in the allocator map.

We also move almost the entire `FixedSizeBuffer` interface to be private, and make the `FixedSizeAllocator` a friend class to prevent tampering with the buffer state from outside.
