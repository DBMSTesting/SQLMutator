Title: support INTERVAL with the AVG aggregate function
Description:
```sql
CREATE TABLE intervals AS
SELECT interval_value AS intvl
FROM (
    VALUES 
        ('1 hour'::interval),
        ('2 hours'::interval),
        ('3 hours'::interval),
        ('4 hours'::interval),
        ('5 hours'::interval)
) AS t(interval_value);
```

```sql
SELECT avg(intvl) FROM intervals;

┌────────────┐
│ avg(intvl) │
│  interval  │
├────────────┤
│ 03:00:00   │
└────────────┘
```

Using intervals with the AVG aggregate function is particularly valuable in calculating average age or duration metrics
e.g.

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM created_at) AS day_of_week,
    AVG(AGE(merged_at, created_at)) AS avg_merge_duration,
    COUNT(*) AS pr_count
FROM
    kafka
WHERE
    merged_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM created_at)
ORDER BY
    day_of_week;
```

I understand that @hawkfish has expertise in date and time-related pull requests. Any feedback would be helpful.
I will add a SUM aggregate in the following PR.
