Title: Add late_materialization_max_rows setting that allows you to configure the threshold at which late materialization is triggered
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15692

This PR adds the `late_materialization_max_rows` setting that allows you to configure the threshold at which late materialization is triggered. The default value is `50`.

Example usage:

```sql
SET late_materialization_max_rows=1000;
explain SELECT * FROM lineitem ORDER BY l_orderkey DESC LIMIT 1000;
```

The exact best setting is hard to determine - essentially the row-id pushdown has two components to it (1) the OR filter push-down, which is done for up to `dynamic_or_filter_threshold` rows (defaults to 50) and the min-max filter pushdown. 

The row-id rewrite generally always provides performance improvements for up to `dynamic_or_filter_threshold` which is why we select that as a default. Beyond that, it depends on the locality of the rows. If the min-max filter on row-ids is selective (i.e. the rows we select are close together physically in the table) the row-id rewrite is effective. If the rows are spread out, the rewrite can worsen performance.
