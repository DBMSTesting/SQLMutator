Title: Inconsistent results when using ORDER BY with PIVOT
Description:
### What happens?

PIVOT statement does not look to correctly handle ORDER BY clause.
Results sometimes sorted correctly and sometimes not. 
Running PIVOT multiple times produces different results

### To Reproduce

```sql
create table p (col1 timestamp, col2 int);
insert into p values ('2024-12-04 09:30:01', 100);
insert into p values ('2024-12-04 09:30:02', 100);
insert into p values ('2024-12-04 09:30:03', 100);
insert into p values ('2024-12-04 09:30:04', 100);

pivot p using sum (col2)
group by col1
order by col1;
```
