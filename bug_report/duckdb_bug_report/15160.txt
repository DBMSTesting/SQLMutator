Title: Read file in 100mb chunks in read_file/read_blob
Description:
This PR modified the behavior of `read_file` and `read_blob` to split the underlying filesystem read command into multiple reads of at most 100MB. This allows reading files larger than e.g. 2,147,479,552 bytes on linux, as requesting more than that in a single `read()` call is not supported. 

Fixes an issue found internally.
