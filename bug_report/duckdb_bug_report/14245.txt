Title: The JSONPointer '/'
Description:
### What happens?

On page 4 of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901 
there is an example of how the JSONPointer '/' should be evaluated.

The JSON example is:
```
{ "foo": ["bar", "baz"], : "": 0, ... }
```
And one of the JSONPointer examples is:

"/"          0

For this JSONPointer, however, DuckDB returns the entire document, e.g.

```sql
set variable json = json('{ "foo": ["bar", "baz"], "": 0}'::JSON);
select getvariable('json') -> '/' as value;
```
```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│           value            │
│            json            │
├────────────────────────────┤
│ {"foo":["bar","baz"],"":0} │
└────────────────────────────┘
```
Furthermore, it seems that DuckDB is effectively unable to use the
JSONPointer feature to access the value corresponding to a key equal
to the empty string, in any object in a JSON text.

In fact, I'm wondering whether there isn't a similar problem with
DuckDB's support for JSONPath.  According to jsonpath.com,
the path to the value specified by a top-level "" key is:  `$.''`

However according to DuckDB:

```sql
select getvariable('json') -> '$.''''' as value;
```
```
┌───────┐
│ value │
│ json  │
├───────┤
│       │
└───────┘
```


### To Reproduce

```sql
set variable json = json('{ "foo": ["bar", "baz"], "": 0}'::JSON);
select getvariable('json') -> '/' as value;
```
