Title: information_schema.tables.is_insertable_into is always true for all tables returned by duckdb_tables()
Description:
### What happens?

Hi there,

I’ve encountered some scenarios where certain tables provided by extensions don’t support inserts. This includes tables from the extension I’m working on, as well as those from Iceberg and Delta/Unity Catalog, which also don’t allow inserts.  @samansmink do you agree?

You can see this with:

```sql
select table_name, is_insertable_into from information_schema.tables 
```

I noticed that the current implementation assumes any table returned by `duckdb_tables()` can accept inserts, as seen in

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/19a32473166e0ad0d7472142a6f93872178c5fcf/src/catalog/default/default_views.cpp#L51


Would it be possible to enhance `duckdb_tables()` so that tables can indicate their capabilities for handling inserts? It would be great if this could also be reflected in the `information_schema.tables` table.

Thank you so much for considering this!

Best regards,
Rusty
