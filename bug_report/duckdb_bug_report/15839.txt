Title: Disable the RealNest benchmark nightly
Description:
Regression tests fail only on `nightly-build` runs so we could disable them for `nightly-build` for now as discussed [here](https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/4010#event-16026598475)

`github.event_name != 'repository_dispatch'` condition should not it let run on `nighly_build`
