Title: Linux httpfs extension at nightly is missing?
Description:
### What happens?

Attempting to install `httpfs` extension from nightly tries to access

https://nightly-extensions.duckdb.org/v1.1.3/linux_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz

which throws a 403 permission denied error.  Is that expected?   I don't have any trouble accessing the binaries for other archs (e.g. https://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.1.3/windows_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz resolves fine).  

### To Reproduce

to reproduce, attempt to open the URL https://nightly-extensions.duckdb.org/v1.1.3/linux_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz

Thanks!  (the regular release is working fine! for a while the regular one was broken and we had to switch the nightly, then it was fixed, but nightly became 403'd).
