Title: LOAD spatial; is not working for duckdb-swift
Description:
### What happens?

I am unable to load tha spatial queries in duckdb-swift. The `LOAD spatial` query is not working.

### To Reproduce

I have added the duckdb-swift package into my iOS project and i am trying to load the GPKG file using ST_Read spatial function. 
following is my code
 ```
 // Get the document directory path for the persistent database file
            let documentDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!
            let dbURL = documentDirectory.appendingPathComponent("gpkg_test.duckdb")
            
            // Initialize DuckDB with persistent storage
            let db = try DuckDB.Database(store: .file(at: dbURL))
            let connection = try db.connect()
            do {
                let res = try? connection.query("INSTALL spatial;")
                print(res)
                print("Spatial extension installation attempted.")
            }catch let error as DuckDB.DatabaseError {
                print("Database error during spatial extension installation: \(error), \(error.localizedDescription)")
            } catch {
                print("General error during spatial extension installation: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
            do {
                let res = try? connection.query("LOAD spatial;")
                print(res)
                print("Spatial extension loading attempted.")
            }catch let error as DuckDB.DatabaseError {
                print("Database error during spatial extension installation: \(error), \(error.localizedDescription)")
            } catch {
                print("General error during spatial extension installation: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
            
            if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: gpkgFilePath) {
                print("GeoPackage file found at path: \(gpkgFilePath)")
                
            } else {
                print("GeoPackage file not found at path: \(gpkgFilePath)")
                result(FlutterError(code: "FILE_NOT_FOUND", message: "GeoPackage file not found", details: nil))
                return
            }
            
          
        
            // Ensure the path is properly sanitized
//            let sanitizedPath = gpkgFilePath.replacingOccurrences(of: "\\", with: "")
            
            // Attempt to create a table by reading data from the GeoPackage file
            do {
                var res = try connection.query("CREATE TABLE federal_lands AS SELECT * FROM ST_Read('\(sanitizedPath)');")
                print("Table 'federal_lands' created successfully.\(res)")
            } catch {
                print("Error creating table: \(error)")
                result(FlutterError(code: "QUERY_ERROR", message: "Failed to create table: \(error.localizedDescription)", details: nil))
            }
            
```
I am getting response on Install but on `let res = try? connection.query("LOAD spatial;")` i am getting nil, Therefore i am unable to execute the ST_Read query. How can i do that?
