Title: [Metrics] Rework Optimizer Metrics  
Description:
As of this PR the optimizer metrics are configurable in `CUSTOM_PROFILING_SETTINGS`.

All optimizers now have their own metric setting that starts with `OPTIMIZER_` and is followed by its name. These are generated by the `generate_metric_enums.py` script which takes them from `optimizer_types.hpp`. This means that any optimizers added in the future will be automatically compatible with the profiling, once the script is run.  Any new metric types should also be added to the python script from now on.

This means that each optimizer metric can now be individually turned on and off. Alternatively you can also turn `ALL_OPTIMIZERS` which will add all optimizers to the settings or with `PRAGMA profiling_mode = 'detailed'`. If an optimizer is disabled, so will its corresponding metric. 

The metric `CUMULATIVE_OPTIMIZER_TIMING` has also been added that calculates total time taken by all the optimizers. 

This PR also adds the following settings which are also enabled by `profiling_mode = 'detailed'`:
-  `PLANNER`
   -  `PLANNER_BINDING`
-  `PHYSICAL_PLANNER`
   -  `PHYSICAL_PLANNER_COLUMN_BINDING`
   -   `PHYSICAL_PLANNER_RESOLVE_TYPES`
   -   `PHYSICAL_PLANNER_CREATE_PLAN`
