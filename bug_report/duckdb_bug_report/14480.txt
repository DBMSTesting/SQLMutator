Title: fix: standardize usage of LogicalType::ROW_TYPE for COLUMN_IDENTIFIER_ROW_ID
Description:
Updated two instances where LogicalType::BIGINT was mistakenly used instead of ROW_TYPE when handling the COLUMN_IDENTIFIER_ROW_ID pseudo-column. This change aligns the code with the rest of the project for consistency and clarity.
