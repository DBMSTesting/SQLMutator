Title: Test with recent threadsanitizer
Description:
Move threadsanitizer to use clang instead of gcc-10.

This seems to solve one the probem tracked down by @Tishj in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13115, where spurious detection around `condition_variable`'s wait logic are now not flagged anymore.

I think in case of sanitizers or similar tools, moving to more recent versions makes sense, since tools will improve (both what is detected and number of false positives).
