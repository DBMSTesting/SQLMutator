Title: product of unnested array versus not unnested array give very different answers
Description:
### What happens?

Two queries that I would expect to give the same answer give different results:

```sql
SELECT product(a) FROM UNNEST(RANGE(1, 11)) _ (a)
```

should produce the same answer as

```sql
SELECT product(a) FROM RANGE(1, 11) _ (a)
```

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

first_sql = "SELECT product(a) FROM UNNEST(RANGE(1, 11)) _ (a)"
second_sql = "SELECT product(a) FROM RANGE(1, 11) _ (a)"

first_answer = duckdb.execute(first_sql).fetchone()[0]
second_answer = duckdb.execute(second_sql).fetchone()[0]

assert first_answer == second_answer, f"{first_answer} != {second_answer}"
```

produces

```
‚ùØ python test.py
