Title: NULL check for invalid result
Description:
We run into a crash today where our code would check for column count in a result and result in a crash. While we can keep track of this ourselves and fix it, it may be helpful to have some  checks in the C API for DuckDB to check for the internal pointers being valid instead of a crash.
