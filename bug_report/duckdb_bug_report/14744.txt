Title: Add operator name to profiling output
Description:
DuckDB's [profiling output](https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/profiling.html#metrics) has an `OPERATOR_TYPE` field, which is an enum value. For custom operators in extensions, this just shows `INVALID`. Similarly, the json output of EXPLAIN also renders these custom operators as `INVALID` while the query_tree output of the same API is using the operator's name instead (e.g. `PhysicalOperator::GetName()`), making it possible for custom operators to render with their own string value. The PR here brings parity into the json explain API and profiling API, adding the operator's name as metric and exposing it consistently across the two APIs.
