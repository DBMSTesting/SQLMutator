Title: [FriendlySQL] Expand functionality of the Unpacked COLUMNS expression
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15676

Previously, the syntax for unpacked columns (<https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11872>) looked like this:
`*COLUMNS(<star expression>)`, which would produce `N` new column reference expression inside the parent expression:
```sql
select [*COLUMNS(*)] from (select 21 a, 42 b)
```
Is equivalent to:
```sql
select [a, b] from (select 21 a, select 42 b)
```

### `UNPACK(COLUMNS(*))`

With the old syntax it's not possible to use these produces column reference expressions inside other expression, for example to cast every column to VARCHAR.

The old syntax can still be used, but to use the produced columns in an expression, this can now be used:
`UNPACK(<some expression that contains a COLUMNS(...)>)`

For example:
```sql
select [UNPACK(COLUMNS(*)::VARCHAR)] from (select 21 a, 1.234 b)
```
Is equivalent to:
```sql
select [a::VARCHAR, b::VARCHAR] from (select 21 a, select 1.234 b)
```
