Title: `sniff_csv` quote character detection regression in 1.2.0
Description:
### What happens?

On 1.1.3, `sniff_csv` detects `"` as the quote character in the following .csv file. On 1.2.0, `sniff_csv` detects `'` as the quote character, which seems to be a regression.

.csv contents:

```csv
datecol,textcol
1/1/19,"text"
1/2/19,"text"
1/3/19,"text"
1/4/19,"text"
1/5/19,"text"
1/6/19,"text, with comma"
1/9/19,'text'
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
FROM sniff_csv('myfile.csv', null_padding=true);
```
