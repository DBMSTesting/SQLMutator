Title: Update httplib from v0.10.2 to v0.14.3
Description:
Just some maintenance, we hope that it will resolve some hard-to-explain issues for our users.

The latest version is 16.0, which I would have liked to update to, but httplib deprecates OpenSSL 1.1.1 since v0.15.0, and we still want to support OpenSSL 1.1.1. Therefore, I've updated to the latest version that still supports it, which is v0.14.3.
