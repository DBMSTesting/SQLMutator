Title: Parquet writer: Re-implement GetRowSize for Strings
Description:
This got lost during the column writer unification. This fixes a regression in the Parquet writer where, when writing large strings, the page size would be greatly underestimated. This is used upstream in the writer to limit page size to 100MB. Since the page size would be underestimated, we would be writing much larger pages than this when writing large strings, leading to potential memory issues. In addition, since Parquet pages are limited to 2GB (on account of page size being stored as an `int32`) - I think this could also lead to too large pages being written that could not be correctly represented in the Parquet spec in certain edge cases.
