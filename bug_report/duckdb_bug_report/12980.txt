Title: Use jaro winkler similarity for finding similar entries in catalog
Description:

When a catalog entry is not found, we try to helpfully offer a recommended alternative, e.g.:

```sql
D select arg_mi(42,84);
-- Catalog Error: Scalar Function with name arg_mi does not exist!
-- Did you mean "arg_min"?
-- LINE 1: select arg_mi(42,84);
--                ^
```

This currently uses the [levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) on candidate catalog entries. While this works reasonably well, the levenshtein distance has a shortcoming in that it does not really work well on entries that have different lengths - as the edit distance metric used penalizes extra characters in the same manner as *different* characters. As a result, strings of similar length are almost always shown over what we would consider "more similar" strings.

For example, in the current release:

```sql
D select jaro_winkler('a', 'b');
-- Catalog Error: Scalar Function with name jaro_winkler does not exist!
-- Did you mean "arg_min"?
-- LINE 1: select jaro_winkler('a', 'b');
--                ^
```

Most likely the user meant either the functions `jaro_winkler_similarity`, or `jaro_similarity`. However, the levenshtein metric considers the more similarity sized `arg_min` as more similar:

```sql
D select levenshtein('jaro_winkler', 'arg_min') as levenshtein;
┌─────────────┐
│ levenshtein │
│    int64    │
├─────────────┤
│           7 │
└─────────────┘
D select levenshtein('jaro_winkler', 'jaro_similarity') as levenshtein;
┌─────────────┐
│ levenshtein │
│    int64    │
├─────────────┤
│           7 │
└─────────────┘
D select levenshtein('jaro_winkler', 'jaro_winkler_similarity') as levenshtein;
┌─────────────┐
│ levenshtein │
│    int64    │
├─────────────┤
│          11 │
└─────────────┘
```

The [jaro-winkler similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro–Winkler_distance) is instead designed towards preferring matching prefixes, which makes the matches much more natural. Here's some examples of previous and new suggestions:


| Query  | Old Suggestion | New Suggestion  |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| lea    | era            | least           |
| jaro   | bar            | jaro_similarity |
| hist   | list           | histogram       |
| to_min | min            | to_minutes      |
