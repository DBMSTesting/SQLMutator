Title: Unify behavior of `range`/`generate_series` with PostgreSQL
Description:
With this PR, _e.g._, `SELECT * FROM range(3, 1)` no longer throws an error, but returns an empty result instead. This choice is opinionated, but it is more in line with the behavior of PostgreSQL. Fixes part of issue https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15483.
