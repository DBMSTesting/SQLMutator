Title: quantile_disc behaviour not matching the docs
Description:
### What happens?

For a simple dataset of 6 numbers (1000, 2000, ..., 6000) of type int32, duckdb v1.1.1 reports the 0.7 quantile to be 5000, whereas the docs say it should be `the floor(pos * (n_nonnull_values - 1))th (zero-indexed) element`, in this case it's `floor(0.7 * (6 - 1))`, which is 3, so it should return 3rd 0-indexed element, which is 4000. The same goes for 0.9 quantile (reported 6000 instead of 5000), so my guess is that it incorrectly rounds the position (using `round` instead of `floor`).

### To Reproduce

```
create table kek(sales integer);
insert into kek (sales) values (1000), (2000), (3000), (4000), (5000), (6000);
select quantile_disc(sales, 0.7) from kek;
select quantile_disc(sales, 0.9) from kek;
```
