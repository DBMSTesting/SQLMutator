Title: CASE statements in TABLE MACRO
Description:
### What happens?

`CASE` conditional statements are only working as documented in scalar macros, while table macros throw a parser error.

Is this intentionally unsupported? Documentation doesn't state incompatibility and this feature can be crucial for table macros.


### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO url(url, format) AS TABLE (CASE WHEN format == 'JSON' THEN (SELECT * FROM read_json_auto(url)) ELSE (SELECT * FROM read_csv(url)) END);
```

```
Parser Error: syntax error at or near "CASE"
```
