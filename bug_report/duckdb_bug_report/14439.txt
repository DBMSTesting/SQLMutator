Title: CSV Parallel Reading Validation
Description:
This PR reintroduces CSV Validation and extends the new line finder algorithm to solve the cases where we wouldn't be able to properly read a CSV file in parallel.

The validation works by checking that each thread that started reading the CSV file from a random buffer piece, started from the correct place, ensuring we don't have either data replication or data loss.
