Title: Properly set `external` flag again in `RadixPartitionedHashTable`
Description:
I found out that we weren't unpinning any blocks in the hash aggregation, causing us to run out of memory. This is due to the `external` flag not being set. I think this happened because I changed the partitioning code a bit when optimizing the hash aggregation before the holidays.

I've also removed some unnecessary flushes. These should already be handled properly in `standard_buffer_manager.cpp`.
