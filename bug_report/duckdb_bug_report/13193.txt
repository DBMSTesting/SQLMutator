Title: Exception Raised when trying to EXPLAIN ANALYZE with parameters
Description:
### What happens?

When I `execute` the query `EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = ?` with parameters I get `Error: Invalid Input Error: Parameter argument/count mismatch, identifiers of the excess parameters: 1`.

If I have to remove the parameters to make a sample query string it will take a long time. Thus please make parameters work.

I can see this is the same issue as in Javascript reported in the closed issue https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/9393.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

# Create a connection
con = duckdb.connect()

# Create a cursor
cur = con.cursor()

# Create a table
cur.execute("CREATE TABLE my_table (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR)")

# Insert some data
cur.execute("INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Jane'), (3, 'Doe')")

# Execute a parameterized query
query = "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = ?"
params = ("John",)
cur.execute(query, params)

# Fetch the results
results = cur.fetchall()
print(results)

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
con.close()
```

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/jovyan/repos/mt-pm-reporting/script.py", line 18, in <module>
    cur.execute(query, params)
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: Attempting to execute an unsuccessful or closed pending query result
Error: Invalid Input Error: Parameter argument/count mismatch, identifiers of the excess parameters: 1
