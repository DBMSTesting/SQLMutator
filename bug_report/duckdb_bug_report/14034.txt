Title: [Dev] Fix an issue causing ExecuteTask to do much more work than intended
Description:
This PR makes `ExecutePushInternal` respect the `max_chunks` set in the call to `PipelineExecutor::Execute(idx_t max_chunks)`

When running DuckDB inside an environment where the control over received signals (like SIGINT) is not instant (like Python or Postgres), we rely on ExecuteTask to return after doing a small amount of processing work.

In the DuckDB CLI this problem was not apparent because SIGINT is handled and `Interrupt()` is called instantly, which is respected by the execution.
This problem only appeared because the `interrupt` flag could not be set as the application was first waiting for ExecuteTask to return.
