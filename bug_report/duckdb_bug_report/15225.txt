Title: [Python][Dev] Fix `test_filter_pushdown.py`
Description:
This PR addresses <https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3578> partly
Namely the `Linux 3.8 -> panic in Rust` portion

The order of `precision` and `scale` was switched at some point (I believe polars 0.19.12 -> 0.19.13), which made this code break on earlier polars versions
