Title: Out-of-memory error when creating index
Description:
### What happens?

I'm trying to create an index on a dataset of ~1 billion rows. It gets 33% done and then I get an out-of-memory error:

```sh
D create index some_column_idx on some_table (some_column);
 33% ▕███████████████████▊                                        ▏ Run Time (s): real 501.013 user 290.570255 sys 433.967392
Out of Memory Error:
could not allocate block of size 256.0 KiB (12.8 GiB/12.7 GiB used)
```

`memory_limit` is auto-set to 12.7 GB. `temp_directory` is also auto-set and I can see that Duck is spilling over into that directory. I'm still getting the error even though I have ~250GB of available disk space.

```sh
D select current_setting('temp_directory');
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   current_setting('temp_directory')                    │
│                                varchar                                 │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
