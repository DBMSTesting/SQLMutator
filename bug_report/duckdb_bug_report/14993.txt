Title: [Arrow] Fix scan of an object providing the PyCapsuleInterface when projection pushdown is possible.
Description:
This PR fixes #14980

We have no explicit support for scanning a single RecordBatch. Because the RecordBatch provides `__arrow_c_stream__` it gets scanned by using this.

To remove the reliance on pyarrow we disable the pushdowns for this scan, which caused a problem when projection pushdown *would* have been used by the regular `arrow_scan` table function.
