Title: Minor window improvements
Description:
This PR cleans up some minor unnecessary performance degradations in the window operator found by the profiler.

* Turn `window_start` and `window_end` into `idx_t` - this removes a bunch of `NumericCast` code
* Pre-allocate enough space in `payload_collection` (`payload_count`) - this prevents having to resize continuously during the append

With these changes the following query gets sped up from `0.4s` to `0.27s` on my macbook (~30% faster).

```sql
SELECT SETSEED(0.8675309);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE df AS
      SELECT 
          RANDOM() AS a,
          RANDOM() AS b,
          RANDOM() AS c,
      FROM range(10_000_000);
SELECT
    LAG(a, -1) OVER () AS a_1,
    LAG(a, -2) OVER () AS a_2,
    LAG(b, -1) OVER () AS b_1,
    LAG(b, -2) OVER () AS b_2
  FROM df;
