Title: Feature #1272: Window Group Preparation  
Description:
Move the construction of the row data collections and masks
to the Finalize phase. These are relatively fast
and will use data that is still hot (e.g., the sort keys).
This will make it easier parallelise the remaining two passes
over the data (build and execute).
