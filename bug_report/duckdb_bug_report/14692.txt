Title: `list_concat([1], null)` doesn't match `[1] || null`
Description:
### What happens?

The behavior of `list_concat([1], null)` doesn't match that of `[1] || null`.

Additionally, the double pipe version type is `int32` which seems incorrect.

### To Reproduce

```pycon
>>> import duckdb
>>> duckdb.__version__
'1.1.3'
>>> duckdb.sql("select [1] || null as pipe, list_concat([1], null) as func")
┌───────┬─────────┐
│ pipe  │  func   │
│ int32 │ int32[] │
├───────┼─────────┤
│  NULL │ [1]     │
└───────┴─────────┘
```
