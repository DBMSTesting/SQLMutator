Title: Add dedicated `filter` method to compression algorithms
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15186

This PR adds an optional `filter` callback to compression functions, which can be used to execute table filters directly on the compressed data:

```cpp
typedef void (*compression_filter_t)(ColumnSegment &segment, ColumnScanState &state, idx_t vector_count, Vector &result, SelectionVector &sel, idx_t &sel_count, const TableFilter &filter);
```

This PR implements the method for the `RLE` and `constant validity` compression functions.
