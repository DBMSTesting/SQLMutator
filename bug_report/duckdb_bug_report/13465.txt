Title: [Dev] Mention non-unique indexes in UPSERT `DO UPDATE SET` error
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2743

Because of the currently expected limitation that INDEXes don't support UPDATE statements, targeting a column that is referenced by an INDEX (even if that INDEX is not UNIQUE) is not supported and will throw an exception.
