Title: Late Materialization Optimizer
Description:
This PR adds the Late Materialization optimizer that enables late materialization for certain queries - in particular top-n (`ORDER BY .. LIMIT ..`), limit + offset, and sample queries. The optimization piggy-backs off of the row-id filter pushdown introduced in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15020 - and does the row-id rewrites mentioned there automatically.

#### Rewrites

Here are some examples of rewrites:

###### Top-N
```sql
SELECT * FROM lineitem ORDER BY l_extendedprice DESC LIMIT 5;

-- becomes

SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE rowid IN (
    SELECT rowid FROM lineitem ORDER BY l_extendedprice DESC LIMIT 5)
ORDER BY l_extendedprice DESC;

```

###### Limit + Offset
```sql
SELECT * FROM lineitem LIMIT 1000000 OFFSET 10000000;

-- becomes


SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE rowid IN (
    SELECT rowid FROM lineitem LIMIT 1000000 OFFSET 10000000)
ORDER BY rowid;

```


#### Performance

```sql
SELECT * FROM lineitem ORDER BY l_extendedprice DESC LIMIT 5;
```
