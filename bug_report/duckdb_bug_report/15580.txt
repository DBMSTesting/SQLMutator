Title: [Julia]: Auto-generate api.jl with new order
Description:
This is a follow up PR to #15474 that changes the order in which the functions in `api.jl` are defined. They now have the same order as in `duckdb.h` and with proper grouping.

To switch back to the original order the `--use-original-order` flag in the `update_api.sh` script can be set.

In the previous PR the original order was intentionally kept to more easily spot discrepancies between the hand-coded and automatically generated wrapper and to keep the git diff to a minimum for review.
