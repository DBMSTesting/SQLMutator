Title: adaptive filters should not reorder filters that can throw
Description:
fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3180

And this is a followup to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13617 

If the table being filtered is large enough, the order of the expressions will get moved around due to adaptive filtering. To prevent this, expression reordering now places severe penalties on expressions that can throw, effectively forcing them to be executed last. Then during adaptive filters, we set the likelihood of swapping filters that can throw to 0. This allows other filters to be swapped, but not filters. that can throw.
