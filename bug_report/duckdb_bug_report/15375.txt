Title: support cast STRUCTs of different sizes when union_by_name is set to true
Description:
### What happens?

Since union_by_name support parquet files with different number of fields supporting different length struct should also be supported

### To Reproduce

```sql
copy ( select {'i' : 2 } as s ) TO '1.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet', COMPRESSION 'zstd', ROW_GROUP_SIZE 100_000);

copy ( select {'i' : 3, 'j' : 99 } as s ) TO '2.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet', COMPRESSION 'zstd', ROW_GROUP_SIZE 100_000);

select * from read_parquet(['1.parquet', '2.parquet'], union_by_name = True);
```
```console
Mismatch Type Error: Type STRUCT(i INTEGER, j INTEGER) does not match with STRUCT(i INTEGER). Cannot cast STRUCTs of different size
```
