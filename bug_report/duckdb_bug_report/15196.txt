Title: Add DictionaryId that can be used to uniquely identify dictionaries, and use this in the aggregate HT to cache look-ups
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15152

This PR enables the caching of results computed for dictionaries across vectors by (optionally) assigning them with a unique identifier. The identifier is a string that needs to be unique so we can distinguish between a vector having the same dictionary or a different dictionary as the previous vector. It does not have to be globally unique (i.e. really only in the same pipeline for the same thread). 

* For our own storage, the dictionary id is set to the `ColumnSegment` pointer address. Since we never de-allocate `ColumnSegments` while scanning this works
* For Parquet dictionaries, the dictionary id is set to `[parquet_filename]_[column_name]_[byte_offset]`
