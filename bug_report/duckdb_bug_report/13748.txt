Title: Fix #13269: remove redundant create_sort_key when do distinct
Description:
This pr try to fix #13269, remove unnecessary `create_sort_key` when do distinct.

since `LogicalDistinct` generate PhysicalOperator directly, it seems lose the chance do `Optimizer::Optimize`, so convert `LogicalDistinct` to another  LogicalOperator such as `LogicalAggregate`  may could be a better solution.
