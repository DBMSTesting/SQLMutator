Title: Joins seem broken
Description:
### What happens?

This join should return no more than 30, but returns 522.

Some columns work as expected, strings etc. but some data types not. Ex. the "Date" column.

```sql
create table t1 as select * from read_csv('covid-small.csv');
create table t2 as select * from read_csv('covid-small.csv');
select count(*) total from t1 inner join t2 on t1."Date"=t2."Date" ;
```
