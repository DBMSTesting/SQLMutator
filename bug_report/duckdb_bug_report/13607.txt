Title: Block verification run and FixedSizeBuffer fix
Description:
Attempts to solve https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13311.

The original file does not contain SQL commands, etc., to generate the data, so I cannot confirm that this PR fixes the original issue. However, we did notice irregularities in the block counters in some cases, potentially related to the issue, so this PR adds a verification pass to the block usage counters. And a fix for the irregular counters.
