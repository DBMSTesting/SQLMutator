Title: Fix #13933: disable join filter pushdown when a join is performed over collated columns
Description:
Fixes #13933

The issue is that when binding `min/max` with a collation, the aggregate would be transformed into `arg_min/arg_max` instead. This expects two input columns rather than a single input column - which then caused problems as the join filter pushdown only passed in a single column. This PR disables join filter pushdown in this scenario (when joining on collated columns).
