Title: Faster re-builds
Description:
This PR slightly changes the way we generate `generated_extension_headers.hpp` so that the file modification time only changes if its contents actually change. We somewhat abuse CMake's `configure_file` for this, specifically ["The generated file is modified and its timestamp updated on subsequent cmake runs only if its content is changed."](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/configure_file.html)

With this PR, a debug re-build on unchanged sources (`time make debug`): 1.1s. On `main`:  10s. It's not much but it's honest work.
