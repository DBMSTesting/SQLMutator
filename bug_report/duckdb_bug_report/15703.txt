Title: Remove shuffle from sampling
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3792

Turns out the shuffle implementation is not guaranteed to be the same [between library implementations](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle). Also mentioned by Carlo in the original issue.

This PR removes the shuffle call and just always uses our own implementation. 

Happy to generalize the shuffle implementation and put it somewhere in `common/` if desired. Also can remove modifications to the `RandomEngine` class that make it a [Uniform Random Bit Generator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/UniformRandomBitGenerator)
