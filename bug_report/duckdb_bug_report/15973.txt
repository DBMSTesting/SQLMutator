Title: fix: allow table returning in/out functions to accept LogicalType::TABLE in any argument position.
Description:
This relaxes the restriction for table in/out functions to require the LogicalType::TABLE argument as the first argument.

This allows functions of this form.

```sql
select * from example_function('example', (select * from table));
```

This is useful to extension creators like myself.
