Title: INTERNAL Error: Incorrect stats size for type TIMETZ
Description:
### What happens?

Loading parquet file into DuckDB table with read_parquet leads to internal error. But, the R arrow package can successfully load the parquet file with no issues leading me to think that the parquet is fine and the duckdb parquet reader may have an issue.

### To Reproduce

Reading these time columns leads to an internal error.
```
library(duckdb)
con <- dbConnect(duckdb())
dbSendQuery(con, "CREATE TABLE mytable AS FROM read_parquet('times.parquet');")
```
Gives error:
```
Error: rapi_prepare: Failed to prepare query CREATE TABLE mytable AS FROM read_parquet('pk/1.pk');
Error: INTERNAL Error: Incorrect stats size for type TIMETZ
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```
But using arrow package I get : 
```
arrow::read_parquet('times.parquet')
# A tibble: 1 Ã— 2
  col1   col2  
  <time> <time>
1 00'00" 00'00"
```
I've reduced the original file down to the minimum required to reproduce the internal error, 1 line, 2 columns. I didn't check if only one column is the issue or if its both.
