Title: [Fix] Incorrect allocation size in temporary file management
Description:
The nightly block size run found an underflow in temporary memory management. With blocks and, consequently, files that are not `DEFAULT_BLOCK_ALLOC_SIZE,` we incorrectly set the disk size to `buffer.size`. As we later obtain the file's entire size, we need to use `buffer.AllocSize()` instead.
