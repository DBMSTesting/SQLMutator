Title: read_csv() can't skip rows where cells have a new line char
Description:
### What happens?

Using `read_csv()` with the `skip` option fails if there are new line characters (`\n`) in any of the row cells.

Having the new line char on the header row is ok, it just fails if the char is in a row before the header.

### To Reproduce

```python
import csv
import duckdb

data = [
    ("x", "y", "test\n123"),
    ("a", "b", "c"),
    ('1', '2', '3')
]

with open('test.csv', 'w') as f:
    w = csv.writer(f)
    for row in data:
        w.writerow(row)

with duckdb.connect() as con:
    con.execute("select * from read_csv('test.csv', skip=1)")
```
