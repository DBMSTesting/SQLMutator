Title: Linux32 also to regular ci
Description:
More viable version of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13031, where Linux 32 checks are added as part of regular CI, so to find earlier problems with compilation in gcc 4.8 / 32 bit only.

Note that tests are only performed in nightly runs, given there are currently a bunch of failures.
