Title: In Python, `create()` function from `read_csv()` source doesn't work
Description:
### What happens?

Trying to read a 1Gb csv file and create a corresponding table. Works fine if I save as parquet file as intermediate step, doesn't work if I try to call `table.create()` after `table = con.read_csv()`. Full example here: https://github.com/PatentsView/PatentsView-Code-Examples/blob/duckdb-csv-bug/data-downloads/1-joining-tables.ipynb

### To Reproduce

Full source: https://github.com/PatentsView/PatentsView-Code-Examples/blob/duckdb-csv-bug/data-downloads/1-joining-tables.ipynb

Doesn't work - keeps running for more than 10 minutes:

```python
import duckdb

ddb = duckdb.connect('./patentsview.ddb')
csv_read_in = ddb.read_csv('g_patent.tsv', header=True, quotechar='"', delimiter="\t", all_varchar=True)

csv_read_in.create('g_patent_from_csv')  # Issue is with the create statement
```

Works fine, runs in 4 seconds:

```python
import duckdb

ddb = duckdb.connect('./patentsview.ddb')

csv_read_in = ddb.read_csv('g_patent.tsv', header=True, quotechar='"', delimiter="\t", all_varchar=True)
csv_read_in.write_parquet("g_patent.parquet")

parquet_read_in = ddb.read_parquet("g_patent.parquet")
parquet_read_in.create('g_patent')
ddb.table('g_patent')
```
