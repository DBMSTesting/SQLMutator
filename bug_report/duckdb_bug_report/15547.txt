Title: Store catalog and schema names in Function objects for serialization
Description:
Functions created in arbitrary catalogs and schemas require their catalog and schema names to be serialized. Without this, FunctionSerializer fails to locate functions as it only searches SYSTEM_CATALOG and DEFAULT_SCHEMA.

This change adds catalog and schema name storage to Function objects. The corresponding names are set during the construction of ScalarFunctionCatalogEntry, TableFunctionCatalogEntry, and AggregateFunctionCatalogEntry instances, ensuring successful serialization and reference resolution.
