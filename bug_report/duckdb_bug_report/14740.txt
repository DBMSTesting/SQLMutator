Title: An alias of returning clause is dicarded in ToString of UpdateStatement and DeleteStatement
Description:
### What happens?

This issue is related to #14523

In both following SQLs:

```
UPDATE Foo SET id = 1 RETURNING id AS updated;
DELETE FROM Foo WHERE id = 1 RETURNING id AS deleted;
```

1. `SQLStatement` is extracted from Connection.
2. Call `SQLStatement::ToString` method.

A SQL discarded alias of returning clause is returned.

But  a RETURNING clause of UPDATE and DELETE statement is not documented  in the current official document.

https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/update#syntax
https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/delete#syntax

So I don't judge it as BUG.
I also want to know whether it is documented the RETURNING clause of UPDATE and DELETE statement in the future version.

### To Reproduce

### UPDATE statement

Code:
```cpp
std::string sql("UPDATE Foo SET id = 1 RETURNING id AS updated");
auto stmts = conn.ExtractStatements(sql);

std::out << stmts[0]->ToString() << std::end;
```

Actual result:
```
UPDATE Foo SET id = 1 RETURNING id
```

Expected result:
```
UPDATE Foo SET id = 1 RETURNING id AS updated
```

### DELETE statement

Code:
```cpp
std::string sql("DELETE FROM Foo WHERE id = 1 RETURNING id AS deleted");
auto stmts = conn.ExtractStatements(sql);

std::out << stmts[0]->ToString() << std::end;
```

Actual result:
```
DELETE FROM Foo WHERE id = 1 RETURNING id
```

Expected result:
```
DELETE FROM Foo WHERE id = 1 RETURNING id AS deleted
```
