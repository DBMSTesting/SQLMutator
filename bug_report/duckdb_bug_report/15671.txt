Title: Compilation warning for sign-compare
Description:
### What happens?

When I compile duckdb with debug mode, I get compilation warning.
```
/workspaces/pg_mooncake/third_party/duckdb/src/common/types/varint.cpp:37:44: warning: promoted bitwise complement of an unsigned value is always nonzero [-Wsign-compare]
   37 |                         if (~varint_ptr[3] == 0) {
      |                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~
```


### To Reproduce

Compile duckdb with debug mode.

I also write a minimal reproducible code snippet to demonstrate the issue.
```
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>

int main() {
    uint8_t x = std::numeric_limits<uint8_t>::max();
    std::cerr << "max value for uint8_t is " << static_cast<uint64_t>(x) << std::endl; // 255
    uint8_t y = ~x;
    std::cerr << "not value for max uint8_t is " << static_cast<uint64_t>(y) << std::endl;  // 0

    // Current implementation.
    if (~x == 0) {
        std::cerr << "should throw exception in duckdb" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "compiler is right!" << std::endl;  // go this path due to promition
    }

    // Corrected version.
    if (static_cast<uint8_t>(~x) == 0) {
        std::cerr << "should throw exception in duckdb" << std::endl;  // go this path
    } else {
        std::cerr << "compiler is right!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Compilation command:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -Wsign-compare test_signed_comparison.cc -o test
```
It's stably generating the same warning message.
