Title: Copy From Database - create a balanced UNION ALL tree instead of a depth-first union all tree to avoid stack overflows
Description:
`COPY FROM DATABASE` creates a number of `INSERT` statements, unified through `UNION ALL` operators to execute this as a single plan. This PR reworks how these union all statements are created to create a balanced tree instead of a depth-first tree, leading to a much less deep tree. This avoids stack overflows later on when copying databases with many tables.
