Title: Fix for row-id pushdown, and remove unnecessarily complicated method
Description:
Row IDs don't have segments, so we can't do segment-level skipping.

This problem only shows up with dynamic filters, since the filter changes while we're in the middle of a scan. With a static filter we would never get to this point (since the row group would be filtered out entirely at an earlier stage).
