Title: Cannot make Concurrency work - One read and write process with multiple read only process
Description:
### What happens?

I am new to DuckDB. I tried having One read and write process with multiple read only process in JAVA and get the error "File is already open in". So I tried the same with CLI and get similar error. As per the documentation here https://duckdb.org/docs/connect/concurrency.html#handling-concurrency this should work. Is my understanding not correct?
