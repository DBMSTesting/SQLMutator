Title: Optimizer does not combine LogicalGets in UNION when both Scans have identical criteria
Description:
### What happens?

We have a duckdb-extension for our custom storage layer, and our query patterns have multiple analytics being (separately) requested for the same "base criteria" (i.e. "table_name", "pushdown-filters", "pushdown-projections")

We are able to UNION the analytics into a single query; but the optimized plan still shows multiple LogicalGet nodes and our storage layer still receives multiple, identical read calls.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE INTEGERS(i INT, j INT, k INT);
INSERT INTO INTEGERS VALUES (1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO INTEGERS VALUES (2, 2, 2);
INSERT INTO INTEGERS VALUES (3, 3, 3);
INSERT INTO INTEGERS VALUES (4, 4, 4);
INSERT INTO INTEGERS VALUES (5, 5, 5);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view1 AS SELECT i, k FROM integers WHERE k IN (1, 2);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view2 AS SELECT j, k FROM integers WHERE k IN (1, 2);
EXPLAIN ANALYZE FROM view1 UNION ALL BY NAME FROM view2;
```
