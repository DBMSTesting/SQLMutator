Title: Binder Error: inconsistency re regexp_extract within table-valued vs scalar function
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following program:
```
create or replace function s(str, re, replacement) as table (
   (with cte as (select regexp_extract(str, re, ['head', 'tail']) as r)
    select r['head'] || replacement || r['tail'] from cte limit 1)
);

from s('abracadabra', '^([^r]*r[^r]*)r(.*)', 'F');
```
This works as expected.

By inspection, s() returns a single value (or perhaps NULL), and from
a certain perspective, it thus ought to be possible to make it a
scalar function. (In some scenarios, it's more than convenience that's at stake.)

However, doing so (see below) produces an error:

Binder Error: regexp_extract with LIST requires a constant pattern

But when s() was defined as a table function, there was no such
constraint!  This inconsistency strikes me as a bug (which of course
I'd prefer to see resolved by removing the constraint), but if it
isn't, then at least one could say the error message (and presumably
the documentation) is incomplete (i.e. the error message could
mention the relevance of the context).

Thank you.


### To Reproduce

```
create or replace function s(str, re, replacement) as (
   (with cte as (select regexp_extract(str, re, ['head', 'tail']) as r)
    select r['head'] || replacement || r['tail'] from cte limit 1)
);

select s('abracadabra', '^([^r]*r[^r]*)r(.*)', 'F');
```
