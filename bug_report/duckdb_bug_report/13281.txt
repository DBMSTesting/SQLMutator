Title: [Upsert] Fix crash caused by scanning an empty LocalTableStorage
Description:
This PR fixes #13274

As part of a transaction, the INSERT gets or creates a LocalTableStorage object, which gets merged into the physical DataTable on commit.

With the `DO NOTHING` conflict clause, an UPSERT could create a LocalTableStorage and end up appending 0 tuples to it, which fails the assumption that a LocalTableStorage is not empty when scanning it.

~~To combat this, we now clean up the created LocalTableStorage if it was created and left empty when finalizing the append.~~
We now simply skip the empty local table storage.
