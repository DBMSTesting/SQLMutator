Title: [PySpark] Add more functions such as ascii, asin, btrim, char, corr, ... and fix differences in ordering of null values between PySpark and DuckDB
Description:
For fixing the ordering of null values, I had to set `default_null_order` to `nulls_first` for the whole DuckDB connection. I've added the reasoning as comments in the code but let me know if I should expand on that. Thanks to the PySpark tests in CI, we at least now, that for the current test suite, this solves it.
