Title: [Dev] Fix issue related to unpacked columns and the NOT operator
Description:
This PR fixes #15290 

NOT only expected a single expression, because in the grammar it only takes a single expression
Because of `*COLUMNS(...)` this can expand to multiple expressions

The internal exception has been turned into a binder exception, disallowing the use of *COLUMNS here (if it resolves to more than a single expression)
