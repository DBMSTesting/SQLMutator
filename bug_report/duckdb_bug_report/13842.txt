Title: Unexpected result after creating index on `DATE` column
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test case. The third query is unexpected as it falsely omitted one row. The second query shows that the expression `'1970-01-03' >= t0.c0` is true for all the rows and thus the third query should return all three rows of the original table.

I built duckdb by `GEN=ninja make`. Not sure if the issue is related to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13785. 

### To Reproduce

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0;

CREATE TABLE  t0(c0 DATE);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES  ('1970-01-02');
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('1970-01-02');
CREATE INDEX t0i0 ON t0(c0 DESC);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('1970-01-03');

SELECT * FROM t0; -- 1970-01-02, 1970-01-02, 1970-01-03
SELECT ('1970-01-03' >= t0.c0) FROM t0; -- true, true, true (3 rows)
SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE ('1970-01-03' >= t0.c0);
-- Expected: 1970-01-02, 1970-01-02, 1970-01-03 (3 rows)
-- Actual: 1970-01-02, 1970-01-02 (2 rows)
