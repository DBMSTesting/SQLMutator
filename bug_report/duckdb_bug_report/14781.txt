Title: Add automatic sampling for integral types
Description:
This PR adds sampling only for integral types. Currently each thread collects a sample during `RowGroupCollection::Append()` and on `::Finalize` the samples are merged. 


If a table contains non-integral type columns, the sample just includes `NULL` for those columns. This is to avoid possible  errors in the future when string sampling is supported. In addition to that keeping the columns means the same filters that are applied to a table can be applied to a sample without having to re-write the columns. 

Currently there are regressions on the ingestion benchmark, but I am in the process of verifying these regressions on different machine types and scale factors. Currently I believe the regressions only take place for smaller dataset sizes on smaller machine types.

This PR also adds a `pragma_table_sample` function so that the sample can be queried and verified.
