Title: DuckDB export Parquet to S3 multi-part has some issues
Description:
### What happens?

> *Disclaimer* I'm using DigitalOcean's S3-compliant cloud storage for these tests

# **Issue 1** - `PER_THREAD_OUTPUT` only works if you specify `OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE`

```py
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("INSTALL httpfs;")
con.execute("LOAD httpfs;")
con.execute(f"""CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE S3,
    ENDPOINT '{settings.s3.endpoint}',   # <bucket>.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
    KEY_ID '{settings.s3.access_key}',   # DOxxxxxxxxx
    SECRET '{settings.s3.secret_key}',   # i4xxxxxxxxxx
    URL_STYLE 'path'
);""")

query = f"""
    COPY (
        SELECT *
        FROM read_parquet(['/tmp/2025-01-07_rift_reddit_r_bitcoin_fgvchn03/data_0.parquet'], union_by_name = true)
        LIMIT 500
    ) TO 's3://datasets/test/' (FORMAT PARQUET, PER_THREAD_OUTPUT);
"""
res = con.execute(query)
```

This results in the error:

```
HTTP Error: HTTP GET error on '/datasets/?encoding-type=url&list-type=2&prefix=test%2F' (HTTP 404)
```

> *Workaround:* as I mention in the title, add `OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE` after `PER_THREAD_OUTPUT`

# **Issue 2** - Adding additional `/` to the output path

Running the same code as above, but this time with `TO 's3://datasets/test/' (FORMAT PARQUET, PER_THREAD_OUTPUT, OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE)` writes the data to `s3://datasets/test//`

This is a weird one and might be an issue within DO instead of duckdb because the folder name literally becomes `/` so using their web UI, I have to click on `datasets` to open the datasets folder and then I have to click on `/` to open its folder from there I can see the `data_0.parquet` file.  Again, really weird.

> *Workaround:* change the output path to `'s3://datasets/test'`
