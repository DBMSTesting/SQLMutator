Title: Feature #1272: Window Constant Sink
Description:
Parallelise the Sink and Finalize phases of WindowConstantAggregator
by passing local aggregation states to the Sink
and Finalize operations. This allows us to use the
typical update/combine/finalize sequence for parallel
aggregate evaluation.

It also factors out the multiply copied and pasted
statef construct of states and pointers along with
their operations into a wrapper class that manages
memory corectly and is simpler to use.

With this change, the single-threaded Finalize lock
for the aggregate executor has been pushed down
one level into the accelerators because the constant
accelerator no longer needs it.

(Also fixed some annoying clangd cast warnings.)
