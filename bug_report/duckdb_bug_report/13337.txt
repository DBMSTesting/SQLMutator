### What happens?

Hi, 
I am using Duckdb in Termux on my Android phone. When I want to install sqlite support to open the sqlite database, I get the following error. Thanks in advance for your help in resolving it.

```
duckdb
v1.0.0 1f98600
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

D install sqlite;

HTTP Error: Failed to download extension "sqlite_scanner" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.0.0/linux_arm64_android/sqlite_scanner.duckdb_extension.gz"
Extension "sqlite_scanner" is an existing extension.
