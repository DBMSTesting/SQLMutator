Title: Parquet reader: rename metadata cache setting to `parquet_metadata_cache`, and avoid using it for stats
Description:
This PR renames the parquet metadata cache setting to the more descriptive `parquet_metadata_cache`:

```sql
SET parquet_metadata_cache=true;
```

In addition, we no longer use the metadata cache for propagating column statistics. Previously, we would try to use metadata stored in the cache to propagate column statistics - but this could cause large slowdowns when scanning many files because (1) the code to obtain the stats from the metadata was not optimized, and this could happen `number_of_files * number_of_columns` times, and (2) we would open each file to check if the file had not gone stale before doing this - which could again cause many file system operations. This could cause large slowdowns when enabling the metadata cache. 

This PR just disables this behavior entirely and now uses the metadata cache exclusively to prevent re-reading the metadata from disk. In a future PR we might be able to use the stats again given that we can greatly optimize the code for obtaining the stats.
