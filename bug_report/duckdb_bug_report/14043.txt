Title: Support qualified identifiers in the `EXCLUDE` clause
Description:
Implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/8952

This PR implements support for qualified identifiers in the `EXCLUDE` clause, i.e.:

```sql
SELECT * EXCLUDE (tbl.col) FROM tbl;
```

Fully qualified identifiers are supported (i.e. `db.schema.tbl.col`). Any non-provided identifiers are considered as "matching all", i.e. `i` matches all columns named `i`, `tbl.i` matches all columns named `i` within tables named `tbl`, etc.

In order to preserve backwards compatibility, unqualified identifiers are serialized using the old `case_insensitive_set`. Only qualified identifiers are serialized using the `qualified_column_set`.
