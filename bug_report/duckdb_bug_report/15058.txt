Title: Interrupt query on error in `ClientContext::Query`
Description:
In the C++ API, when providing multiple statements to `ClientContext::Query`, we would return a list of query results for each of the statements. However, we would keep on executing all statements - similar to e.g. the behavior you might expect if you copy-paste a list of statements into a terminal.

In practice, many consumers of `ClientContext::Query` would ignore all but the last result, and it is generally not desirable to continue executing/swallow errors anyway. This PR switches the behavior to instead stop when an error is encountered and return the result containing the error.
