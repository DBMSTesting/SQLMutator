Title: fix for the issue 2698
Description:
This PR should fix the fuzzer [issue](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-fuzzer/issues/2698).

@Maxxen helped me find out that the assertion failed because it received a vector of an unexpected type (expected VectorType::CONSTANT_VECTOR, but got VectorType::FLAT_VECTOR) and provided me with the fix.
