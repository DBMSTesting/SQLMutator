Title: Error when sniffing csv escape char for > 2048 rows
Description:
### What happens?

I have a 2049-line .csv containing:

```
id,value
1,a
2,a
3,a
...
2047,a
2048,""","
```

Note the last value contains what I believe is the RFC 4180-compliant representation of `",`. duckdb v1.2.0 fails to read this file with `read_csv`/`sniff_csv` giving

```
Invalid Input Error:
Error when sniffing file "sniff_test.csv".
It was not possible to automatically detect the CSV Parsing dialect/types
The search space used was:
Delimiter Candidates: ',', '|', ';', '  '
Quote/Escape Candidates: ['"','"'],['"','(no escape)'],['"','''],['"','\'],[''','\'],['(no quote)','(no escape)']
Comment Candidates: '#', '\0'
Possible fixes:
* Disable the parser's strict mode (strict_mode=false) to allow reading rows that do not comply with the CSV standard.
* Set delimiter (e.g., delim=',')
* Set quote (e.g., quote='"')
* Set escape (e.g., escape='"')
* Set comment (e.g., comment='#')
* Set skip (skip=${n}) to skip ${n} lines at the top of the file
* Enable ignore errors (ignore_errors=true) to ignore potential errors
* Enable null padding (null_padding=true) to pad missing columns with NULL values
* Check you are using the correct file compression, otherwise set it (e.g., compression = 'zstd')
* Be sure that the maximum line size is set to an appropriate value, otherwise set it (e.g., max_line_size=10000000)
```

However, if I delete any of the rows where value='a' (bringing the row count < 2048), the file is read successfully. I cannot overcome this error by setting a large `sample_size` parameter. (Interestingly when I use `sample_size=-1`, the process seems to hang.) I can work around the error by setting `escape='"'`, but that is surprising since `"` is the default value of `escape` according to the docs.

### To Reproduce

```
duckdb -c "from read_csv('sniff_test.csv')"
```
