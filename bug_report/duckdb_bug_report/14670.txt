Title: CSV Reader - 4 byte delimiters
Description:
This PR introduces support for delimiters of up to 4 bytes in the CSV Reader. I chose 4 bytes primarily to allow ğŸ¦† to be used as a delimiter :-)

The parsing is implemented by adding intermediate states in the state machine to handle these specific extra bytes.

The PR includes several tests to verify that repeated character patterns (e.g., ABAC) are correctly parsed, and that multi-byte delimiters are properly handled in cases where values span multiple buffers.

I'm happy to add more tests if anyone has additional ideas for interesting edge cases to stress-test.
