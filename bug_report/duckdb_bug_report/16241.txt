Title: Niclas/delete copy constructor
Description:
Having a non-deleted copy constructor allows me to write the following code, which crashes

```cpp
DuckDB duckdb(nullptr);
Connection con(duckdb);
auto pending = con.PendingQuery("FROM range(1000)");
auto pending2 = *pending;

pending2.Execute(); // Crashes -> Attempting to execute an unsuccessful or closed pending query result
```
