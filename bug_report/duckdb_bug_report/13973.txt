Title: fix: remove http prefix from proxy value when present
Description:
DuckDB currently throws the following [error](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/src/common/http_util.cpp#L21) for http_proxy values formatted as `http://<proxy_fqdn>:<proxy_port>`:

`InvalidInputException("Failed to parse http_proxy '%s' into a host and port", proxy_value)`

This PR creates a copy of the `proxy_value` argument within `HTTPUtil::ParseHTTPProxyHost` and removes the `http://` prefix if it is present before parsing the hostname and port. It also includes a unit test to cover this new condition.
