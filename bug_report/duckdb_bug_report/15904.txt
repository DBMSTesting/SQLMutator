Title: In destructor try/catch exceptions thrown when closing MiniZ streams
Description:
This happens from time to time in Regression runner, with failure mode:
```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'duckdb::Exception'
  what():  {'exception_type':'IO','exception_message':'Failed to decode gzip stream: data error'}
```

I am not sure why miniz throws `data error`, possibly there is something there, but this should not terminate duckdb.

I don't have a way to test this either way, it's mostly an hypothesis but the code added should be OK.
