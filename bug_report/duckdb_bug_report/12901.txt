Title: CREATE TABLE: inconsistent quote handling with enum column?
Description:
### What happens?

When using an `ENUM` column in a `CREATE TABLE` statement, it behaves weird. I'd expect the quotes to be completely optional as long as the schema/table/type identifiers don't contain special characters.

### To Reproduce

```sql
-- works
CREATE SCHEMA "foo";
CREATE TYPE "foo.bar" AS ENUM ('a', 'b');
CREATE TABLE foo.baz (
	bar_col "foo.bar" NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
-- does not work
CREATE SCHEMA "foo";
CREATE TYPE foo.bar AS ENUM ('a', 'b');
CREATE TABLE foo.baz (
	bar_col "foo.bar" NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
-- does not work either
CREATE SCHEMA "foo";
CREATE TYPE "foo.bar" AS ENUM ('a', 'b');
CREATE TABLE foo.baz (
	bar_col foo.bar NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
-- does not work either
CREATE SCHEMA "foo";
CREATE TYPE foo.bar AS ENUM ('a', 'b');
CREATE TABLE foo.baz (
	bar_col foo.bar NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
-- does not work either
CREATE SCHEMA "foo";
CREATE TYPE "foo".bar AS ENUM ('a', 'b');
CREATE TABLE foo.baz (
	bar_col "foo".bar NOT NULL
);
```
