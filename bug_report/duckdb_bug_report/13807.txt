Title: Misleading error message when importing JSON with upper/lowercased keys
Description:
### What happens?

When importing json with keys that only differ by case, we can get this message:
```
Not implemented Error: Duplicate name "Name" in struct auto-detected in JSON, try ignore_errors=true
```
This can be misleading and confusing, since the proplem is really that there are two different keys that differ only in their case.

### To Reproduce

```sql
create table test as select * from read_json('test.json', format='auto', ignore_errors=false);
```

where `test.json` has

```json
[
  {
  "keyA" : [
        {"name": "foo"},
        {"Name": "bar"}
        ]
  }
]
```
