Title: Failed to download Postgres extension
Description:
### What happens?

The OSX nightly build for yesterday completed successfully so I downloaded the cli using the following link from the installation web page. I then proceeded to install postgres, as I always do, and was surprised to see that it couldn't find the extension despite the job having succeeded.


### To Reproduce

Download the CLI using the link on the installation page of the website.
https://artifacts.duckdb.org/latest/duckdb-binaries-osx.zip
Extract and run duckdb.
```
install postgres;
Failed to download extension "postgres_scanner" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/067ecb1c7f/osx_arm64/postgres_scanner.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 403)
```
