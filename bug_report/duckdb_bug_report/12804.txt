Title: `last()` in window function does not return last value
Description:
### What happens?

The window function [`last()`](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/window_functions#lastexpr-ignore-nulls) does not return the last value of a window. 

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb
import pandas as pd

df_pd = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(
    {
        "client": ["fa", "fa", "fa", "fa"],
        "doc": [
            "2013-12-04T14:38:59Z",
            "2013-12-04T14:47:51Z",
            "2014-04-14T07:20:00Z",
            "2014-09-24T12:55:55Z",
        ],
        "status": ["TP5", "TP7", "TP7", "TP7"],
    }
)

duckdb.sql(
    """
    SELECT
        client,
        doc,
        status, 
        status!=lag(status) OVER (PARTITION BY client ORDER BY doc) AS transition,
        last(status) OVER (PARTITION BY client ORDER BY doc) AS latestStatus
    FROM df_pd
    ORDER BY client, doc
"""
).fetchall()
```

```shell
[('fa', '2013-12-04T14:38:59Z', 'TP5', None, 'TP5'),
 ('fa', '2013-12-04T14:47:51Z', 'TP7', True, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2014-04-14T07:20:00Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2014-09-24T12:55:55Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP7')]
```

Now with descending order for `doc`

```python
duckdb.sql(
    """
    SELECT
        client,
        doc,
        status, 
        status!=lag(status) OVER (PARTITION BY client ORDER BY doc) AS transition,
        last(status) OVER (PARTITION BY client ORDER BY doc DESC) AS latestStatus
    FROM df_pd
    ORDER BY client, doc
"""
).fetchall()
```

Same result:

```shell
[('fa', '2013-12-04T14:38:59Z', 'TP5', None, 'TP5'),
 ('fa', '2013-12-04T14:47:51Z', 'TP7', True, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2014-04-14T07:20:00Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2014-09-24T12:55:55Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP7')]
```

If I replace `last` with `first` for both `ORDER BY doc ASC` and `ORDER BY doc DESC` the behaviour is as expect:

```shell
[('fa', '2013-12-04T14:38:59Z', 'TP5', None, 'TP5'),
 ('fa', '2013-12-04T14:47:51Z', 'TP7', True, 'TP5'),
 ('fa', '2014-04-14T07:20:00Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP5'),
 ('fa', '2014-09-24T12:55:55Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP5')]
```

and

```shell
[('fa', '2013-12-04T14:38:59Z', 'TP5', None, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2013-12-04T14:47:51Z', 'TP7', True, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2014-04-14T07:20:00Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP7'),
 ('fa', '2014-09-24T12:55:55Z', 'TP7', False, 'TP7')]
```
respectively.
