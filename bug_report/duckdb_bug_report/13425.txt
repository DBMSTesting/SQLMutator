Title: [Arrow] Accept objects that provide the `__arrow_c_stream__` producer method
Description:
This PR is also related to #10716

The interface specifies that `__arrow_c_stream__` should be used to produce a PyCapsule, so we can check for any object that has this method.

Then we'll create the capsule from it and from that point on we can treat it as if the capsule itself was provided.
