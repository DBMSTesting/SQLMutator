Title: Fix #13867: use 64-bit random numbers to generate random numbers for `random()`
Description:
Fixes #13867

Previously we were generating 32-bit random numbers for `random()`, and using that to return a `double`. This PR modifies this behavior so that we instead generate a 64-bit random number. This ensures we don't run into repeated numbers when generating a low amount of random numbers. Note that this changes the random numbers that are generated with specific seeds, hence this requires changing a number of tests.
