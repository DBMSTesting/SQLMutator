Title: Fix the seed of RandomLocalState to be 64bit instead of 32bits
Description:
This is connected to raising RandomEngine to use 64bit state, see https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13920, but initialization need to be done on full range otherwise entropy is limited when many repeated statement are executed.

Note that here we only solve the problem for RandomLocalState.
A wider rework of the RandomEngine API would also be also handy, since currently it takes a int64_t that can be either invalid (-1) or valid (>=0), but out of scope here given interactions with sampling PRs make it a larger change.
