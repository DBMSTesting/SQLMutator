Title: read_csv: Confusing / inconsistent error message when passing 'MAP' entry in auto_type_candidates parameter
Description:
### What happens?

When using the `auto_type_candidates` option to `read_csv` and passing in an entry `'MAP'` we get a confusing error message that also points to the wrong line - at least from the perspective of the user (I think the line number refers to a sql statement ran internally inside the csv reader, not to the context of the statement submitted by the user.)

I know that `auto_type_candidates` does not accept just any data type name, but I think passing in an unqualified 'LIST' is functionally similar and that does result in a sensible error message.

### To Reproduce

```sql
WITH
  cte1 AS (
    SELECT 1
  ),
  cte2 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM read_csv('all_types_test.csv', auto_type_candidates=['MAP'])
  )
SELECT * 
FROM cte2;
```
[all_types_test.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16479247/all_types_test.csv)

results in this error:

```
Parser Error: syntax error at or near ")"
LINE 4: )
```
This is just not correct. We can take lines 1..4 and do a select on ct1 and it executes so whatever is the matter, it cannot be a Parser Error on line 4.

As you can see, 

Passing in the - also unsupported - 'LIST' datatype returns a more sensible message:

`Parser Error: LIST is not valid as a stand-alone type`
