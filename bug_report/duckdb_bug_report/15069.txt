Title: current_date & current_time PostgreSQL incompatibility 
Description:
### What happens?

I opened a PR to the duckdb docs (https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-web/pull/4206) stating current incompatibilty in the `current_date` and `current_time` pseudo-columns.

Usually, when duckdb differs from PostgreSQL it's for reasons I support. In this case, I think PostgreSQL's behavior is clearly better, so I wanted to raise this as an issue before it's enshrined into the docs.

DuckDB isn't even consistent within itself! `current_timestamp` returns a `TIMESTAMPTZ` and `current_localtimestamp()` a `TIMESTAMP` -- perfect --, but `current_time` returns a `TIME` while `current_localtime()` correctly returns a `TIME`. Clearly, `current_time` should return a `TIMETZ` like PostgreSQL does.

Also, there is no `current_localdate()` to get the correct local date (and that'd be perfectly fine if `current_date` did what it was supposed to; nobody needs to know the `current_date` in UTC, and if they were sure they absolutely did need to know, they could achieve that by setting their timezone or by using `timezone('UTC', current_timestamp)::DATE`)

### To Reproduce

```sql
SET TimeZone = 'Asia/Novosibirsk';
SELECT current_date, current_time, current_timestamp 
```
```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│ current_date │ current_time │     current_timestamp      │
│     date     │     time     │  timestamp with time zone  │
├──────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────────────┤
│ 2024-11-30   │ 21:13:31.918 │ 2024-12-01 04:13:31.918+07 │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```
