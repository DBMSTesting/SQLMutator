Title: update duckdb-binaries-windows to use duckdb_arch as a suffix
Description:
Currently, the naming pattern for DuckDB binaries for `duckdb-binaries-windows` is inconsistent with the naming pattern used for DuckDB builds for another platforms, because it doesn't come from the `duckdb_arch` variable:
```
duckdb-binaries-osx_arm64
duckdb-binaries-osx_amd64
duckdb-binaries-windows-amd64
duckdb-binaries-windows-arm64
duckdb-binaries-linux_amd64
duckdb-binaries-linux_arm64
```

This PR makes it use `duckdb_arch` variable in binaries names
