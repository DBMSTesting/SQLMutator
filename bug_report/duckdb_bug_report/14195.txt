Title: add method to check whether julia connection is open
Description:
This PR adds methods (previously implemented only for `DuckDB.DB`) to check whether a connection is open using `Base.isopen` and to close it using `Base.close`. It is consistent with `DuckDB.DB` and is also what other julia DB packages do (e.g. [MySQL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDatabases/MySQL.jl/blob/9d61afbc137284b830b259a873f50c028c30615b/src/MySQL.jl#L306)).
