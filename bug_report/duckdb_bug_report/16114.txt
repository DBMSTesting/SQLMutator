Title: [Dev] MultiFileReader fix InternalError in CreateFilterMap
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/16094

First this was using `global_columns`, this list of columns is what the Reader is aware of, in this case the Parquet reader.
This list is influenced by the `schema` parameter.

`global_column_ids` comes from the `TableFunctionInitInput`, and will also contain artificial/generated columns like "filename"
