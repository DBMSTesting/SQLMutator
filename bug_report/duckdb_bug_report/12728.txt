Title: [CSV] Progress Bar for compressed files.
Description:
When scanning compressed files, we use a different strategy to check for progress.

Instead of counting the bytes our CSV scanners have scanned from the file and comparing that to the total file size, we use the file handle to tell us how far we are on that file.
