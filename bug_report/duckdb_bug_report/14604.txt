Title: Unexpected result comparing blob
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14567
and https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3373

the memory was compared correctly, but the tie was not broken correctly. With some help from @lnkuiper, I realized that `Comparators:TieIsBreakable` needs to do a length check from BLOB types. In addition, the length check needs to happen for the LHS and RHS.
