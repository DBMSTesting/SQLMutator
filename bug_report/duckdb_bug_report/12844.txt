Title: Fix an issue where parameters would be promoted to `NULL`, incorrectly causing `PREPARE` to fail
Description:
e.g. the following query would fail because of the mixing of `NULL` and `UNKNOWN` turning into `NULL`, which would then bind the division operator to `INTERVAL / BIGINT` causing a strange error.

```sql
D PREPARE v1 AS SELECT COALESCE(COALESCE(NULL, $1) / 42::BIGINT, 0.5);
-- Binder Error: Cannot mix values of type INTERVAL and DECIMAL(2,1) in COALESCE operator - an explicit cast is required
```

This PR changes the behavior so that `COALESCE(NULL, UNKNOWN)` results in `UNKNOWN`, which then causes a rebind to happen when the parameter type is known.

In addition, we also fix an issue in `ToString()` of functions so that functions that contain special characters are correctly quoted.
