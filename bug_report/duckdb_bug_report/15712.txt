Title: wrong result for string_agg(distinct ... order by ...)
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB does not handle the combination of `string_agg(distinct` with `order by` correctly. Presumably it uses a sort based duplicate elimination, but then it does not check if the values are indeed sorted correctly. See example below.

Most likely DuckDB should refuse to execute queries where sort order does not correspond to aggregated values (at least that is what Postgres does), but DuckDB accepts the query and silently produces duplicates.

### To Reproduce

DuckDB produces a wrong result for the following query:

`select string_agg(distinct x-y order by x) from (values(1,0),(2,0),(3,2)) s(x,y)`

It should produce a duplicate free list of values (e.g., `1,2`), but the result contains duplicates (i.e., `1,2,1`).
