Title: [Fix] Improve memory allocation in physical insert
Description:
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14254 introduced new `DataChunk` functions that take an `initialize` vector to skip vector cache allocation if unnecessary. It also passes a `count` to most `Initialize` calls, if feasible.

This PR uses the same functionality for the data chunks used in the local state of the physical insert. This improves, e.g., `INSERT OR REPLACE` time in the presence of nested columns.

Fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3843.
