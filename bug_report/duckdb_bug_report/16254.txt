Title: Inline ListLambdaBindData methods
Description:
Im not sure exactly why, but somehow the rust linux build broke at the linking step after upgrading to v1.2.0, complaining about missing typeinfo for the ListLambdaBindData. ... I think this is because the destructor/virtual methods are not present in the resulting unity build for planner/expression? 

Either way, moving them to the header seems to resolve it on my private fork. Here the compilation succeeds, although there are some test failures as I had to bump the tag to get the rust build script to work (you can't just give it a branch/commit) https://github.com/Maxxen/duckdb-rs/actions/runs/13346304316/job/37277138519

The annoying thing with the rust client is that it requires checking out a versioned tag of the duckdb source tree, so Im not sure how to get this patch applied over there, but we can figure that out separately. Otherwise it's going to be fixed when we bump to v1.2.1 in a couple weeks.
