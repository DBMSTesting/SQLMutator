Title: Pull up filters from and through explicit joins
Description:
We can specify the same query equivalently either as:
```sql
select count(*)
from lineitem l,
     orders o1,
     orders o2
where l.l_orderkey = o1.o_orderkey
  and l.l_orderkey = o2.o_orderkey
```
Or as:
```sql
select count(*)
from lineitem l
join orders o1
on (l.l_orderkey = o1.o_orderkey)
join orders o2
on (l.l_orderkey = o2.o_orderkey)
```
In the first query, we would derive that `o1.o_orderkey = o2.o_orderkey` and join `o1` and `o2` first. In the second case, we wouldn't derive this because we didn't pull the condition out of explicitly `JOIN`ed relations, and we'd end up with a different (worse) join order.

This PR fixes this by pulling these conditions up out of `LogicalComparisonJoin` and `LogicalAnyJoin` in `FilterPullup`.
