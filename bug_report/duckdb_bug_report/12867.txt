Title: INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE only lists first column of composite keys
Description:
### What happens?

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` view doesn't list all columns of composite keys

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE a (a1 int, a2 int, PRIMARY KEY (a1, a2));
CREATE TABLE b (a1 int, a2 int, FOREIGN KEY (a1, a2) REFERENCES a);

SELECT * FROM information_schema.key_column_usage;
```

This only lists `a1` for each table, not both columns:

```
|constraint_catalog|constraint_schema|constraint_name|table_catalog|table_schema|table_name|column_name|ordinal_position|position_in_unique_constraint|
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
|duckdb-dummy      |main             |b_a1_fkey      |duckdb-dummy |main        |b         |a1         |1               |1                            |
|duckdb-dummy      |main             |a_a1_pkey      |duckdb-dummy |main        |a         |a1         |1               |                             |
```

As a workaround, at least for the primary keys, this query could be used:

```sql
SELECT constraint_column_names FROM duckdb_constraints();
```

But since the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE.CONSTRAINT_NAME` is just a made up identifier that doesn't really exist in the catalog, it's not possible to formally correlate `DUCKDB_CONSTRAINTS()` results with `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` results (or also `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS`), except if the constraint is the only one of its type on a given table (e.g. the primary key).
