Title: Parquet read : Invalid decimal encoding in Parquet file
Description:
### What happens?

I encounter the following error when I read a parquet that contain a `DECIMAL(17, 4)` column with a python script running on Linux.
The same error occurs on windows using DBeaver tool to read the Parquet file ith a DuckDB connection.
I precise that the file has been extracted from a DB2/AS400 system with Talend ETL tool.
I have no issue to open the file with another parquet viewer.

```text
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: Attempting to execute an unsuccessful or closed pending query result
Error: Invalid Input Error: Invalid decimal encoding in Parquet file
```

The file to test is attached to the issue.
