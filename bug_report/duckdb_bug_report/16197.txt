Title: Ensure that dependent targets are present after find_package.
Description:
DuckDBConfig.cmake.in:

* Ensure that Threads::Threads is available with find_dependency, as it is unconditionally used: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/60c94425622338fc47ffcd646dd5181f734d364d/CMakeLists.txt#L25

* If external ICU is selected, ensure that its targets are available.
