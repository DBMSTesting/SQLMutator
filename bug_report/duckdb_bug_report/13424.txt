Title: `duckdb.from_arrow` fails with string_view data types
Description:
### What happens?

When calling `from_arrow` on a pyarrow table with a string view column, import fails. 

From the Git blame it looks like support for this was implemented 6 months ago:
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/4e3a192ce94a793510f11b598805f104d7531c15/src/function/table/arrow.cpp#L88-L89

But given that duckdb 1.0.0 was released in June, there might be a different bug here.

### To Reproduce

```py
import polars as pl
import duckdb
import pyarrow as pa

df = pl.DataFrame({"a": ["a", "b", "c"]})
table = pa.table(df)
print(table)
```
```
pyarrow.Table
a: string_view
----
a: [["a","b","c"]]
```

```py
duckdb.from_arrow(table)
```
raises

```

This is with polars 1.4.1, duckdb 1.0.0, pyarrow 17.0.0, Python 3.11.4.
