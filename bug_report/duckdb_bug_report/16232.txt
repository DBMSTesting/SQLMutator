Title: chore: Add context for progress callback creation function
Description:
Currently, in the R client, the progress bar can only be globally on or off. We need this to support different progress bar callbacks for each connection.

The client context changes. Could this still target v1.2.1, or do we need to wait for v1.3.0?
