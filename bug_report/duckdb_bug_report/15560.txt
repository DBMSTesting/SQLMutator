Title: Update progress_bar.cpp / drop DUCKDB_DISABLE_PRINT macro
Description:
#ifndef DUCKDB_DISABLE_PRINT seems redundant since it is already  used in printer.cpp and it prevents from using a display set via config.create_display_func when compiled with flag -DDUCKDB_DISABLE_PRINT, like the duckdb-r package, where I'm trying to implement a display.

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/src/common/printer.cpp
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/pull/951

PrintProgress  -> TerminalProgressBarDisplay::Update -> TerminalProgressBarDisplay::PrintProgressInternal -> Printer::RawPrint and there is a macro there.

Plus there is already a config option to enable_progress_bar and default is FALSE.

So. Can it be remove?
