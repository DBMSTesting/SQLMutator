Title: Underscore string comparison is not working as expected
Description:
### What happens?

I was trying to pull some strings where '_' (underscore) is part of. 
I tried using query as mentioned below, but query was returning no records. 
I tried running similar query in Hive and it returned records.




### To Reproduce

To reproduce 
```
with src as 
(
  select 'a_bb_c' col 
  union all
  select 'a_b_c' col
  union all
  select 'a_bd_c' col
)
select *
from src 
where col like '%\_b\_%'
-- where col like '%[_]b[_]%'

```
expected output >> **a_b_c**
actual output >> No records
