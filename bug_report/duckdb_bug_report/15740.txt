Title: Unable to use SELECT statements with a View; or JOIN with a View. in duckdb-swift
Description:
### What happens?

The Swift API is working well for many SQL statements, including CREATE VIEW.

If I try to SELECT from a view or SELECT from a table, with a JOIN to a view it fails.

I've tested this with an in memory db and also with a motherduck db.

I can perform the statements directly from either the CLI or through motherduck. Other statements like SELECT from a Table all work fine.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT FROM any_view;
```

```
SELECT * FROM your_table
JOIN any_view
ON your_table.id = any_view.id;
```
