Title: ParserException: Parser Error: syntax error at or near "COPY" when using WITH clause
Description:
### What happens?

It seems that the COPY statement does not accept the WITH clause.

### To Reproduce

The following works:
```sql
COPY ( select 42 as x ) TO 'file.parquet';
COPY ( select * from 'file.parquet' limit 10 ) TO 'test.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet');
```
But any `WITH` in the query leads to a `ParserException`
```sql
with inputdata as ( select * from 'file.parquet' limit 10 )
COPY (select * from inputdata) TO 'test.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet');
```
(even if the with does not relate to COPY statement)
