Title: Add explicit cases to switches: needs FIXME
Description:
This is very much a draft, there are two big `FIXME` that needs addressing, possibly by someone else.

I split the first commit into a separate [PR](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13760), since that's already ready to go in as is.
