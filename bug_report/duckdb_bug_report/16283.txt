Title: Overflow strings allocations: avoid rounding up memory allocated per overflow string - when reading "small" overflow strings place them directly into the vector instead
Description:
Fixes #16277

Overflow strings are not necessarily extremely large - they can be relatively small (e.g. 8~16KB each) - since also for those small-ish strings we cannot fit 2048 onto a single page. In the current code for reading overflow strings from disk we allocate at least a block per overflow string - but for these small overflow strings that is very wasteful. This PR modifies this behavior to place overflow strings that are smaller than a block directly into the string vector instead of allocating a dedicated memory block for each of them.
