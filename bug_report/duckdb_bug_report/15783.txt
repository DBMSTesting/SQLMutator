Title: CSV reader with `new_line:='\r\n'` should reject file with bare `\r` unless `rfc_4180:=false`
Description:
### What happens?

CSV reader should reject file with bare `\r` unless `rfc_4180:=false`, but instead treats it as a line separator and returns a broken line.

### To Reproduce

```python
from duckdb import query

with open("/tmp/test.csv", "w") as f:
    f.write("""one\rtwo""")

query(r"""
SELECT * FROM read_csv('/tmp/test.csv', new_line:='\r\n', rfc_4180:=true)
""")
```
```
┌─────────┐
│   one   │
│ varchar │
├─────────┤
│ wo      │
└─────────┘
```
