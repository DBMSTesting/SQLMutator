Title: [Arrow] Add `PhysicalArrowBatchCollector`, a batched result collector for the `ArrowQueryResult`
Description:
This PR is a sequel to #12496 

This result collector derives from the `PhysicalBatchCollector`, the only addition it makes on top is a `Finalize` step, which runs after all the local states have been merged and internally we contain a `BatchedDataCollection`.

The added finalize step creates an event which produces tasks that can be executed in parallel.
Every task is assigned a set of record batches to populate, no communication between tasks has to take place.

Similar to before (#12496), the benefit we gain here is that the conversion from DuckDB's execution format (DataChunk) to `ArrowArray` is now done in parallel instead of being single threaded.
