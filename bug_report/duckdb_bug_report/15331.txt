Title: Feature #12699: RANK Secondary Sorts
Description:
* Use a WindowTokenTree to implement secondary sorting for RANK/PERCENT_RANK window functions.
* Tokens are dense integer equivalents to sort keys that have the same comparison semantics.
* Tweak the parser to accept `ORDER BY` arguments in zero-argument functions.
* ORDER BY peers to make a better test.
