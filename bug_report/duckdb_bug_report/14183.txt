Title: [Python] Fix a bug with `python_scan_all_frames` reaching the bottom of the frame stack
Description:
This PR fixes #14179

Reaching the bottom of the frame stack (`currentframe.f_back` returns None) was not being detected, causing a python exception instead of reporting a catalog exception.
