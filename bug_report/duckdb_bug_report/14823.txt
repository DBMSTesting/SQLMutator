Title: Optimize PhysicalTopN operator
Description:
If TopNLocalState heap `Finalize()` is called before locking in `PhysicalTopN::Combine()`, the performance of PhysicalTopN operator can improve much, especially in deep paging scenario (i.e., limit + offset is large) because the batching data to sort is large.
# Benchmark
## Environment
- Dataset: TPC-H 100GB
- CPU: 96 core
- Memory: 754 GB
- Test SQL:
```sql
-- shallow paging
select l_orderkey, sum(l_quantity)
from lineitem
group by l_orderkey
order by sum(l_quantity) desc
limit 100 offset 100;

-- deep paging
select l_orderkey, sum(l_quantity)
from lineitem
group by l_orderkey
order by sum(l_quantity) desc
limit 100 offset 1000000;
```
## Result
Time unit: sec
| SQL Type | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| shallow paging | 4.091 | **3.133** |
| deep paging | 29.324 | **10.493** |
