Title: Fix CTEFilterPusher optimization
Description:
The `CTEFilterPusher` introduced with PR #12290 did not work as expected. _E.g._ the following query would crash the system:

```sql
WITH
  a(x) AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT *
    FROM   generate_series(1, 10)
  ),
  b(x) AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT *
    FROM   a
    WHERE  x < 8
  )
SELECT *
FROM   b
WHERE  x % 3 = 1;
```

The problem was, that `FindCandidates` only performs a single pass over the plan tree (which in principle would be great!). The following step `PushFilterIntoCTE`, however, invalidated a bunch of references stored in the `cte_info_map`.

Instead of a single pass over the tree, my proposed change collects all CTEs once, and builds the `cte_info_map` for each CTE separately. Therefore all references are valid when passed down to `PushFilterIntoCTE`. Downside is that we have to traverse the plan tree multiple times. Maybe you (@lnkuiper, @Mytherin ?) have some ideas on how to fix that. But on a positive note, it fixes the problem ðŸ˜„
