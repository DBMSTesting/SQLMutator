Title: Fix extension version to DUCKDB_NORMALIZED_VERSION for in-tree extensions
Description:
Spin off of the comment here: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13591#issuecomment-2314721929, keeping the same logic but making it work in a wider range of cases.

#### On current main
```
git checkout main
git tag v1.0.1
BUILD_JSON=1 BUILD_PARQUET=1 GEN=ninja make
git tag -d v1.0.1
```
here parquet gets the version as `v1.0.1`, while JSON gets the commit's hash.

#### After this PR
```
git checkout fix_extension_version_to_normalized
git tag v1.0.1
BUILD_JSON=1 BUILD_PARQUET=1 GEN=ninja make
git tag -d v1.0.1
```
Both extensions do get `v1.0.1`.

This introduces no changes if not on releases.
Mostly relevant for statically linked extensions when CMake file with configurations are provided externally OR when extensions are specified with `BUILD_JSON=1` (like it's done in the brew build).

We might want to tighten/unify the ways to add extensions-in, but I think having the same uniform behaviour does makes sense.
