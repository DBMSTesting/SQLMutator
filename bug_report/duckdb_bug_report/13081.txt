Title: [CSV Reader] Fix when reading overbuffer values of csv files with extra delimiter
Description:
This PR has a fix to properly read overbuffer rows of files that have one extra delimiter.

Although not directly related to this problem, I've also encountered a race condition on the CSV Error Handler, and fixed that.
