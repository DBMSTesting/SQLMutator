Hello there,  I have a weird situation I'm not sure I understand.

The attached database has a table called Sales, it was generated through a .NET client using v1.1.0;

In the .NET code the following line is executed:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX sales_idx ON Sales (CalendarID,ItemID,CountryID,ChannelDemandID,PriceType);
```

If I open up the creates database in the CLI/DBeaver and run the following I will see duplicates :
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE CalendarID = 202526 AND ItemID = 550;
```

However if I also run : 
```sql
INSERT INTO Sales (CalendarID,itemID,CountryID,ChannelDemandID,PriceType) VALUES (202526,550,1,9,'PROMO');
```

This will fail as expected.  I'm not sure I understand how I can have both duplicates in the table at the same time that I cannot add duplicates.  I have also raised this same issue in the .NET repo.

If I revert the .NET version back to v1.0.2 then the UNIQUE INDEX works as expected but this still raises the issue of how a valid duckdb file can be generated that shows this issue.

Many thanks
