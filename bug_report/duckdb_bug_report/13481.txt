Title: JSON bugfixes and new functions
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13436. Now, the extraction result should be the same whether the path is constant or not.

After a discussion in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13437, I've decided to revert the behavior implemented in #6779 to allow JSON `null` and SQL `NULL` to be distinguished again.

I've also implemented `json_exists` that returns `true` if the supplied path exists in the JSON, and `false` otherwise. I saw that BigQuery also supports the `json_value` function that is essentially the same as `json_extract`, except it sets the result to `NULL` if the JSON at the supplied path is not a scalar value.
