Title: Creating invalid foreign key gives internal error
Description:
### What happens?

Creating a foreign key that references a view gives an `InternalException: INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL!` instead of an error message.


### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE vdata AS SELECT * FROM (VALUES ('v2',)) v(id);
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM vdata;
CREATE TABLE t(
        v_id TEXT,
        FOREIGN KEY (v_id) REFERENCES v (id),
    );
```
