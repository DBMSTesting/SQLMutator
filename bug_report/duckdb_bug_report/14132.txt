Title: Out of memory on basic hash aggregations with large values/aggregates
Description:
### What happens?

We see persistent out of memory issues with certain hash aggregations and hash joins for slightly bigger data sets, which also reproduce on surprisingly simple queries.

The problem occurs if there are many groups and the values/aggregates, rather than the keys, are of non-trivial size (strings, geometries, etc.). The spilling to disk seems no longer effective in avoiding memory_limit.

Possibly by design, but it's a very common scenario. 

### To Reproduce

Example with 100M MD5 values, distinct on, Parquet:
```sql
copy (select s a, md5(s::text) b from generate_series(1,100_000_000) as g(s)) to '/tmp/test.parquet';
set memory_limit to '4GB';
select distinct on (a) b from '/tmp/test.parquet' limit 10;
```
```consoke
Out of Memory Error: could not allocate block of size 256.0 KiB (3.7 GiB/3.7 GiB used)
```

Example with 1M long string values, group by, DuckDB table:
```sql
create table tbl as select s a, repeat('#', 10_000) b from generate_series(1,1_000_000) as g(s);
set memory_limit to '4GB';
select a, max(b) from tbl group by a limit 10;
```
```console
Out of Memory Error: could not allocate block of size 256.0 KiB (3.7 GiB/3.7 GiB used)
```

Large key small value, e.g. `select distinct on (b) a from '/tmp/test.parquet' limit 10;` works fine.

Using a persistent database with max_temp_directory_size 400GB.
