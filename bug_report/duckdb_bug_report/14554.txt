Title: Helper c-api functions for maps and unions (*)
Description:
While Maps are internally lists of structs (key, val) and Unions are Structs and hence can be accessed directly just using the existing exposed C-API functions, these helpers make it more obvious to an API user who may not know the internal representation of these types.
