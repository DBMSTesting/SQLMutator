Title: Fixup invocation of clang-tidy
Description:
Currently `TIDY_BINARY` env variable is not correctly handled by the underlying python script, resulting in errors like:
```
Failed to get commands: Unable to locate the compiler definition
```
(https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/10169576034/job/28126851633#step:7:61)

while executing clang-tidy on PRs.

Avoid passing down the parameter, that means not using the cache.
But considering we went from running on all files (about 1 hour) to only touched files (likely a few minutes), this should still be a significant improvement.

Ccache can be brough back properly later, for now restoring to working state.


This has been tested on my fork by submitting a irrelevant PR just to check that errors are correctly detected: https://github.com/carlopi/duckdb/actions/runs/10174915732/job/28141516564#step:7:61
