Title: Postgresql incompatbility on tuple operations
Description:
### What happens?

```
select 1 where (1,2)  = (1,2);
select 1 where (1,2) in ((1,2), (3,4));
select 1 where (1,2) in (select 1,2);
```
In DuckDb only the first 2 what is working.

The last one is throwing error of "Binder Error: Subquery returns 2 columns - expected 1 LINE 1: select 1 where (1,2) in (select 1,2)"

The second statement is proving that there are some level of support but the third one is not supported.

NB: original discussion: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/14472

In discussion there are suggested change of `select 1 where (1,2) in (select (1,2))` what is working in DuckDb but failing in PostgreSql (AWS RDS Aurora - PostgreSQL 16.1 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC) 9.5.0, 64-bit)

Postgresql error message: "[42601] ERROR: subquery has too few columns"

### To Reproduce

```
select 1 where (1,2)  = (1,2);
select 1 where (1,2) in ((1,2), (3,4));

select 1 where (1,2) in (select 1,2);

select 1 where (1,2) in (select (1,2))

```
