Title: Support for CSV Encoding (UTF-16 and Latin-1)
Description:
This PR adds support for reading various encodings (in addition to UTF-8) in the CSV Reader.

The mechanism should be relatively easy to extend to other encodings, as the more challenging part is handling the end-of-CSV buffers.

I'm aware of at least two discussions that have requested this feature, specifically #9783 and #9436.

From these requests, I believe we are still missing support for Shift-JIS, though implementing the mapping doesnâ€™t seem very complicated.

I think we should centralize encoding requests in one place and tag it as a 'PRs welcome' issue, as implementing new encodings should be relatively easy (aside from the decoding method itself).
