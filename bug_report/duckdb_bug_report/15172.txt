Title: Invalid Input Error: Secret type 'postgres' not found, when connecting to remote parquet
Description:
### What happens?

When executing a query against a remote parquet file in the DuckDB client with a previously created Persistent Secret it throws the following error:
```shell
Invalid Input Error: Secret type 'postgres' not found, try removing the secret at path 'C:\Users\dwayn\.duckdb\stored_secrets\my_persistent_secret.duckdb_secret'.
```

The parquet query is from the [DuckDB blog entry](https://duckdb.org/2024/05/31/analyzing-railway-traffic-in-the-netherlands) . 

### To Reproduce

Open a new duckdb cli and run the following:
```sql
INSTALL postgres;
LOAD postgres;

CREATE PERSISTENT SECRET my_persistent_secret (
    TYPE POSTGRES,
    HOST 'localhost',
    PORT 5432,
    DATABASE pagila,
    USER 'postgres',
    PASSWORD 'postgres2023'
);
```
Then **`quit`** and open a new instance and run:
```sql
WITH services_per_month AS (
    SELECT
        month("Service:Date") AS month,
        "Stop:Station name" AS station,
        count(*) AS num_services
    FROM 'https://blobs.duckdb.org/nl-railway/services-2023.parquet'
    GROUP BY ALL
)
SELECT month, month_name, array_agg(station) AS top3_stations
FROM (
    SELECT
        month,
        strftime(make_date(2023, month, 1), '%B') AS month_name,
        rank() OVER
            (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY num_services DESC) AS rank,
        station,
        num_services
    FROM services_per_month
    WHERE month BETWEEN 6 AND 8
)
WHERE rank <= 3
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY month;
```
Should generate:
```shell
Invalid Input Error: Secret type 'postgres' not found, try removing the secret at path ...
```

It can also be generated by running:
```sql
CALL duckdb_secrets();
```

To remove the secret:

```sql
INSTALL postgres;
LOAD postgres;
DROP PERSISTENT SECRET my_persistent_secret;
```
Executing the query with the remote parquet will then run to completion.
