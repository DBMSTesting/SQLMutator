Title: PhysicalTableScan: Adapt to allow async behaviour
Description:
Bumped into this while looking to supporting JavaScript async UDF functionality in duckdb-wasm. This is the only duckdb/duckdb change, other fixes to be added on duckdb-wasm side, afterward it can be properly tested there.

I think this also makes sense in general for DuckDB, where an operator can now properly BLOCK and handle resuming on a side. This is particularly relevant for the poll path, expecially when single threaded (since no other work can happen otherwise).

This is at the moment an untested codepath in duckdb/duckdb CI, I need to add a test.
