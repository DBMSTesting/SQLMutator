Title: allow external cardinality information (e.g. from iceberg)
Description:
add a new named_parameter for the parquet_scan() called "explicit_cardinality"

this ubigint is the exact cardinality of the parquet_scan(), which can span multiple files that one may know from external metadata

like the "schema" named_parameter, it is not really public, but intended for duckdb_iceberg
