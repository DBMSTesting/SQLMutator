Title: Verify UTF-8 in `DeltaLengthByteArrayDecoder` and speed it up
Description:
Although Parquet should be valid UTF-8, we can never be sure what other writers do, so we validate this. This validation was already there for `PLAIN`/`RLE_DICTIONARY` encoding but was missing for `DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY`. This PR adds the verification there as well.

Verifying UTF-8 takes is somewhat costly, so I've also worked on speeding it up by checking 8 bytes at a time, instead of 1 byte. This is especially nice for `DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY`, as the strings are stored without their lengths in between, so we can verify many strings in one go.
