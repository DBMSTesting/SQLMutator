Title: allow positional access in named structs
Description:
allow positional access in named structs

the reason why I propose this is not only to allow more flexible access to structs, but I also would like to fix an issue in TableFilter:ToExpression() which in case of predicates on struct members fails to produce a working boolean expression (because, it creates a positional access rather than a key-based one).

It actually also got that position wrong (off by one).
