### To Reproduce

sql is following, and duckdb file send to email: gabor@duckdblabs.com

```sql
create or replace table tmp_full_org_path as

	select

		a.biz_action_type_code, a.operating_unit_sk, a.stockorg_sk send_stockorg_sk, b.stockorg_sk receive_stockorg_sk, 1 send_level,

		case

			when a.scene_type in ('调拨') or (a.scene_type = '补调' and a.org_flag = 1) then 'gto.store_path_rule'

			when a.scene_type in ('补货', '返仓') or (a.scene_type = '补调' and a.org_flag = 2) then 'gto.warehouse_store_path_rule'

		end parameter_code-- select count(*)

	from tmp_skc_org_basic a

	inner join tmp_skc_org_basic b on a.operating_unit_sk = b.operating_unit_sk and a.biz_action_type_code = b.biz_action_type_code and a.skc_sk = b.skc_sk

	where

		case

			when a.scene_type in ('调拨', '返仓') then a.org_flag = 1

			when a.scene_type in ('补货') then a.org_flag = 2

			when a.scene_type in ('补调') then a.org_flag in (1, 2)

		end 

		and

		case

			when a.scene_type in ('补货', '调拨', '补调') then b.org_flag = 1

			when a.scene_type in ('返仓') then b.org_flag = 2

		end 

		and a.stockorg_sk <> b.stockorg_sk

	group by

		a.biz_action_type_code, a.operating_unit_sk, a.stockorg_sk, b.stockorg_sk, a.scene_type, a.org_flag

;
