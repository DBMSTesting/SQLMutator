Title: 40GB table, unable to add index
Description:
### What happens?

I have a 40GB table that I'm trying to add an index to. Duckdb shows progress, usually up to 40-50%, but then the process is killed on its own. I can only tell that maybe it's trying to do all this in memory. Usually, all my RAM is used during the process; I have 64GB installed.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE INDEX firstname_idx ON names (firstname);
```

### OS:

Linux and Windows - both x86_64

### DuckDB Version:

1.1

### DuckDB Client:

duck cli

### Hardware:

_No response_

### Full Name:

Xavier

### Affiliation:

none
