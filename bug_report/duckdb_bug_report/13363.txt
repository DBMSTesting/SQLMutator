Title: Cannot open SQLite database with C API
Description:
### What happens?

According to [Opening SQLite Databases Directly](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/sqlite.html#opening-sqlite-databases-directly) any client should be able to open SQLite database. Moreover, the SQLite extension is autoloadable extension but C API fails to open SQLite database files.

On the other hand, C API downloads and loads the httpfs extension automatically when needed, it's just the SQLite extension that's not downloaded.

Error:

> IO Error: Extension "C:\Users\G.Dalakishvili\.duckdb\extensions\22040decf7\windows_amd64\sqlite_scanner.duckdb_extension" not found.
> Extension "sqlite" is an existing extension.
> 
> Install it first using "INSTALL sqlite".

### To Reproduce

```c
duckdb_create_config(&config);

//This results in error
state = duckdb_open_ext("S:\\sakila.db", &db, config, &error);

std::cout << error << std::endl;

duckdb_open_ext(NULL, &db, config, &error);
duckdb_connect(db, &connection);

//This will download and load httpfs extension
state = duckdb_query(connection, "SELECT * FROM 'hf://datasets/datasets-examples/doc-formats-parquet-1/data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet';", &result);
