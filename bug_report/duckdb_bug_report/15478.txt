Title: Can't return `current_date` from a query
Description:
### What happens?

Returning `current_date` from a query fails with an error about a missing cast.

Most likely introduced in #15069: vendoring versions one by one shows an error when applying that PR to the R package, see the individual checks in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/pull/749.

### To Reproduce

```
✗ echo 'SELECT current_date AS a' | build/debug/duckdb
duckdb(24121,0x1eac14f80) malloc: nano zone abandoned due to inability to reserve vm space.
Conversion Error:
Unimplemented type for cast (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE -> DATE)

LINE 1: SELECT current_date AS a
               ^
```
