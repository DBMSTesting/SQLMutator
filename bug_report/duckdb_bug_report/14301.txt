# NYC Taxi Dataset Regeneration

Basically, I noticed that generating the dataset by following the exact steps described in [this article](https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html) would not work because the TLC has anonymized the latitude and longitude information when converting the datasets to Parquet files.

To address this, I obtained an older version of the data and properly regenerated the dataset.

For example, in a data snippet from this pull request (PR):

```plaintext
649084905,VTS,2012-08-31 22:00:00,2012-08-31 22:07:00,0,1,-73.993908,40.741383000000006,-73.989915,40.75273800000001,1,1.32,6.1,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,7.1,CSH,0,0101000020E6100000E6CE4C309C7F52C0BA675DA3E55E4440,0101000020E610000078B471C45A7F52C06D3A02B859604440,yellow,0.00,0.0,0.0,91,69,4.70,142,54,1,Manhattan,005400,1005400,I,MN13,Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square,3807,132,109,1,Manhattan,010900,1010900,I,MN17,Midtown-Midtown South,3807
```

we see precise longitude and latitude data points: `-73.993908,40.741383000000006,-73.989915,40.75273800000001`, along with a PostGIS Geometry hex blob created from this longitude and latitude information: `0101000020E6100000E6CE4C309C7F52C0BA675DA3E55E4440,0101000020E610000078B471C45A7F52C06D3A02B859604440` (generated using `ST_SetSRID(ST_Point(longitude, latitude), 4326)`).

Since latitude and longitude information is essential to this schema, Iâ€™ve limited the dataset to data up to mid-2016, which is the last period where this information was available.

The final dataset consists of 65 files with a total size of approximately 1.8 GB.
In the end this benchmark also has a few more rides than the one from the billion row blogpost, because in the blogpost the uber rides were excluded and the trips were capped until the end of 2015.
