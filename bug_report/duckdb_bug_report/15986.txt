Title: Explicitly pass and store Allocator into MemoryStream
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15936 - avoid constantly querying the default-allocator and use the one set in the `ClientContext` instead.

For now the previous constructor (not requiring an allocator) is kept - pending removal in the future (this requires changing a few extensions).
