Title: Parquet reader: batch check if buffer is available in RLEBpDecoder
Description:
When reading long chains of `RleBpDecoder` data - `NextCounts` can be called many times. Instead of checking if there is enough buffer available for every byte we can batch check if we are certain we have enough bytes available. The varint that we are reading is limited to max 5 bytes (as more does not fit into a `uint32_t`) so we can just call `check_available` once. This improves performance by ~10% when reading data with many small batches.
