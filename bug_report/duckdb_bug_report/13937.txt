Title: CI: Trigger actions for labeled discussions
Description:
Some discussions such as https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/6727 warrant documentation. I would like to label these with `Needs Documentation` to document it. Also, some discussion should warrant further discussion, so `under review` (and occasionally, `reproduced`) could also be helpful to mirror these issues to the internal issue tracker.
