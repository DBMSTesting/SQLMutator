Title: DuckDB Arrow Non Canonical Extensions to use arrow.opaque
Description:
This PR modifies the handling of DuckDB Arrow non-canonical extensions (e.g., `uhugeint`, `varint`, ...). With these modifications Arrow can now reliably propagate non-canonical extensions without requiring client-specific extension registrations.  

In summary:
   - The extension name for non-canonical types will always be `arrow.opaque`.
   - The type metadata will include:  
     - `vendor_name`: `DuckDB`  
     - `type_name`: the type's specific name.

 The PR also includes some minor refactoring of the map-to-JSON string functionality in `StringUtil`.
