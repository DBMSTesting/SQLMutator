Title: Rejected Rows should at least display an error or warning once csv loaded 
Description:
### What happens?

I added a 'I' intentionally in the input file to determine whether the data is loaded incorrectly or rejected

It seems after selecting the data using the Query below -

There was no Warning or error , the row was rejected 

I do understand as per the documentation under https://duckdb.org/docs/data/csv/reading_faulty_csv_files

The errors can be retrieved or stored but it would be great if there is at least a warning or informational message generated after the select is performed , showing that there were rows rejected , if there are thousands of rows , it could be a scenario where the data is missed
