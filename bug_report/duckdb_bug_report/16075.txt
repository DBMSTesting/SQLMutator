Title: `row_number() OVER ()` 100x slower than `rowid`
Description:
### What happens?

I was  about to recommend the use of `row_number() OVER ()` instead of `rowid` in a discussion, since the former gives the same results as the latter when the latter exists, but is more canonical/less magical and always exists. Alas, `row_number() OVER ()` is 100x slower:

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE df AS (FROM range(1_000_000_000))
```
Then
```sql
SELECT *
FROM df
QUALIFY row_number() OVER () < 11
```
takes 2.5s while
```sql
SELECT *
FROM df
WHERE rowid < 10
```
takes 20ms.
