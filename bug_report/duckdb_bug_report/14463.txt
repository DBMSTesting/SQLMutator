Title: Text arrays not escaped when serialized to text
Description:
### What happens?

When a text array is serialized to text (e.g. during CSV write), the strings are not escaped, which means the serialized string cannot be coherently deserialized.

### To Reproduce

```sql
select ['a,c', 'b']::text as arr;
```
```text
┌──────────┐
│   arr    │
│ varchar  │
├──────────┤
│ [a,c, b] │
└──────────┘
```
```sql
select len(['a,c', 'b']) as before, len(['a,c', 'b']::text::text[]) as after;
```
```text
┌────────┬───────┐
│ before │ after │
│ int64  │ int64 │
├────────┼───────┤
│      2 │     3 │
└────────┴───────┘
```
