Title: "INTERNAL Error: Failed to drop entry ... - could not find entry" and inappropriate invalidation of database
Description:
### What happens?

To reproduce:

1) Download and unzip the "well-known" SQLite database at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer

2) Assuming database.sqlite is in the pwd invoke duckdb and execute the program shown below.

The "INTERNAL Error" message begins:

INTERNAL Error: Failed to drop entry "PlayerStatistics" - could not find entry
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. 

Subsequent read-only operations result in a message:
```
FATAL Error: Failed: database has been invalidated because of a previous fatal error. The database must be restarted prior to being used again.
Original error: "Failed to drop entry "PlayerStats" - could not find entry" 
```

I understand that the SQL program is faulty (the reference to PlayerStats is interpreted as db.PlayerStats), but the error message makes no mention of db or the likelihood that a `USE` is missing); and the invalidation of the database only adds to the confusion (especially as the previous message alluded to an "INTERNAL ERROR") and seems unwarranted. 
### To Reproduce

```
LOAD sqlite;

SET GLOBAL sqlite_all_varchar = true;

ATTACH 'database.sqlite' AS db (TYPE sqlite); USE db; 

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW PlayerStats AS
SELECT * EXCLUDE(rn, id, player_api_id, player_fifa_api_id)
FROM Player
JOIN (
    select *,
           ROW_NUMBER()
           OVER (partition by player_api_id ORDER BY date DESC) rn
    FROM Player_Attributes
) AS attrs
ON attrs.player_api_id = Player.player_api_id AND rn = 1;

```
produces:
```
INTERNAL Error: Failed to drop entry "PlayerStatistics" - could not find entry
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. 
```
