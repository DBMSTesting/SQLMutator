Title: Query unnesting with grouping sets results in wrong output
Description:
### What happens?

The following two queries should return the same result:
```sql
select x, a, b
from
(values (1), (2)) t2(x),
lateral (select count(*), count(a) from (select 1, 2 where 1 = x) t(a, b) group by grouping sets ((), (b), (a, b))) t3(a, b);

select x, a, b
from
(
select 1, count(*), count(a) from (select 1, 2 where 1 = 1) t(a, b) group by grouping sets ((), (b), (a, b))
union all
select 2, count(*), count(a) from (select 1, 2 where 1 = 2) t(a, b) group by grouping sets ((), (b), (a, b))
) t3(x, a, b);
```

The correct result for both queries (also returned by Postgres) is:
```
x,a,b
1,1,1
1,1,1
1,1,1
2,0,0
```

However, for the first query, duckdb returns:
```
x,a,b
1,1,1
1,1,1
1,1,1
```

### To Reproduce

The queries require no database, thus DuckDB CLI can be used to reproduce.
I can also reproduce on DuckDB WASM.
