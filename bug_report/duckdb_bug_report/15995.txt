Title: Add run_all option to Python.yml (and InvokeCI.yml)
Description:
Short term goal is being able to build (and test) all relevant Python wheels on a random commit.

End goal is cleaning up logic from within the YAML files (is main? is tagged with a v?) to some external yet-to-be-implemented but available manually control workflow.
