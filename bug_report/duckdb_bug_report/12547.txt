Title: Branches of CASE statement reevaluate `random()` expression 
Description:
### What happens?

Follow up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/12546

Each WHEN branch of the CASE expression re-evaluates the original expression. If the original expression contains a `random()`, this leads to surprising results. Given that there are other stops from accidentally re-using expressions with side effects, I believe this constitutes a bug.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT count(*) / 10_000_000 FROM
(
SELECT 
case (trunc(random() * 4 + 1))::INTEGER
        when  1 then '0001'
        when  2 then '0010'
        when  3 then '0100'
        when  4 then '1000'
        else 'unknown'
      end as bits
from generate_series(1, 10_000_000) t(i)
)
GROUP BY bits
ORDER BY bits
;
```
```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│ (count_star() / 10000000) │
│          double           │
├───────────────────────────┤

```

These numbers should add up to 1!
