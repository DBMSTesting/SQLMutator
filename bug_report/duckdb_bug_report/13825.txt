Title: When vacuuming, immediately checkpoint the vacuumed row groups instead of scheduling a checkpoint task
Description:
This fixes an issue where if we are vacuuming many row groups, the system was first vacuuming everything into in-memory row groups, followed by checkpointing them later on. By directly executing the checkpoint we can checkpoint the row groups while they are still fresh in-memory, and we avoid having to keep them in-memory for an extended period of time.

This partially alleviates the need for the max_vacuum_tasks introduced in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13811 - although having a limit is likely still a good idea.
