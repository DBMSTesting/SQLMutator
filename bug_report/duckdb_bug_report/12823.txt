Title: [Dev] Clean up the `generate_serialization.py` script a bit
Description:
Just a couple changes I made a while ago:

- Added type hints, hopefully making the code easier to follow
- Replace `.replace(name, replacement)` with `.format(name=replacement)` to make it a little more structured.
- Used UPPER_CASE style for constants like formats, to differentiate between variables and constants
