Title: python: non-nullable dtypes become nullable when materialized to arrow
Description:
### What happens?

I searched for [similar issues](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+null+arrow), didn't find any.

See the repro step below, I think this is pretty self explanatory. I'm not sure if this is only present on the python bindings, or if it is present elsewhere too.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

sql = """
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t (a INTEGER NOT NULL);
    SELECT * FROM t;
"""
duckdb.sql(sql).arrow().schema
# expected `a: int64 not null`
# actual `a: int64`
```
