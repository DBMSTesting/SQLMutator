Title: Previously working unnesting JSON Sql script breaking in v1.1.x
Description:
### What happens?

Updated to 1.1.1 and previously working SQL scripting breaks in specific nested JSON use case.

### To Reproduce

Reading a nested JSON file with contents (simplified example):

```
{
   "MainLevel":[
      {
         "More":{
         }
      },
      {
         "More":{
            "Level2":[
               {
                  "Field1":"A"
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   ]
}

```
---------------
Using this SQL statement:

```
SELECT 
    Level2.Field1,
FROM 
    (SELECT unnest(MainLevel) as MainLevel
     FROM read_JSON_auto('*.json'))
     as MainLevel,
    unnest(MainLevel.More.Level2) as Level2;
```
	
----------------
Error (using dbeaver or CLI on Windows10):

```
SQL Error: java.sql.SQLException: Binder Error: Table "Level2" does not have a column named "Field1"
LINE 2:     Level2.Field1,
```

----------------

This script worked prior to updating beyond 1.0
**If this is new planned behavior, can someone explain how to fix this code example?**  I do need to pick out specific data elements and not read in whole file as there are thousands of elements.
