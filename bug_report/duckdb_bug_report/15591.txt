Title: [Compression] `Dictionary` compression data now also includes the validity data
Description:
This PR supersedes #15365 
It also makes #15404 obsolete

With the merging of #15566, the StandardColumnData will now scan only once to checkpoint base+validity together.
We can detect from the `final_analyze` call whether the method for the base data can include the validity information.
If that's the case, we replace the selected function for the validity with `COMPRESSION_EMPTY`

The compression function only checks whether the segment contains nulls and counts the amount of tuples.
Then in the `compress_finalize` call it creates a single empty segment.

The scan functions are no-ops, because it will always be scanned together with the base data, which will contain the validity information as well.

### Dictionary Compression

The dictionary compression is one such method that can encode the validity information together with the base data, and it can do this with no extra cost.
It turns out this requires no changes to the compression code, only the scan code has been altered.
This means that even previously created Dictionary compressed segments can take advantage of this optimization.
