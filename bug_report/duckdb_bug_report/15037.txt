Title: [PySpark] - Add broadcast function
Description:
This PR adds a broadcast function to maintain compatibility with the PySpark API in a DuckDB context.

The function simply returns the input DataFrame unchanged, as broadcasting is not applicable in DuckDB's single-node architecture.

This approach ensures API compliance but does not implement any actual optimizations.

I don't know if this is the best solution or if a warning should be added to clarify the no-op behavior.
