Title: Switch to shared pointer for multfilelists
Description:
Reasoning is that we want to be able to share the MultiFileLists between scans. MultiFileList can be expensive to create. (for example reading a delta table over the network)

In delta I am working on the concept of attach "single-table-catalogs" for delta tables. This would allow us to cache the MultiFileList in the DeltaCatalog or in the DeltaTransaction.
