Title: CatalogException: Catalog Error: Scalar Function with name date does not exist! Did you mean "age"?
Description:
### What happens?

Recently installed `duckdb` and trying to demo its usage but getting an error with a simple join.

This:
```
s = '''
select a.ticker, a.clean_pub_date, a.trade_id, a.wgt, b.Date, b.value
from trade_list a
left join cr_melt b
on a.ticker = b.variable
and b.Date between a.clean_pub_date and DATE(a.clean_pub_date, '+1 year')
and a.clean_pub_date >= '2020-12-01'

'''

newdf = duckdb.query(s)
```
Gives this error:
```
CatalogException: Catalog Error: Scalar Function with name date does not exist!
Did you mean "age"?
```

My query doesn't contain any reference to 'date' so not clear what it's communicating.  

Have tried a simple test case and it works without issue:
`newdf = duckdb.query('select * from trade_list where 1=1').df()`

Completes successfully and returns the contents of the `trade_list` df.  

Any guidance on what this error indicates.

### To Reproduce

```
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

s = '''
select a.ticker, a.clean_pub_date, a.trade_id, a.wgt, b.Date, b.value
from trade_list a
left join cr_melt b
on a.ticker = b.variable
and b.Date between a.clean_pub_date and DATE(a.clean_pub_date, '+1 year')
and a.clean_pub_date >= '2020-12-01'
'''

newdf = duckdb.query(s).df()
```
