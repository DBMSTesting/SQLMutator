Title: Respect limit during join order
Description:
while iterating through the relations, check to see if a limit is encountered. If so modify the estimated cardinality of the added relation accordingly. 

Right now this only includes the case where the limit val is constant, but this logic can most likely be expanded to include cases where it is a percentage as well. 

No attention is paid to the offset value. My thinking is that the limit value is what is important to the optimizer when choosing a build side and estimating the cardinality of a join. If someone thinks otherwise please let me know
