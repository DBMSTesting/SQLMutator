Title: Import database: Schema with name "information_schema" already exists
Description:
### What happens?

We are using DuckDB on the open-source software [Gladys Assistant](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys) since the 1.0 release, and so far we love using DuckDB :)

So first, thanks a lot for your work, it's an amazing software üôå

However, we are using the EXPORT/IMPORT feature to backup our DuckDB database, and we are running into an issue when importing the database.

### To Reproduce

We export the DB using this simple query:

```sql
EXPORT DATABASE ./my-db.duckdb (
          FORMAT PARQUET,
          COMPRESSION GZIP
      )
```

Then, I notice that the schema.sql file contains: 

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA information_schema;
CREATE SCHEMA pg_catalog;



CREATE TABLE t_device_feature_state(device_feature_id UUID, "value" DOUBLE, created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE);
```

When re-importing the dataset using: 

```sql
IMPORT DATABASE '/folder_path'
```

I'm getting an error: 

```
 [Error: Catalog Error: Schema with name "information_schema" already exists!] {
  errno: -1,
  code: 'DUCKDB_NODEJS_ERROR',
  errorType: 'Catalog'
}
```

I've looked into existing issues, and I found this one: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12776 that was supposed to be fixed in the 1.1 release.

I've tried upgrading to DuckDB v1.1.1, and I still get the same error when restoring this backup. Note that the backup was still done using DuckDB 1.0, we need to restore this existing backup.

Any idea what could be wrong?

Thanks a lot for your help, and thank you for building DuckDB ! üôè
