Title: NO_PARTITION_COLUMNS option to skip partition writes for Parquet copy
Description:
Fixes the issue of duplicate columns created for partitioned writes of Parquet files which is mentioned in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12147 and https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/11931

This PR provides `NO_PARTITION_COLUMNS` option into Copy-To, which skips the write of partition columns when specified.
