Title: struct: no support for UPDATE?
Description:
### What happens?

I was trying to update struct values, but couldn't find any documentation about it and also no way to make it work.

Using `struct_insert` inside an `UPDATE` statement to set the column fails with:
```
Mismatch Type Error: Type STRUCT(<field-spec-new>) does not match with STRUCT(<field-spec-old>). Cannot cast STRUCTs of different size
```
...if the struct previously had not defined the to-be-updated field, or with:
```
Binder Error: Duplicate struct entry name "<field>"
```

Trying to just set a specific field value fails as well with (same error, no matter whether the field already exists or not):
```
Conversion Error: Type <field-value-type> with value <new-value> can't be cast to the destination type STRUCT
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_add AS
SELECT { name: 'Alice', role: 'admin' } AS a;

UPDATE test_add SET a = struct_insert(a, auth_type := 'oidc');
UPDATE test_add SET a.auth_type = 'oidc';


CREATE TABLE test_set AS
SELECT { name: 'Alice', role: 'admin', auth_type: NULL::VARCHAR } AS a;

UPDATE test_set SET a = struct_insert(a, auth_type := 'oidc');
UPDATE test_set SET a.auth_type = 'oidc';
```
