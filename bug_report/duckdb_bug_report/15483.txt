Title: internal error with recursive SQL query
Description:
### What happens?

The attached SQL query (a solution for day 6 of this year's advent of code) triggers an internal error when executed in DuckDB. It can be executed successfully in Postgres 17.2.
The problem occurs both in the latest release and in in the current shell (https://shell.duckdb.org/).

### To Reproduce

```
with recursive aoc6_input(i) as (select '
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#..^.....
........#.
#.........
......#...
'),
lines(y,line) as (
   select 0, substr(i,1,position(E'\n' in i)-1), substr(i,position(E'\n' in i)+1)
   from aoc6_input
   union all
   select y+1,substr(r,1,position(E'\n' in r)-1), substr(r,position(E'\n' in r)+1)
   from lines l(y,l,r) where position(E'\n' in r)>0
),
rawfield(x,y,v) as (
   select x::smallint,y::smallint,substr(line,x::integer,1)
   from lines l, lateral generate_series(1,length(line)) g(x)
),
field(x,y,v) as (select x,y,case when v='^' then '.' else v end from rawfield),
startpos(x,y) as (select x,y from rawfield where v='^'),
bounds(maxx,maxy) as (select max(x) as maxx, max(y) as maxy from field),
directions(dd,dx,dy) as (values(0,0::smallint,-1::smallint),(1,1::smallint,0::smallint),(2,0::smallint,1::smallint),(3,-1::smallint,0::smallint)),
part1(px,py,pd) as (
   select x,y,0 from startpos
   union all
   select case when s then px+dx else px end, case when s then py+dy else py end, case when s then pd else (pd+1)%4 end
   from (select *, f.v is distinct from '#' as s
      from (part1 p join directions d on pd=dd) left join field f on f.x=px+dx and f.y=py+dy), bounds b
      where px>0 and py>0 and px<=maxx and py<=maxy
),
part1pos(vx,vy) as (select distinct px, py from part1, bounds where px>0 and py>0 and px<=maxx and py<=maxy),
candidates(vx,vy) as (select * from part1pos, startpos where vx<>x or vy<>y)
select (select count(*) from part1pos) as part1,
    (select count(*) from
     candidates where not exists (
     with recursive part2(px,py,pd) as (
        select x,y,0 from startpos
        union
        select case when s then px+dx else px end, case when s then py+dy else py end, case when s then pd else (pd+1)%4 end
        from (select *, (f.v is distinct from '#' and ((px+dx<>vx) or (py+dy<>vy))) as s
            from (part2 p join directions d on pd=dd) left join field f on f.x=px+dx and f.y=py+dy), bounds b
            where px>0 and py>0 and px<=maxx and py<=maxy
        )
    select * from part2, bounds where px<1 or py<1 or px>maxx or py>maxy
    )) as part2
