Title: strptime function fails with the error "strptime format must be a constant" when format parameter is not provided as a constant
Description:
### What happens?

The `strptime` function fails with the error "strptime format must be a constant" when the format parameter is not provided as a constant

**Working query:**

```sql
SELECT strptime('22.01.2024', '%d.%m.%Y');
```

**Failing query:**
```sql
WITH 
    pat AS (SELECT '%d.%m.%Y' AS value)
SELECT 
    strptime('22.01.2024', pat.value)
FROM
    pat;
```

This issue restricts the use of `strptime`. For instance, it is not possible to create a macro like this:
```sql
CREATE MACRO to_ts_value(ts_text_value, ts_patter) AS {'Value': {'TimestampUtc': strptime(ts_text_value, ts_patter)}}::json;
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
WITH 
    pat AS (SELECT '%d.%m.%Y' AS value)
SELECT 
    strptime('22.01.2024', pat.value)
FROM
    pat;
```
