Title: [Dev] Remove problematic use of `condition_variable`
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2575

Due to a likely bug in gcc, the use of `condition_variable` can result in a "suspected double lock" warning by the ThreadSanitizer.

We replace it with the `moodycamel::LightweightSemaphore` that we also use in the TaskScheduler.
