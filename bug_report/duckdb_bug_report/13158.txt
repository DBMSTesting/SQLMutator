Title: Add clang-tidy-diff script, and invoke it on PRs
Description:
Script has been sourced from LLVM repository: https://clang.llvm.org/extra/doxygen/clang-tidy-diff_8py_source.html

This allows clang-tidy CI check on PRs to go from 40 minutes to a few minutes (proportional to how many files are modified).

To be considered separately: widening the checks performed by clang-tidy-diff with respect to clang-tidy. Say we want to add a given set of checks, having modified files having more restrictive checks is a soft way of driving change in adoption (since whoever touches a file will be bound by more strict rules that the one in place for the older part of the codebase, and allows change to be gradual).
