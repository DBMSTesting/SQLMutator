Title: DuckDB C interface cannot correctly obtain the UUID result
Description:
### What happens?

In the duckdb.h provided by DuckDB, you can see that the UUID type is actually stored using duckdb_hugeint. However, when I tried to retrieve the content corresponding to the UUID using duckdb_value_hugeint, I encountered some issues with the internal implementation.

In DuckDB, when C is used, GetInternalCValue is employed, and its internal implementation does not account for scenarios where the type obtained is a UUID. As a result, it resorts to fetching the default value, ultimately leading to the return of an all-zero value.

It seems that a fix could be implemented by referencing the GetValuesInternal method.
