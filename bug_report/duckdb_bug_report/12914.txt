Title: Fixes for duckdb_constraints and information_schema constraint tables
Description:
Fix #12863
Fix #12867
Fix #12868
Fix #12838

This PR fixes several issues with listing constraints:

* Generate consistent and unique constraint names directly in `duckdb_constraints`
* No longer rely on bound constraints in `duckdb_constraints`, allowing this to work for all attached databases
* Emit foreign key references directly in `duckdb_constraints`, and use that instead of a regex to generate `information_schema.referential_constraints`
* Correctly deal with case insensitivity in the queries
* Correctly list the catalog name of the constraints
