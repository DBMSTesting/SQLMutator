Title: IO Error: No space left on device
Description:
### What happens?

I was partitioning a csv file into 10000+ partitions using python API. After hours of run, it raised error: `duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Cannot open file "../XXX.parquet": No space left on device`.

I checked with myself and contact with technique guys and we both confirmed that my account on the HPC still has a large storage space, which should be enough to run this job.



### To Reproduce

```py
# %%
import numpy as np
import duckdb
import pandas as pd
import glob

# configuration
duckdb.sql("SET threads TO 10")
duckdb.sql("SET memory_limit = '50GB'")
duckdb.sql("SET temp_directory = '/home/yc85/scratch/XXX'") # scratch is a soft link from /scratch/users/XXX

duckdb.sql("select current_setting('threads')")
duckdb.sql("select current_setting('memory_limit')")
duckdb.sql("select current_setting('temp_directory')")

query = """
COPY (
    SELECT 
        "A", "B", "C"
    FROM 
        read_csv('../../XXX.txt', delim = '\t', header = true)
) TO '../../prepartitioned_XXX_data/' 
    (FORMAT PARQUET, PARTITION_BY "B", OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE);
"""
duckdb.sql(query)

```
