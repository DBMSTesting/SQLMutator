Title: [C-API] duckdb_result_return_type definition
Description:
### What happens?

`duckdb_result_return_type` C-API is defined as deprected C-API in the future in duckdb.h after #12682 merged.
Is this intended change?

### To Reproduce

```c
#define DUCKDB_API_NO_DEPRECATED 1
#include <duckdb.h>

int main() {
    duckdb_result res;
    duckdb_result_return_type(res);
    return 0;
}
```

I got the following error when compiling the above code.
```
$ clang -Iwork/duckdb/src/include/ a.c
a.c:6:5: error: call to undeclared function 'duckdb_result_return_type'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
