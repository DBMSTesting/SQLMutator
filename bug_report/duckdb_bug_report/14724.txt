Title: Removing upload-artifact@v3
Description:
GH Actions has deprecated the `upload-artifact@v3` action and emailed me that they will be **failing** starting December 5. This PR updates them to the next version, v4. The only [Breaking Change](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact?tab=readme-ov-file#breaking-changes) that could possibly affect us is that "it is no longer possible to upload to the same named Artifact multiple times". I checked but we do not seem to be doing that. 

One possible issue is releases of the 1.1.x branch after December 5, those will likely fail without an update.
