Title: Unable to open a database if wal file has same primary key delete + insert
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB recently added support for doing delete + insert on the same primary key in a single transaction as part of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15092. Thanks a lot @taniabogatsch for the same.

Looks like there is an edge case we need to solve.
If a delete + insert on the same primary key exists in the wal file. Then we cannot open the database itself


### To Reproduce

```
.tmp/22-jan $ ./duckdb primary_key_issue.db
v1.1.4-dev4815 8e68a3e34a
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
```
```sql
create table abcd (id int primary key);
insert into abcd values (1);
begin;
delete from abcd where id = 1;
insert into abcd values (1);
commit;
````
```console
zsh: killed     ./duckdb primary_key_issue.db
```

After `commit` above, kill the duckdb process via a different terminal
This will make the above operations not checkpointed
```
.tmp/22-jan $ ./duckdb primary_key_issue.db
Error: unable to open database "primary_key_issue.db": Constraint Error: Failure while replaying WAL file "primary_key_issue.db.wal": Duplicate key "id: 1" violates primary key constraint.
```
