Title: improper exception message when connecting to a database file in an non-existing folder
Description:
### What happens?

``` python
conn = duckdb.connect(r"d:\no-this-folder\data.db")
```

output:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "d:\src\test.py", line 17, in <module>
    conn = duckdb.connect(r"d:\no-this-folder\data.db")
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xd5 in position 60: invalid continuation byte
```

When the parent folder `d:\no-this-folder` is created manually, it works fine.
So it's not the `UnicodeDecodeError`, but something like `IOError`

### To Reproduce

connect to a database in a not-existed folder:

``` python
conn = duckdb.connect(r"d:\no-this-folder\data.db")
```
