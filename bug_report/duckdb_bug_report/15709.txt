Title: Preserve stack trace information when re-throwing
Description:
When executing a query like:
```cpp
con.Query("CALL throw_exception()");
```
the resulting error message includes a stack trace because `throw_exception()` raises an internal exception.

However, the stack trace will NOT point to the table function as the origin of the error. This happens because the exception will be re-thrown in https://github.com/motherduckdb/public-duckdb/blob/7ab5640bb3b03c777bc2c69a8943a37f773f4cb2/src/include/duckdb/execution/task_error_manager.hpp#L44, thereby overwriting the original stack trace.

This PR preserves the original stack trace in case `ErrorData` is copied.
