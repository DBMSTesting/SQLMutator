Title: add attach with default tables
Description:
This PR adds the concept of default tables to Catalogs.

What this allows is scanning the default table of a catalog by the catalog name:

```SQL
attach 'test.db' as attached_database (default_table 'my_table');
SELECT * FROM attached_database;
```

This is useful for delta, where we primarily want to be ableto attach single tables for writing at some point. However this will also allow other useful things like improving performance by sharing delta snapshots between scans, and providing ACID guarantees when scanning delta tables.
