Title: Unable to read pd.DataFrame() variable by calling the custom packaged duckdb function from another script
Description:
### What happens?

When calling a custom packaged duckdb function from another script, it is unable to read the current environment pd.DataFrame() variable. However, this worked fine in past versions, such as 1.0.0.

### To Reproduce

``` 
# func.py
def duck(sql, cores=1):
    import duckdb
    duckdb.execute(f"PRAGMA threads={cores};")
    return duckdb.sql(sql).df()
```

``` 
# test.py
import func
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(list(range(1,10)),columns=['a'])
func.duck("from df")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CatalogException: Catalog Error: Table with name df does not exist!
Did you mean "pg_depend"?
```
