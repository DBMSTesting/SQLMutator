Title: [Dev] Add `query` to QueryRelation for logging
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2537

I've tried to be as unintrusive as possible here so R and other clients that rely on the Relation API are unaffected.
SelectStatement should support `ToString` in all scenarios.

This PR should add minimal overhead to the construction of a QueryRelation, the `query` string is forwarded to `RelationStatement` which makes it available to the ActiveQueryContext
