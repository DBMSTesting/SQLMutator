Title: Fix LinuxRelease.yml CI by avoiding upload
Description:
This will need to reworked when we have a better solution for manylinux & other containerized CI runs, but at least allowing more testing AND avoiding failure just on upload should be better.

Also skipping 2 follow up jobs, given they can't be completed (at the moment) due to requirement on node 20.
