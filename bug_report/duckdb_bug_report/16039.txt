Title: Replace `FormatException` with `InvalidInputException` in Parquet reader
Description:
In the Parquet reader, there is one place where a `FormatException` is thrown when the Parquet file is malformed, while in all other cases an `InvalidInputException` is used. At MotherDuck, we try to distinguish DuckDB errors that indicate serious issues and errors that are caused by external triggers (like a malformed Parquet file). For this, it would be helpful to use a consistent error type for similar errors.

This PR therefore replaces the `FormatException` with an `InvalidInputException`.

This also gives a slightly nicer error message because a `FormatException` leads the error message to be prefixed with "Invalid Error".
