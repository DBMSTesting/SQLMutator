Title: Fetching data from AWS S3 fails with 400 status
Description:
### What happens?

From the local machine, I tried to connect S3 buckets; but it failed with 400 error. I tried multiple ways of setting SECRET including a statistic access token and secret, but none worked.

```
D CREATE SECRET secret1 (
      TYPE S3,
      PROVIDER CREDENTIAL_CHAIN
  );
D CREATE SECRET secret2 (
      TYPE S3,
      KEY_ID 'xxxx',
      SECRET 'xxxx',
      REGION 'ap-northeast-1'
  );
D CREATE SECRET secret3 (
      TYPE S3,
      PROVIDER CREDENTIAL_CHAIN,
      PROFILE 'PROFILE',
      ENDPOINT 's3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com'
  );

D SELECT * FROM read_json('s3://dev-jsir-logs/AWSLogs/xxxxxxxxxxxx/CloudFront/xxxxxx/2025/01/31/04/logs/xxxxxx.2025-01-31-04.64d0665b.gz');
HTTP Error: HTTP GET error on 'https://dev-jsir-logs.s3.amazonaws.com/AWSLogs/xxxxxx/CloudFront/xxxxxx/2025/01/31/04/logs/xxxx.2025-01-31-04.64d0665b.gz' (HTTP 400)
````

### To Reproduce

      TYPE S3,
      PROVIDER CREDENTIAL_CHAIN
  );
# and various methods

D SELECT * FROM read_json('s3://dev-jsir-logs/AWSLogs/xxxxxxxxxxxx/CloudFront/xxxxxx/2025/01/31/04/logs/xxxxxx.2025-01-31-04.64d0665b.gz');
