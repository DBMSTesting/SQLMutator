Title: Add `-safe` mode to shell which disables external access, and remove SQLite UDFs from the shell
Description:
This PR adds the `-safe` parameter to the shell. When the CLI is launched with this parameter, the CLI is prevented from accessing external files other than the database file that it was initially connected to and prevented from interacting with the host file system. This has the following effects:

* `.cd`, `.excel`, `.log`, `.import`, `.open`, `.output`, `.once`, `.read`, `.sh` and `.system` are disabled
* Auto-complete no longer scans the file system for files to suggest as auto-complete targets
* The shell-only function `getenv` is disabled
* `enable_external_access` is set to `false`, which in turn disables commands like `ATTACH` of an on-disk file, `COPY ...` to read to/write from files


#### SQLite UDFs

In a continuous effort to clean-up the shell this PR also removes support for several (undocumented) SQLite UDFs that were provided only in the shell:

* `edit`, `writefile`, `readfile`, `lsmode` and `sha3`
