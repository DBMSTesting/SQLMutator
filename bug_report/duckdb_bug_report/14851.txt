Title: [Python][Dev] Skip `test_pandas_selection` on Python3.8
Description:
This PR fixes the nightly failure <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/11847998662/job/33019578870>

It first failed in the Series construction, but even when I made that pass it failed on the result checking as Pandas seems to turn the dtype into `object` for Int32Dtype series in this pandas version (2.0.3)
