Title: [CSV] comment='#' produces `INTERNAL Error`
Description:
### What happens?

With v1.1.3-dev119, the comment='#' produces:

```console
INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL!
```

when read_csv() is given the following two lines as per the program below:

```csv
a,b
a#b
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
select version();
create or replace table t as
from read_csv('comment.csv',
    header=false,
    sep=',',
    comment='#', -- breaks this file when a#b is encountered
    ignore_errors=true
  );
```
