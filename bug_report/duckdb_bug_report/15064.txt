Title: CLI: Add .safe_mode as a dot command as well
Description:
See https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14509, but as a dot command:

```sql
.safe_mode
ATTACH 'external_db.db';
-- Permission Error:
-- Cannot access file "external_db.db" - file system operations are disabled by configuration
```

This is useful because it allows us to do some initial setup (if desired) before enabling safe mode:

```sql
ATTACH 'permitted_db.db';
.safe_mode
-- we cannot attach new databases, but we can access permitted_db
```
