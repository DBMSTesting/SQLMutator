Title: Some clang tidy fixes around narrowing casts
Description:
Various fixes around [cppcoreguidelines-narrowing-conversions](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines/narrowing-conversions.html#cppcoreguidelines-narrowing-conversions).

One question is how we want to handle [u]int64_t to double casts, if via a UnsafeNumericCast / NumericCast, that looks the most appropriate, but needs to be implemented since currently those functions might not compile correctly for the unsigned case.

Connected to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13101, that led me to take a deeper look.
There is still some fixes needed that could lead to then enable the `cppcoreguidelines-narrowing-conversions` check.
