Title: Foreign keys using user defined types fail to be defined
Description:
### What happens?

If one uses `create type ...` to define a custom type, and then uses that as a primary key in some table, and it then references it as a foreign key, DuckDB (v1.1.3) fails with `Failed to create foreign key: incompatible types between column [...]`.

(It seems to be related to issue #9234, which was however closed due to "inactivity".)


### To Reproduce

Running the following simple SQL defining schema:

```sql
create type idtype as integer;

create table parent (id idtype primary key);
create table child (parent idtype references parent);
```

Fails with:

```console
Binder Error: Failed to create foreign key: incompatible types between column "id" ("INTEGER") and column "parent" ("idtype")
```
