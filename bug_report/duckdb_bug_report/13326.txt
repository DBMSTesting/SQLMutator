Title: Prevent the query thread from picking up query unrelated tasks if compiled with DUCKDB_NO_THREADS
Description:
Currently, DuckDB does not care which query a certain task belongs to, even if a producer token is passed to the `ConcurrentQueue::DequeueFromProducer` function in WASM.

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/64dc7845a95fb8013ca2c2e1d5ae84116e9788f0/src/parallel/task_scheduler.cpp#L89-L90

This introduces some difficulties when it comes to more granular control over the execution of queries in single-threaded environments. 


This pull request changes the way tasks are returned by the `ConcurrentQueue::DequeueFromProducer` function. It now also takes the ProducerToken into account and thereby only returns tasks associated with the passed producer token and, in extension, the query the token belongs to.
