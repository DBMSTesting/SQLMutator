Title: Use Arrow extension GetType() implementation when converting Arrow arrays
Description:
A possible fix to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15285#discussion_r1921637000 

I think the problem is that the `GetType()` implementation provided when registering the extension was never called. I am not sure this is the fix you all want to go with, but the current conversion (for extensions) I think will fail in some pretty common cases (e.g., https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-spatial/pull/485 ).
