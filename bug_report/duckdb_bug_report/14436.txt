Title: Prefix Aliases in SQL
Description:
This PR expands the accepted SQL of DuckDB once again to add support for Aliases before `SELECT` and `FROM` expressions. Often, having the alias first increases readability.  We use the colon `:` to separate aliases from expressions. For example, the following query

```SQL
SELECT 
  some_long_and_winding expression AS e1,
  a_shorter_expression AS e2
FROM
  long_schema.some_long_table_name AS t1,
  some_schema.some_table AS t2
```

can now be written like so:

```SQL
SELECT 
  e1: some_long_and_winding expression,
  e2: a_shorter_expression 
FROM
  t1: long_schema.some_long_table_name,
  t2: some_schema.some_table
```

Aliases can be quoted if necessary, only double quotes are supported.
```SQL
SELECT "my alias with spaces": 42
```

Prefix aliases also name expressions, function calls, subqueries, etc. e.g.:
```SQL
SELECT 
  e: 1 + 2, 
  f: len('asdf'), 
  s: (SELECT 42);
```

This also works in the `FROM` clause, even if the example is somewhat nonsensical:
```SQL
FROM
  r: range(10),
  v: (VALUES(42)),
  s: (FROM range(10))

```

One restriction is that due to parser limited lookahead (to be fixed eventually), there can not be column renames in prefix aliases in the `FROM` clause, so this does *NOT* work

```SQL
FROM r1(r2) : range(10);
```
