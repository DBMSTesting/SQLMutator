Title: Fix a binder issue with type aliases and foreign key constraints
Description:
This PR fixes #15428 

Constraints were bound before types were, making us compare the resolved type of the referenced table.column against the user type of our to-be-created table.

Now types are bound before binding the constraints, so the comparison is done on the resolved types.

### Misc

Looked at the `test/sql/collate/test_unsupported_collations.test` test because I noticed that collations are checked before the type is bound, but this ended up being fine as type aliases can't be created with collations anyway, i.e this fails:
```sql
create type my_alias as varchar collate nocase;
```
