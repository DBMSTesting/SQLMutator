Title: Do not depend on manylinux extension in Python's CI
Description:
Avoid publishing Python wheels for now, given they are not functional on Linux

Similar to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12891, where we avoid CI that we know will fail.

This requires a bigger rework connected to manylinux / containerized builds, but that should not block regular testing of PRs.
