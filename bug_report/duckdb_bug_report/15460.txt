Title: Retain join partition order
Description:
Follow-up of #15389, which improved partition selection by choosing small partitions first.

An oversight of that PR was that completely relying on sizes to select partitions will shuffle the partition order even if there are tiny differences which we wouldn't really care about. This PR rounds the partition sizes down to a multiple of the smallest partition size before sorting and using a stable sort. This way, tiny differences in partition sizes don't affect the sort order, and we will retain the original order as much as possible.

I've added a benchmark file, but was not able to see a significant difference with and without the change. However, counted I/O calls and saw that read/writes were reduced by around 5%, so this should help more on machines with slower disks.
