Creating a view with prepared parameters fails, while creating a table the same way works

with open('test.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(('a', 'b'))
    writer.writerow((1, 2))

with duckdb.connect() as con:
    # Works ok
    con.execute('CREATE TABLE "test1" AS SELECT * FROM read_csv(?)', ['test.csv'])
    # Fails
    con.execute('CREATE VIEW "test2" AS SELECT * FROM read_csv(?)', ['test.csv'])
```

Creating the view fails with
