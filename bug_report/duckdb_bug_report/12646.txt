Title: current_timestamp cannot be used in having clause (Binder Error) 
Description:
### What happens?

in 0.10.X+ (tried 1.0.0 as well) it appears as though current_timestamp cannot be used in a having clause anymore. 

A BinderError is thrown when I try. 

in 0.10.2 (cli)
```
v0.10.2 1601d94f94
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D select 1 as one, max(cast('2024-06-21 12:00:00' as timestamp)) as mt group by one having mt <= current_timestamp;
Binder Error: column current_timestamp must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
```

in 1.0.0
```
v1.0.0 1f98600c2c
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D select 1 as one, max(cast('2024-06-21 12:00:00' as timestamp)) as mt group by one having mt <= current_timestamp;
Binder Error: column current_timestamp must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
```

In 0.9.2 this still works
```
❯ duckdb
v0.9.2 3c695d7ba9
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D select 1 as one, max(cast('2024-06-21 12:00:00' as timestamp)) as mt group by one having mt <= current_timestamp;
┌───────┬─────────────────────┐
│  one  │         mt          │
│ int32 │      timestamp      │
├───────┼─────────────────────┤
│     1 │ 2024-06-21 12:00:00 │
└───────┴─────────────────────┘
```

It appears as though get_current_timestamp() is a workaround. 

Notably these queries also work in postgres (but can't use the alias 😭 )
```sql
select 
  1 as one, 
  max(cast('2024-05-01 00:00:00' as timestamp)) as mt 
group by one 
having max(cast('2024-05-01 00:00:00' as timestamp))  <= current_timestamp;
```

### To Reproduce

Simple SQL Query:

```sql
select 
  1 as one, 
  max(cast('2024-05-01 00:00:00' as timestamp)) as mt 
group by one 
having mt <= current_timestamp;
```
