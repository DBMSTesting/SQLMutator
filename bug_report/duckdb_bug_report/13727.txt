Title: Change test results so that they would pass also with 0.01% of tollerance
Description:
Current default is 1%, that might be too wide.

Connected to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13722 and the discussion at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13655

I haven't checked all tests / all configurations, and changing the tollerance for matching of floating point numbers is currently in core, so doesn't look right changing that code right now, but possibly it should be made configurable (and default to very small, then test that require more precision can change it).

This should basically keep working in current setup, but change tests to more closely reflect the actual floating point output.
