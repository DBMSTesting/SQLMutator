Title: GROUP BY ALL includes window functions, causing binder error
Description:
### What happens?

When using GROUP BY ALL, DuckDB incorrectly includes columns with window functions in the GROUP BY clause. This leads to a Binder Error: Cannot group on a window clause.

### To Reproduce

1. Create a sample table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample_data AS SELECT * FROM (
    VALUES (1, 'A', 100),
           (2, 'B', 200),
           (3, 'A', 300),
           (4, 'B', 400)
) AS t(id, category, value);
```

2. Run a query with GROUP BY ALL and a window function:

```sql
SELECT category,
       value,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category) AS row_num
FROM sample_data
GROUP BY ALL;
```

**Expected Behavior:** GROUP BY ALL should exclude columns with window functions (`row_num` here) from the GROUP BY clause.

**Actual Behavior:** The query fails with a Binder Error: Cannot group on a window clause.
