Title: Linux CLI: override platform for ARM manylinux
Description:
Currently we don't distribute extensions for `linux_arm64_gcc4` flavor, so I think it make little sense to distribute a CLI binary that can't load them.

This is not super clean, since then there might be cases where CLI can be launched but extensions load will fail due to a LIBC version mismatch, but I think that's somehow better that no extensions for all.

This needs to be reviewed going into v1.3, I will add it as task.
