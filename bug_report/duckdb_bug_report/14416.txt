Title: [Dev] Optimize `ValidityMask` when reading from a `ColumnDataCollection`
Description:
When we serialize the ColumnDataCollection, we will write the `validity_t *validity_mask` regardless of the validity being uninitialized or not.
We do this because it's difficult to keep track of the validity status when appending multiple Vectors.

When we read this back however, we receive a ValidityMask that returns false for `AllValid` which could be costly as most execution paths of the engine have optimized paths for `AllValid()` being true.

Now we'll efficiently check the validity mask when reading and replace it will nullptr if all entries are valid, enabling the `AllValid() == true` optimized path for these vectors.
