Title: Persistent HTTP secrets work only one time, cause `INTERNAL Error: ExtraValueInfo type mismatch` on 2nd usage.
Description:
### What happens?

When creating a persistent HTTP secret on either an in-memory or a file persistent database, the secret will cause any HTTP interaction within it's scope to fail with `INTERNAL Error: ExtraValueInfo type mismatch`

### To Reproduce

Example from motherduck.com, added persistent, first call works

```bash
duckdb -c "
CREATE PERSISTENT SECRET http (
    TYPE HTTP,
    EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS MAP {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_test_VePHdqKTYQjKNInc7u56JBrQ'
    }
);
select unnest(data) as customers 
from read_json('https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers')"
```

Rerun (duckdb must be restarted)

```bash
duckdb -c "select unnest(data) as customers 
from read_json('https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers')"
```

Result:

```
INTERNAL Error: ExtraValueInfo type mismatch
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
