Title: Avoid adding a suffix to Parquet files when doing a partitioned write
Description:
Follow-up fix from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11903

We should not add the `.gz` or `.zst` extensions to Parquet files as the compression is done internally. Instead, we move the suffix adding logic to the CSV writer itself.
