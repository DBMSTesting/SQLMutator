Title: CIBW_SKIP also musllinux on Python 3.7 or Python 3.8
Description:
3.8 is end of live, 3.8 close to. This is due to problem connected to https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12016 and https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/3329#issuecomment-1201663383.

Tracked this with @Tishj. Users might still manage to build locally, but we can't reliably build those wheels in CI given requirement on distutils.msvccompiler (on Linux..)
