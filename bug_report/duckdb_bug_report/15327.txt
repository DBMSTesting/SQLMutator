Title: Cannot reference schema scoped type as list type
Description:
### What happens?

This is an issue similar to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13981, but impacts the usage of custom types as list types inside of a schema.

### To Reproduce

This works:

```sql
create type MyItem as struct(
    name text
);

create type MyList as struct(
    items MyItem[]
);
```

But it doesn't work when the types live inside of a schema:

```sql
create schema foo;

create type foo.MyItem as struct(
    name text
);

create type foo.MyList as struct(
    items foo.MyItem[]
);
```

The error I get is:

```sql
Parser Error: syntax error at or near "["
LINE 2:     items foo.MyItem[]
```
