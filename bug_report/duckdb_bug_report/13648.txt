Title: Fix secret test failure
Description:
The persistent secret directory used in tests should be unique, convention is now just the name of the test which makes it easy to find the right test in the tmp test dir when debugging.

Perhaps we could look into doing this automatically later, to reduce chance of copy errors like this, but that could also be confusing
