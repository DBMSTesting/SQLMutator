Title: Cannot specify the name of the filename column using the filename argument
Description:
### What happens?

In document, since v0.10.2, there is a feature to specify the name of the filename column using the filename argument:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv(['flights1.csv', 'flights2.csv'], union_by_name = true, filename = "my_filename_column");
```

However when I try this feature, I got the following error:

```console
Invalid Input Error: Failed to cast value: Could not convert string 'original_filename' to BOOL
```

### To Reproduce

Have a test.csv with filename column

```
filename, content
abc.csv, hello
```

Try this query:

```sql
select * from read_csv('test.csv', filename="original_filename");
```

```console
Invalid Input Error: Failed to cast value: Could not convert string 'my_filename_column' to BOOL
```
