Title: Query run even though subquery has an error
Description:
### What happens?

SQL query runs even though one of the subqueries is invalid.  For example, when I run this against Redshift it correctly reports an error.

But DuckDb actually executes the entire query (but does not limit the rows due to the subquery).

What's interesting is that if I just run the subquery on its own, DuckDb flags the error.
