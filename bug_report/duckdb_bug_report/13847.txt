Title: Boolean implicitly cast to integer in list literal
Description:
### What happens?

```sql
SELECT [0, true]
```
works and creates `[0, 1]` but should fail according to the casting matrix in the documentation.

Probably related to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11958 but creating new issue since that one has been open for a while and maybe the list behavior is considered more severe.
