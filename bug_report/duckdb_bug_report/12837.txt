Title: `SET home_directory` doesn't do anything 
Description:
### What happens?

Setting the `home_directory` config when no `HOME` env variable is set doesn't do anything.

### To Reproduce

Using the duckDB CLI on macOS:

1. Unset the HOME env var
```bash
unset HOME
```

2. Start the DuckDB CLI and try querying an S3 Parquet file. (The following Parquet file is public and should work).
```sql
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://paradedb-benchmarks/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet') LIMIT 1;
```
```
Extension Autoloading Error: An error occurred while trying to automatically install the required extension 'httpfs':
Can't find the home directory at ''
Specify a home directory using the SET home_directory='/path/to/dir' option.
```

3. Try setting `home_directory` and run the same command, you'll get the same error.
```sql
SET home_directory = '/tmp';
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://paradedb-benchmarks/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet') limit 1;
```
```
Extension Autoloading Error: An error occurred while trying to automatically install the required extension 'httpfs':
Can't find the home directory at ''
Specify a home directory using the SET home_directory='/path/to/dir' option.
```
