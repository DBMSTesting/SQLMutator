Title: Conversion Error: Malformed JSON
Description:
### What happens?

When trying to de an operation on JSON fields, strange error appears.
This works fine:

However doing operations on both fields fail:

The only way to overcome this is to explicitely cast field to STRING.

In fact the field returned is JSON type, even if we take the value of the json object retrieved by the path, (that should be string).

```sql
SELECT data.data.stuff FROM dataframe
```
should have a return type of the same type of 'data.data.stuff' not JSON by default
