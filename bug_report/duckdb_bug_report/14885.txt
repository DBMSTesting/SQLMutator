Title: Strange macro results
Description:
### What happens?

I have this macro to calculate year quarter:

```sql
create or replace macro yearqtr(x) as 
(SELECT (((date_part('year', CAST(x AS DATE)) * 10) + ((date_part('month', CAST(x AS DATE)) - 1) // 3)) + 1));
```

Now, when i try to use this i get some very weird results for a particular date. Here's the query in question:

```sql
with df as (select unnest(generate_series('2000-01-01'::date,'2099-12-31'::date,interval 1 day)::date[]) as dt) 
select dt,yearqtr(dt) as yq,yearqtr('2025-12-31') as yq1,yearqtr(dt)//10 as yq2,yearqtr(dt)//3 as yq3,yearqtr(dt)%3 as yq4 from df where dt='2050-12-31';
```

What is evey weirder is that if you run this query a few times i get different values for `yq`, `yq2`, `yq3`! I suspect that this has got something to do with the `//` operator.

I'm unsure if this strangeness is only for the date '2050-12-31' or i was unlucky enough to stumble upon this edge case.

### To Reproduce

```sql
create or replace macro yearqtr(x) as 
(SELECT (((date_part('year', CAST(x AS DATE)) * 10) + ((date_part('month', CAST(x AS DATE)) - 1) // 3)) + 1));
```

Now run the following query a few times:

```sql
with df as (select unnest(generate_series('2000-01-01'::date,'2099-12-31'::date,interval 1 day)::date[]) as dt) 
select dt,yearqtr(dt) as yq,yearqtr('2025-12-31') as yq1,yearqtr(dt)//10 as yq2,yearqtr(dt)//3 as yq3,yearqtr(dt)%3 as yq4 from df where dt='2050-12-31';
```
