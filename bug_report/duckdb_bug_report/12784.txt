Title: Discrepancy in Handling Interval Operations Between PostgreSQL and DuckDB
Description:
### What happens?

There appears to be a discrepancy in the results of interval arithmetic between PostgreSQL and DuckDB. When subtracting a complex interval from a timestamp, PostgreSQL and DuckDB yield different results. 


### To Reproduce

the query 
```sql
select ('1920-12-12 01:02:02+05:30'::timestamptz + interval '-1 month 400 day 6000 minute 121 hour 12 second')::timestamptz as r;
```
in Postgres returns
```
             r             
---------------------------
 1921-12-26 06:02:14+05:30
(1 row)


```
and in duckdb returns:
```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│             r             │
│ timestamp with time zone  │
├───────────────────────────┤
│ 1921-12-25 06:02:14+05:30 │
└───────────────────────────┘

```
