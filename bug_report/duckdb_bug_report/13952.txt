Title: Duplicated literal column names should throw errors
Description:
### What happens?

Query aliases, e.g. `FROM (...) AS tbl(a, A)`, and direct column aliases, e.g. `SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS A` unnecessarily allow duplicate column names, which are auto-deduplicated as soon as they're actually being used.

I'm against allowing duplicate column names in general (and have asked for an option to opt out at 
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11520) but the issue here is more specific and needs fixing even for those that do like the status quo:

Allowing duplicated column names in an explicit list of literal column names cannot ever be useful and can cause a lot of confusion. 

### To Reproduce


```sql
SELECT A + 1 AS B FROM (SELECT 1, 2) _(a, A);
```

```
┌───────┐
│   B   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     2 │
└───────┘
(why is this not 3, the novice asks)
```


```sql
SELECT A + 1 AS B FROM (SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS A)
```

```
┌───────┐
│   B   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     2 │
└───────┘
(why is this not 3, the novice asks)
```
