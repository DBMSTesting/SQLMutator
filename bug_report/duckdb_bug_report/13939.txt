Title: Schema resolution for custom types broken
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB 1.1.0 SQL finds a custom type which does not exist in the given database schema.

### To Reproduce

Using the DuckDB CLI run

```sql
create schema myschema;
create type myschema.mytype as struct(i int);
create table myschema.mytable(v mytype);
```

Actual: Executes without an error; this is unexpected.

Expected: In `(v mytype);` the reference to `mytype` is flagged as not existing, i.e. an error
```
Catalog Error: Type with name mytype does not exist!
Did you mean "myschema.mytype"?
```
The _error_ is expected because the `create table` (implicitly) refers to the `main` schema, where `mytype` does not exist.
