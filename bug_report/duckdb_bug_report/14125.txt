Title: Issue found SQL on Pandas
Description:
Dear duckDB team,

I used to deal with duckdb 1.0.0. With this version, using a dataframe as a table is easy, and within a function. However, using version 1.1.1, it dos not work anymore. Let me explain:
```python

# Construct dataframe
mydf = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3]})

# Query dataframe - OK for both versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.1
duckdb.query("SELECT sum(a) FROM mydf").to_df())

# Query dataframe using a function - OK with 1.0.0 - KO with version 1.1.1 !!!
self.query(query="SELECT sum(a) FROM mydf"))

Traceback (most recent call last):
...
duckdb.duckdb.CatalogException: Catalog Error: Table with name mydf does not exist!
```

Does it mean that a dataframe is not shared with a 'sub-function' anymore?
