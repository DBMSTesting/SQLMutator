Title: Fix Cross Product Cardinality
Description:
Setting cross-product cardinality in the constructor strangely introduces a new filter operator in the query plan (with cardinality 0). Subsequent operators will adopt 0 as their cardinality, which is incorrect. 

Instead, only set the cardinality "safely" inside the query graph manager

This (partially) reverts [PR](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13818).
