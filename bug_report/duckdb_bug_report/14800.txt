Title: Implement #14787: allow expressions in the aggregate clause of a PIVOT statement, as long as the aggregate clause only modifies the aggregate result and does not contain other columns
Description:
Implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14481
Implements #14787

The following is now allowed:

```sql
PIVOT Cities ON Country USING COALESCE(SUM(Population), 0) GROUP BY Year;
PIVOT Cities ON Country USING SUM(Population)::INT64 GROUP BY Year;
```

Note that every method in the `USING` clause must contain **exactly** one aggregate, and column references can only be used inside the aggregate, e.g. the following are not allowed:

```sql
-- ERROR: multiple aggregates
PIVOT Cities ON Country USINGSUM(Population) * COUNT(*) GROUP BY Year;
-- ERROR: using a column outside of the aggregate function
PIVOT Cities ON Country USING SUM(Population) + OtherColumn GROUP BY Year;
```
