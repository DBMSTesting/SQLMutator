Title: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fails with an existing VIEW
Description:
### What happens?

When a VIEW exists, and DROP TABLE IF EXISTS is applied on the name of that VIEW, an `duckdb.duckdb.CatalogException: Catalog Error: Existing object ServiceJourneyPattern is of type View, trying to replace with type Table` is presented. I would expect that the "IF EXISTS" would take care of the situation that the table does not exist.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (i integer);
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS v1;
```

### OS:

Linux

### DuckDB Version:

v1.0.1-dev2361 9eb0e58a02

### DuckDB Client:
