Title: `* RENAME (...) LIKE ...` is broken
Description:
### What happens?

The combination of `RENAME` and `LIKE` in a star expression currently ignores the `RENAME`.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT * RENAME (number2 as test) LIKE '%number%'
FROM (SELECT 1 AS number1, 2 AS number2)
```
```
┌─────────┬─────────┐
│ number1 │ number2 │
│  int32  │  int32  │
├─────────┼─────────┤
│       1 │       2 │
└─────────┴─────────┘
```
but should return only `number1`. 

Alternatively, the combination of `RENAME` and `LIKE` should simply be disallowed.

(Currently, combinations of `RENAME` / `REPLACE` / `EXCLUDE` / `LIKE` are only allowed if [the first modifier is `EXCLUDE` and there is only one additional modifier] or [the combination in this issue, which is broken].)
