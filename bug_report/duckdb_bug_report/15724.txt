Title: Fix #15659: VARCHAR parameters now count as STRING_LITERAL again
Description:
Fixes #15659 

This partially reverts https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12759 for `VARCHAR` columns.

Previously parameters would always count as literals - i.e. passing in a parameter `1` would bind as an `INTEGER_LITERAL`, and a parameter `'str'` would bind as a string literal. This matters because literals have special binding rules where they adopt surrounding types, so string literals can be used as dates, but `VARCHAR` columns cannot (see [literal typing here](https://duckdb.org/2024/02/13/announcing-duckdb-0100.html))

For integer literals this fixes issues where types were ignored causing overflow errors when used in conjunction with smaller integer types. For string literals, however, this can cause previously working code to now throw binder errors. This PR reverts the behavior so that the code in the linked issue works again.
