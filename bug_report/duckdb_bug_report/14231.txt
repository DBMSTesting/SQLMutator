Title: [Dev] Add the ExecutorException class, making use of the EXECUTOR ExceptionType
Description:
Just something I noticed, this is one of the exception types that don't have a dedicated class for it.
I think having a good diversity of exception types is healthy, so the right one can be picked given the context - this makes that easier, than having to write:
```c++
throw duckdb::Exception(duckdb::ExceptionType::EXECUTOR, ss.str());
```
