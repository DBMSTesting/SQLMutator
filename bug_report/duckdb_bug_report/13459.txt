Title: Prepared statements fail for creating secrets
Description:
### What happens?

Hi, was surprised I couldn't parameterize/prepare secret creation (originally in duckdb-node). 

However, doesn't seem to work in the cli either. Feel free to close if this is intentional behaviour.

```
PREPARE shh AS CREATE SECRET (TYPE R2, KEY_ID ?, SECRET ?, ACCOUNT_ID ?);
Parser Error: syntax error at or near "CREATE"
LINE 1: PREPARE shh AS CREATE SECRET (TYPE R2, KEY_ID ?, SECRE...
```

### To Reproduce

Run from cli:

```duckdb
PREPARE shh AS CREATE SECRET (TYPE R2, KEY_ID ?, SECRET ?, ACCOUNT_ID ?);
```
