Title: Support for creating TEMP tables in all catalogs/schemas
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB currently doesn't support creating TEMP tables in different catalogs and it's documented [here](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/create_table.html#temporary-tables).

We can only specify the table name and the schema is always fixed to `temp.main`. While this is a known limitation, it causes issues in our pipeline as we try to create TEMP tables in different schemas with different schemas. We have to remove the catalog/schema in the DDL to make it work and the tables replace each other.

For the record, the same pipeline works fine in major DWH providers (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift) and Postgresql as they all support temp tables under different schemas/databases.

### To Reproduce

 The following query fails:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE main.myschema.stg_device_metadata (device_id TEXT)
```

It can only work if I remove the full qualifier `main.myschema.stg_device_metadata` and use table name `stg_device_metadata`.
