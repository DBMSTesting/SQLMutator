Title: Fix appian join tests
Description:
This should fix the otherside of https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2611

There were some regressions caused exclusively by the join order optimizer. This PR fixes those regressions, and also makes a benchmark from the appian queries. 

The idea behind this PR is to prefer right deep trees so that not as many hash tables occupy memory at the same time.

@maiadegraaf I also had to fix some adbc tests, don't know if that is something you wanna take a look at?
