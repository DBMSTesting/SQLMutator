Title: Fix #14545 - pivot header must be defined in the grammar
Description:
Fix #14545

Yacc "helpfully" allows you to accidentally define an empty token, which defaults to returning nothing,  in the following way:

```
pivot_header:
	| d_expr	                 			{ $$ = list_make1($1); }
```

This PR fixes the issue and makes the query return a syntax error (as it should).
