Title: Fix for joins and FSST on 32-bit configurations
Description:
This PR fixes a number of issues when running DuckDB on a 32-bit operating system:

* The new hash join code incorrectly dealt with 32-bit pointers - we need to explicitly convert them to `uint64_t` when storing them in the hash table at various locations
* `reinterpret_cast<uint64_t>(pointer)` is incorrect on a 32-bit system, we need to do `static_cast<uint64_t>(reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(pointer))`. I've added helper functions for these (`cast_uint64_to_pointer` and `cast_pointer_to_uint64`)
* `unsigned long` and `unsigned long long` are different on 32-bit systems, so we need to use `__builtin_ctzll` and not `__builtin_ctzl`
