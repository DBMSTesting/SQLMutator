Title: Install errors to point to documentation
Description:
Install error messages are at the moment reported by users as confusing, see for example https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/15988

Idea is providing a documentation URL (that is at the moment not existing), where we could also version/platform adapt the error message.
Main advantage is that the error message can be adapted / iterated AFTER a given release is out.

Possibly one implementation would be listing the known extensions / community extensions for a given combination of version and platform.

After this PR:
```
D INSTALL iamnotexisting;
HTTP Error:
Failed to download extension "iamnotexisting" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/061967287d/osx_arm64/iamnotexisting.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 403)

Candidate extensions: "inet", "postgres", "autocomplete", "sqlite", "sqlite_scanner"
For more info, visit https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/troubleshooting/?version=061967287d&platform=osx_arm64&extension=iamnotexisting
```
While otherwise it would be:
```
D INSTALL iamnotexisting;
HTTP Error:
Failed to download extension "iamnotexisting" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/061967287d/osx_arm64/iamnotexisting.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 403)

Candidate extensions: "inet", "postgres", "autocomplete", "sqlite", "sqlite_scanner"
```

Also removing the line:
```
Are you using a development build? In this case, extensions might not (yet) be uploaded.
```
that might happen if extension fails on a known extension, since that information can be included in the docs people are pointed to.

The doc page is not existing (yet).
