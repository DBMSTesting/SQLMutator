Title: Using GROUP BY ALL with conditional projection causes "Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!"
Description:
### What happens?

if you have a conditional projection with GROUP BY ALL,  you get `Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!`

My wish would be that `group by all` could also be applied on conditional projections (if(), case when, etc.).

### To Reproduce

```
create table testgroup (id int, isB2b int, priceGross decimal(10, 2), priceNet decimal(10, 2));
insert into testgroup values (1, 2, 3, 4);

select *, if(isB2b = 1, sum(priceGross), sum(priceNet)) FROM testgroup group by all;
Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!

select *, case when isB2b = 1 then sum(priceGross) else sum(priceNet) end FROM testgroup group by all;
Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!

select *, case when isB2b = 1 then sum(priceGross) else 0 end FROM testgroup group by all;
Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!
```
