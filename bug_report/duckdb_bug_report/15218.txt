Title: CLI: parameter ordering matters for output formats
Description:
### What happens?

It is surprisingly important *where* to put the `-json` argument. I would have not expected that (see repro calls below, please).

### To Reproduce

```interactive
$ duckdb -json -s "select true as b"
[{"b":true}]
$ duckdb -s "select true as b" -json
┌─────────┐
│    b    │
│ boolean │
├─────────┤
│ true    │
└─────────┘
```
