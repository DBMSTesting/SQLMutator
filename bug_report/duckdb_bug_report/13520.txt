Title: string_agg() with "order by" can't join by "_"
Description:
### What happens?

`string_agg(DISTINCT kind order by kind, '_') `
for this code, it could not by joined "_",
for example, if kind is ['A', 'B', 'C'], result would not be A_B_C, but A,B,C.

`string_agg(DISTINCT kind, '_') `
if delete "order by kind", it works well, and result is A_B_C

### To Reproduce

```py
import duckdb
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "kind": ["A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A"],
    "year": [2020, 2020, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2020, 2022],
    "score": [10, 15, 20, 10, 25, 30, 18]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT * FROM df")

result = con.execute("""
    SELECT
        year,
        string_agg(DISTINCT kind order by kind, '_') AS kinds,
        MAX(score) AS max_score
    FROM my_table
    GROUP BY year
""").fetchdf()

print(result)

con.close()
```
