Title: Fix various ci nightly
Description:
Fixing a bunch of compiler errors found looking at different nightly workflows.

`FillFunctionDescriptions` stuff I am not sure how it worked at all.

Moved also some workflow to ubuntu-24.04, while other stay at ubuntu-20.04, that should vary a bit more what's tested.

This should fix Pyodide builds (now there is a mysterious runtime error that might be actual duckdb-python problem in 2 run /3, to be looked at next week) and allow other builds to move from build stage failures further.
