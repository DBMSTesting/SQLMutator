Title: Fix regex_string_split to handle empty string characters
Description:
This PR, in combination with PR #13108, resolves bug #10811 by updating the `regex_string_split` function to handle empty string characters correctly. New test cases have also been added.

Previously, the `Split` function was incorrectly matching individual characters when using boundary markers like `\b` by continuing the search from the remaining portion of the input string after each match. For that, an offset mechanism has been introduced, allowing the function to search for matches without modifying the input string.

**Note**: A new check has been added to determine if the delimiter matches an empty string or a word boundary before starting the split process. If the delimiter is an empty string char, the function will first find all matches and then split the string at each match. This check ensures that the additional functionality is only triggered when needed, preventing unnecessary overhead for other delimiters.
