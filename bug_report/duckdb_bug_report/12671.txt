Title: [Block Size] String block limit and a few other places
Description:
As the PR title says, this PR removes the `STRING_BLOCK_LIMIT` constant by adapting it to the block size.

@samansmink, I ran all benchmarks in `benchmark/micro/compression/fsst*`, and did not notice a regression. So I assume reusing the same `vector` does not impact performance.

Note that there also a few other places in this PR where I removed `*_BLOCK_SIZE`
