Title: Compressed materialization for joins
Description:
I initially wanted to add this in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/7644 but ended up scrapping it because I wanted to do too many things in a single PR and had to scope it down. I saved the code, though, which works with some minor modifications!

So, this PR adds support to compress the build-side of `LogicalComparisonJoin` based on available statistics to reduce memory footprint. I've added some constants to prevent this from triggering too eagerly (some good old "defensive programming"), to reduce the chances of performance regressions when everything fits in main memory. We can expect a similar compression ratio as with aggregation/order by, which can prevent/reduce the need for spilling intermediates to storage.
