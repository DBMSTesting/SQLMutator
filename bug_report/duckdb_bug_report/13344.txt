Title: [Transformer] Fix loss of named parameter data in recursive TransformStatement calls
Description:
This PR fixes #13193

TransformStatement moved the `named_param_map` that it had populated into the created SQLStatement, in the case of recursive calls that meant that the outer SQLStatement would not receive any named parameters.
