Title: Add ifdef to allow generating code with newer versions of Bison
Description:
This disables the patch https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13280 when generating code with newer versions of Bison. This allows generating the parser and working with it - but stack growing will not be enabled for newer version.
