Title: Python UDF is not executed in parallel
Description:
### What happens?

When using Python UDFs the code-path is not executed in parallel. I presume this limitation does not have to be applied when `side_effects=False` applies.

### To Reproduce

```
SELECT embedding(object, 'ScheduledStopPoint') AS o FROM ScheduledStopPoint;
```
Since embedding does apply to each individual row, I don't see why this UDF cannot be executed in parallel, there is no interdependency.
