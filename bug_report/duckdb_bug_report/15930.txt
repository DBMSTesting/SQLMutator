Title: Invisible characters in DuckDB 1.2 with default Solarized Dark theme
Description:
(Opening this as requested by @carlopi on Bluesky.)

### What happens?

SQL comments and borders around results aren't visible in DuckDB 1.2 when using the standard "iTerm2 Solarized Dark" theme.

### To Reproduce

Install [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/docs) and configure `theme = iTerm2 Solarized Dark`.

Note that with `theme = Solarized Dark - Patched`, the invisible characters become visible:

This indicates [a general problem with the theme itself](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35801832/how-to-solve-the-conflict-with-the-color-of-dark-solarized-and-some-output).

That said, I'm fine with closing this, it is just something to be aware of with the recent release (I never had this problem before).
