Title: ParsedExpression::Hasparameter returns false in case of replace list has placeholders
Description:
### What happens?

In following SQL, `HasParameter method` of `ParsedExpression` (`StarExpression`) returns false:

```sql
select * replace(i * $n as i)
from range(1, 10) t(i)
```

This SQL has a placeholder in replace list.

In current implementation, `ParsedExpression::HasParameter` method uses `ExpressionIterator::EnumerateChildren` method to iterate children.

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/10c42435f1805ee4415faa5d6da4943e8c98fa55/src/planner/expression.cpp#L89

`ExpressionIterator::EnumerateChildren` is only captured `StarExpression::expr` field.
So `StarExpression::replace_list` does not capture.

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/10c42435f1805ee4415faa5d6da4943e8c98fa55/src/parser/parsed_expression_iterator.cpp#L100

~~And I seems that `StarExpression::exclude_list` is not also captured in case of using lambda expression with placeholder.~~
EDIT: `exclude_list` does not contain `ParsedExpression. So it has no problem.

Is this expected behavior?


### To Reproduce

```cpp
std::string sql = "select * replace(i * $n as i) from range(1, 10) t(i)";
auto stmts = conn.ExtractStatements(sql);

auto& select_stmt = stmts[0]->Cast<duckdb::SelectStatement>();
auto& select_node = select_stmt.node->Cast<duckdb::SelectNode>();

std::cout << select_node.select_list[0]->HasParameter() << std::endl;
```

Expected result: true
Actual result: false
