Title: Issue #12600: Streaming Positive LAG
Description:
Use buffering to support streaming computation of constant positive LAGs and negative LEADs that are at most one vector away. This doesn't fix the "look ahead" problem, but the benchmark shows it is about 5x faster than the non-streaming version.
