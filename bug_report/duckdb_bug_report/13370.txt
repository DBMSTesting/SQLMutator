Title: Update jemalloc and re-enable opt.retain
Description:
Updating jemalloc and tweaking the settings seems to have resolved the problem, so we can now re-enable this setting again, which should prevent us from running out of VM space. I've also added `#ifdef`s so we can use jemalloc on MacOS properly. This should allow me to find potential issues earlier.

I also removed two assertions in `temporary_memory_manager.cpp` as they were just plain wrong.
