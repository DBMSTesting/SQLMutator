Title: Add missing TransformCTE extraction to TransformRecursiveCTE
Description:
Without this PR it is possible to execute the following query:

```sql
WITH
  t(b) AS MATERIALIZED (
    (WITH helper(c) AS (
      SELECT 5
    )
    SELECT * FROM helper h
    UNION
    SELECT 7
    )
  )
SELECT * FROM t;
```

However, if the `WITH`-clause is marked as `RECURSIVE`, `TransformCTE` takes a different code path which did not extract the `WITH`-clause within `t`. Therefore, CTE `helper` could not be found. This is an _unholy interaction_ between `WITH RECURSIVE`, `UNION`, and a nested `WITH`.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE
  t(b) AS MATERIALIZED (
    (WITH helper(c) AS (
      SELECT 5
    )
    SELECT * FROM helper h
    UNION
    SELECT 7
    )
  )
SELECT * FROM t;
```

This PR adds the necessary extraction.
