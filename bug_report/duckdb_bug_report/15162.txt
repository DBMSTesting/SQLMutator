Title: Incorrect EXPLAIN details for query
Description:
### What happens?

Firstly, the query works as expected, but EXPLAIN is giving an error in the output.
The predicate in my subquery only returns a single row, yet I get the following from EXPLAIN.


```┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
│         PROJECTION        │
│    ────────────────────   │
│ CASE  WHEN ((#1 > 1)) THEN│
│  (error('More than one row│
│   returned by a subquery  │
│   used as an expression - │
│    scalar subqueries can  │
│  only return a single row.│
│          Use "SET         │
│ scalar_subquery_error_on_m│
│   ultiple_rows=false" to  │
│     revert to previous    │
│   behavior of returning a │
│ random row.')) ELSE #0 END│
│                           │
│          ~1 Rows          │
└─────────────┬─────────────┘
```

### To Reproduce

```sql
create schema repro
;

create table repro.file_load_history(
     filename           varchar     not null
    ,load_timestamp     timestamp   not null
)
;

create table repro.load_on_first_run(
     id         int
    ,who        varchar
    ,event_date date
)
;


-- only allow insertions if file_load_history table has one or less rows
explain 
insert into repro.load_on_first_run
    select 
           0                        as id
          ,'system'                 as who
          ,current_timestamp::date  as event_date
    where 1=1
          and (select case when count(1) <=1 then true else false end as x from repro.file_load_history) 
;          
```
