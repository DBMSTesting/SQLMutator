Title: Implement `DELTA_BINARY_PACKED` compression in Parquet writer
Description:
As the title explains, this PR implements `DELTA_BINARY_PACKED` compression for the Parquet writer. I've reused our own bitpacking code to achieve this. I've reworked the reader to also use our own bitpacking code. The compression ratio for integral columns should be much better now.

I've added this on a branch where I was enabling ARM Neon SIMD instructions for Snappy on AArch64. I found out that _Neon is always available/enabled on AArch64_! This means we can enable it in Snappy to enjoy faster (de-)compression on this CPU architecture. For x86 it's much harder to enable SIMD, as it is non-portable to older CPUs. ARM is relatively young in that sense, and we can safely enable it.
