Title: Time cast: Have same behavior as Postgres
Description:
These cast changes will allow the following casts to work in a similar fashion as Postgres:

```sql
SELECT '11:'::TIME
----
11:00:00

query I
SELECT '11:1'::TIME
----
11:01:00

query I
SELECT '11:11'::TIME
----
11:11:00

query I
SELECT '11:11:'::TIME
----
11:11:00
```

A side effect of fixing these casts, is that the CSV Reader can also now detect `time` types on columns with similar data.
