Title: [Python] Fix missing ConnectionException errors
Description:
This PR fixes #12818 

This InternalException originates from accessing members of the connection that are deleted whenever the object is reset.
Previously we dealt with this by checking for null before attempting to access them.

This became unwieldy and many methods ended up not being covered.
We fix the problem by not making it possible to get these objects without first going through the ConnectionGuard, which does the nullptr check.
