Title: [Python] Align the behavior between `sql` and `execute` for `.pl()` call
Description:
This PR fixes #15528 

When using `sql` (or `query`) followed by `.pl()` the produced polars dataframe has deduplicated columns
With `.execute` the second occurrence of the duplicated name was deleted, this has been fixed.
