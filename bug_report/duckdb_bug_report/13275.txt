Title: Fix casts logic
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13226

Couple of mistakes on top of each other, independent, fixed both.

Brief recap on the situation of the casts AFTER this PR:

* NumericCast is a checked cast, meaning that, roughly speaking, it should be invertible
* UnsafeNumericCast is equivalent to NumericCast when DEBUG or it's a static_cast
* LossyNumericCast, that takes only float/double (for now, probably will be expanded for all types) is equivalent to static_cast

Note that UnsafeNumericCast is still requires to be information preserving, but will not be checked in the configuration we care the most that is Release.
