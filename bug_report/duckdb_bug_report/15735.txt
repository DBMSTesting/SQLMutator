Title: HTTP Error: Failed to download extension "httpfs" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.1.3/windows_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 503)
Description:
### What happens?

I am trying to use httpfs.

On macOS, the code works well. However, in Windows, it has issues.

### To Reproduce

```py
from pathlib import Path
import re
import duckdb

def main(parquet_url: str) -> None:
    with duckdb.connect() as conn:
        try:
            conn.execute("set enable_progress_bar=true")
            conn.execute(
                f"""
                    create secret if not exists http_auth (
                        type http,
                        bearer_token 'xxx'
                    )
                """,
            )

            logger.info("Loading data...")
            conn.execute(f"""
                create table if not exists my_table as
                select * from read_parquet('{parquet_url}')
            """)

            # Query from cached table
            query = f"""
                select *
                from {table_name}
            """
            df = conn.execute(query).pl()
            print(df)
        except Exception:
            print("An error occurred")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    parquet_url = "https://data-browser.internal.hongbomiao.com/my.parquet"
    main(parquet_url)
```

gives error

```sh
PS C:\query-https-data> python src/main.py

Extension "httpfs" is an existing extension.

Install it first using "INSTALL httpfs".
```

I also tried use DuckDB CLI to install httpfs, but got same error.

```sh
PS C:\query-https-data> duckdb
v1.1.3 19864453f7
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D install httpfs;
HTTP Error: Failed to download extension "httpfs" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.1.3/windows_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 503)
Extension "httpfs" is an existing extension.
```

I feel it may be caused by the `http` used in `http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.1.3/windows_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz` which should be `https`.

I can access this https URL successfully by browser/
