Title: Introduce 2 new platforms: `musllinux_arm64` and `musllinux_amd64`
Description:
Adapt platform detection logic to handle detection for musl.

This can be tested by building in an alpine dockerized environment where platform will correctly set to a `linux_*_musl` variant.

Extension builds will first introduced (possibly in parallel) to duckdb/extension-ci-tools, then same infrastructure can be used here for build extensions (and a a side effect run tests on them).

Note that while tecnically it's already possible to build for the `linux_amd64_musl` or `musllinux_arm64_musl` platforms by providing an explicit custom platform, this change will make that building DuckDB by default on musl-based system will be classified as using musl.


Example output using the dockerized test workflow:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│    platform     │
│     varchar     │
├─────────────────┤
│ linux_amd64_musl │
└─────────────────┘
```
