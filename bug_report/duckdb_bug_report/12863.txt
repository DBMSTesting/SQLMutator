Title: INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS doesn't list foreign keys when declaration case doesn't match reference case
Description:
### What happens?

When I'm not careful to always use the same case for identifiers, then it may happen that `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS` doesn't list a foreign key even if it is clearly there

### To Reproduce

Create this schema (observe the case of `a` (declaration) vs `A` (reference))

```sql
CREATE TABLE a (id int PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE TABLE b (id int REFERENCES A);
```

This query doesn't produce any results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.referential_constraints;
```

Though this query shows, the constraint is clearly there:

```sql
SELECT constraint_text FROM duckdb_constraints() WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
```

The fix is currently to be more careful with the case of the referencing table (though, it shouldn't matter):

```sql
DROP TABLE b;
CREATE TABLE b (id int REFERENCES a);
```

Now, I can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS` view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.referential_constraints;
```

Resulting in:

```
|constraint_catalog|constraint_schema|constraint_name|unique_constraint_catalog|unique_constraint_schema|unique_constraint_name|match_option|update_rule|delete_rule|
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
|duckdb-dummy      |main             |b_id_fkey      |duckdb-dummy             |main                    |a_id_pkey             |NONE        |NO ACTION  |NO ACTION  |
```
