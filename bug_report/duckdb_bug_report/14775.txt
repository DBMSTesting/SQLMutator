Title: Internal #3263: Window Distinct Deadlock
Description:
More like a hang.  Seems to be caused by a local state being allocated by the pipeline code during a DISTINCT finalize step. This would increment the thread count used by the DISTINCT aggregator without creating a task to process some rows.

The fix is to not use the thread number but actually count the number of local sorts created.
