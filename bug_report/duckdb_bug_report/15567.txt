Surprised this wasn't caught sooner. Through a missed case expression, the build side costs for the children of an asof join would be initialized to 0, so for many cases, asof join children would not be swapped. However, we prefer right deep trees, so if the left child of an asof join has children, then the asof join children would still get swapped. 

Asof Joins should not be swapped period since they are more of a table lookup than a join. This code fixes parts of the build side probe side optimizer to not swap asof joins.
