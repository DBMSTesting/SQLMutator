Title: copy to operator still write schema for empty rows
Description:
physical_copy_to operator currently skip empty source when using multi thread writing, in this case, recording the schema to filesystem might be a better way, as we still need the info instead of nothing. This also aligns with the behaviour of single thread writing.
