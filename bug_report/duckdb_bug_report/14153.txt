Title: Querying single Parquet file in S3
Description:
### What happens?

I created a secret with key_id / secret / session_token, and attempted to run a select query on a parquet file.  This is the error I got:

```
[Code: 0, SQL State: ]  java.sql.SQLException: INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL!
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```

### To Reproduce

```
install aws; load aws;

create secret tbsbeta (
    type s3,
    key_id 'KEY',
    secret 'SECRET,
    session_token TOKEN'
);

FROM duckdb_secrets();



select * from 's3://BUCKET/KEY.parquet'
```
