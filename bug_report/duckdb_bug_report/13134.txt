Title: Parser error: memory exhausted
Description:
### What happens?

Trying to execute a big SQL query results in an error:
```
duckdb.duckdb.ParserException: Parser Error: memory exhausted at or near "*"
```
(I think the ParserException is from Python, and the Parser Error is from the duckdb engine itself).
Error doesn't appear until roughly 400KB of query size, although I haven't yet determined the exact threshold.
For context, I'm concatenating ~100 tables, using Python Ibis to generate the SQL. 

### To Reproduce

In CLI: 
```
.read query.txt
```
Version 0.10.3 gives the error, but you have to scroll up to see it.
