Title: Table locks - always grab table locks through the transaction interface 
Description:
This is a follow-up PR from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13712 that removes the code-paths that grabbed the table lock through a different manner, avoiding the transaction-level interface. Looking at the code this seems to only be used in the WAL - so it's unlikely this would actually cause problems, but it's better to clean up this code path entirely so it doesn't get accidentally used in the future.
