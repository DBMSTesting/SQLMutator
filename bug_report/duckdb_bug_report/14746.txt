Title: Rework `BlockHandle` to no longer have friend classes, and rework `ConvertToPersistent` so it fails if there are active outstanding pins
Description:
This PR reworks the `BlockHandle` class to remove all of the friend classes, and instead use a less error-prone interface that requires passing the `BlockLock` into the methods when accessing members that require locks (e.g. the buffer or memory usage fields).

In addition, we rework the `ConvertToPersistent` method so that it throws an error when there are active readers, and fix cases where this was the case. In all of the cases where this happened the handle would have been destroyed shortly after the `ConvertToPersistent` was completed anyway.
