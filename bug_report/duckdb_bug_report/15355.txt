Title: ATTACH OR REPLACE database to allow swapping of new data.
Description:
Addresses #15208 

Adds support for replacing existing attached database.

This is just a proposal for more concrete discussion, but no worries at all if this doesn't fit with the vision for ATTACH functionality in DuckDB. This is my first PR to DuckDB so apologies ahead of time if I missed something critical.

Example usage:
```sql
-- Attach as usual
ATTACH 'taxi_v1.duckdb' AS taxi;
-- New file comes in, attach new file which automatically detaches the old one
ATTACH OR REPLACE 'taxi_v2.duckdb' AS taxi;
```

Application query:
```sql
-- Query can stay the same, without needing to update the DB name, nor deal with DETACH etc.
SELECT DISTINCT vendor_name FROM taxi.taxi_data;
```
