Title: Spurious non-zero results in `age(current_time)`
Description:
### What happens?

`age(current_time)` should be zero (the way it's currently defined, although that's PostgreSQL incompatible, see https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15067), but returns non-zero values.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SET timezone='UTC';
SELECT age(current_timestamp)
```
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ age(current_timestamp) │
│        interval        │
├────────────────────────┤
│ 00:00:00.001           │
└────────────────────────┘
```
