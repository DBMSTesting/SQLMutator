Title: Issue #16098: ValidEnd Parallel Vectorisation
Description:
ValidEnd was still using the old valid_start inter-chunk state variable
instead of reading the correct value from the already computed ValidBegin vector.
This would in turn generate incorrect bounds for RANGE FOLLOWING searches,
leading to erratic frame bounds.

ValidEnd was also incorrectly setting up the prev values to optimise the search,
instead of having the frame functions set it up for each chunk.
