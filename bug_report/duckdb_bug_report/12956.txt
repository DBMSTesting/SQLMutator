Title: fix incorrect int32 appender
Description:
Fix #12946

This PR fixes a bug in the julia client, where `Int32` values are incorrectly truncated modulo `Int16` by the appender, which is problematic for large `Int32` values (see #12946 for a more thorough description).

The fix seemed trivial so I've made a PR with the fix and added tests (the extra tests would fail on the current main branch). I've also bumped the patch number of the julia pkg version: it would be great to get a new release with the patch if that's possible
