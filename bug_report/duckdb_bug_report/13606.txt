Title: Avoid adding buffers that will be destroyed to the eviction queue
Description:
When we deallocate a lot of temporary data, e.g., when destroying a hash table after we're done with it, we unpin all of the associated `BufferHandle`s and destroy all `BlockHandle`s. The former puts the buffer in the eviction queue, while the latter destroys the buffer, which immediately creates a "dead node" in the eviction queue.

While we want these blocks to enter the eviction queue for most of their lifetime, as this allows us to spill to disk for out-of-core processing, we don't want them to enter the eviction queue when they will be destroyed anyway. This PR allows a flag to be set for blocks that prevents them from being added to the eviction queue at all, so we don't end up clogging the queue with a bunch of dead nodes.
