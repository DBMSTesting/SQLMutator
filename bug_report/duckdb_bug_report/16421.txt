Title: Fix PyPi upload also for branches, when twine_upload is provided
Description:
Moved conditions around, but should be the same as before but for providing a way to override the logic that says: either `override_git_describe` is provided or needs to be on `main` branch.

This can be used to distribute Python packages for branches.
