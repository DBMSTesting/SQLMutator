Title: [Python UDF] Filter `NULL` values before calling the user defined function
Description:
This PR fixes #13138 

This only applies to UDFs that use the default null handling (default behavior).

For both `native` and `arrow` UDF types, nulls are filtered out of the input that is sent to the user defined function.
On return to DuckDB the created result is converted to a DataChunk and the rows that were filtered out are replaced with NULL in the final result.

DuckDB side input:
```
┌─────────┐
│    a    │
│ varchar │
├─────────┤
│ 12      │
│ NULL    │
│ 42      │
└─────────┘
```

Received data by the UDF:
```
┌─────────┐
│    a    │
│ varchar │
├─────────┤
│ 12      │
│ 42      │
└─────────┘
```

In this example:
The resulting row produced by the UDF at (0 indexed) row 1 will be placed at row 2 in the final result.
