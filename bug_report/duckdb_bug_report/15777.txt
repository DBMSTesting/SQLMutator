Title: COPY statement fails when dateformat='AUTO' is Set By User, but succeeds when AUTO is Auto-Detected
Description:
### What happens?

When running a copy statement, the copy fails if dateformat is explicitly set to AUTO in the copy statement.  However, if it is not **explicitly** set to auto in the copy statement, it's treated as auto and works.

### To Reproduce

To reproduce, use these CSVs:
[date_example_1.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18460648/date_example_1.csv)
[date_example_2.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18460647/date_example_2.csv)

And run the following code:
```
create or replace temp table date_tests (col1 date);

-- Working cases (AUTO is Auto-Detected):
copy date_tests from 'date_example_1.csv';
copy date_tests from 'date_example_2.csv';

-- Failed cases (AUTO is Set By User)
-- file's date format is YYYY-MM-DD
copy date_tests from 'date_example_1.csv' WITH (dateformat 'AUTO');
-- file's date format is %m/%d/%y
copy date_tests from 'date_example_2.csv' WITH (dateformat 'AUTO');
```

date_example_1.csv:
date_example
2023-12-17
2023-12-14
2023-12-20

date_example_2.csv:
date_example
12/17/23
12/14/23
12/20/23
