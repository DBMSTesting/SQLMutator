Title: JSON_EXTRACT and similar functions don't allow for distinguishing between SQL NULL and JSON null
Description:
### What happens?

When a JSON document contains JSON `null` values, I cannot extract them, i.e. distinguish between the presence of a `null` value and the absence of the value.

### To Reproduce

Consider these two queries:

```sql
SELECT json '{"a":1,"b":null}'->'b';
SELECT json '[1, 2, null]'->2;
```

They should both produce `CAST('null' AS JSON)`. But they produce `CAST(NULL AS JSON)`, instead. As such, I cannot be certain if the value exists in the document at all, or not. E.g. the result is the same as for these queries, where the value is absent:

```sql
SELECT json '{"a":1,"b":null}'->'c';
SELECT json '[1, 2, null]'->3;
```

E.g. MySQL and PostgreSQL don't expose this behaviour but clearly distinguish between SQL `NULL` and JSON `null`.

A workaround seems to be to check also `JSON_TYPE`:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(j->'b', CASE WHEN json_type(j, 'b') = 'NULL' THEN CAST('null' AS JSON) END)
FROM
  (VALUES (json '{"a":1,"b":null}')) AS j (j);
```

But that workaround doesn't work in general if the JSON path is an expression, see this related problem:

- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13436

I cannot think of other workarounds right now, given that most standard SQL JSON features aren't available either, including `JSON_EXISTS` or `JSON_QUERY`, etc.

At first, I thought this bug here might not be a bug, but just a limitation. But given #13436, I got sceptical
