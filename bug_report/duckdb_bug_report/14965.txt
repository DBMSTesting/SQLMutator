Title: Explicit install of pkg-config broke, removing it
Description:
This should restore OSX extensions on nightly, tested on the full CI on my fork at https://github.com/carlopi/duckdb/actions/runs/11999095103.

This is same PR as https://github.com/duckdb/extension-ci-tools/pull/115.

Note that CI do not test anything here, since OSX extensions are skipped on PRs.
