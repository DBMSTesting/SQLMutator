Title: Allow switching to a different catalog from a detached catalog
Description:
In a multi-connection setting, if con1's default database is detached by another connection, switching to a different catalog using `USE other_db` in con1 throws a binder error. The reason is that DuckDB calls `GetCatalog` for the detached default database to search if the `other_db` matches one of the schemas there. A workaround was to use a fully qualified name: `SET search_path='other_db.main'`. 

This PR allows users to get out of the detached catalog using the `USE` statement.
