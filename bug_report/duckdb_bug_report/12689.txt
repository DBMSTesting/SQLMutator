Title: Add configurable thresholds for using nested loop join and merge join
Description:
This PR adds the `nested_loop_join_threshold` and `merge_join_threshold` settings - that can be used to configure at which estimated cardinality to switch to using these join types. The `nested_loop_join_threshold ` already existed before internally - but is now configurable. The `merge_join_threshold` setting is new.

The nested loop join and piecewise merge join are usually slower than the more sophisticated joins (e.g. IE join), but can perform better when one of the input tables is very small. In addition, since they avoid materialization they can consume less memory in these scenarios as well.

Usage:

```sql
SET nested_loop_join_threshold=999;
SET merge_join_join_threshold=999;
```
