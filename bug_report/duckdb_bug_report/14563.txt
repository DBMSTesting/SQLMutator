Title: Scoping problem with function argument
Description:
### What happens?

Somehow, `z` seems to disappear:
```sql
create or replace function demo(n, z) as table (
  select list_transform(range(0,n), x -> z) as row
);  

from demo(3,0);
```
```
Binder Error: Referenced column "z" not found in FROM clause!
```



### To Reproduce

```sql
create or replace function demo(n, z) as table (
  select list_transform(range(0,n), x -> z) as row
);  

from demo(3,0);
```
