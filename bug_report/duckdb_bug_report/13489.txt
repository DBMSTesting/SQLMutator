Title: Use new HLL implementation in `DistinctStatistics`
Description:
After @hawkfish's excellent rework of our `approx_count_distinct` aggregate function in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12355, which uses HyperLogLog to estimate the unique value count, I've also replaced the HyperLogLog in `DistinctStatistics` in storage.

The new HLL is much smaller to store and hold in memory. DuckDB databases with the old HLL can still be read, but the old HLL will be discarded, and distinct counts (and, therefore, join ordering) will be wrong. Happy to receive feedback on this PR on options to improve this (if we want to).
