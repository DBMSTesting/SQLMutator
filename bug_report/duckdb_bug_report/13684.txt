Title: json_deserialize_sql(): Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL
Description:
### What happens?

Playing around with `json_deserialize_sql()` with some malformed JSON leads to this error:

```
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: Attempting to execute an unsuccessful or closed pending query result
Error: INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL!
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```


I know that the JSON that I've provided isn't actually a valid serialized statement, I was just testing the capabilities if it would the `json_deserialize_sql()` would deserialize a part of a statement.



### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb
import json

con = duckdb.connect(":memory:")

filter_json = {
    "expression_class": "BOUND_COMPARISON",
    "type": "COMPARE_EQUAL",
    "left": {
        "expression_class": "BOUND_COLUMN_REF",
        "type": "BOUND_COLUMN_REF",
        "alias": "r",
        "return_type": {"id": "VARCHAR"},
    },
    "right": {
        "expression_class": "BOUND_CONSTANT",
        "type": "VALUE_CONSTANT",
        "value": {
            "type": {"id": "VARCHAR"},
            "is_null": False,
            "value": "u",
        },
    },
}

result = con.execute(
    "select json_deserialize_sql(?)", [json.dumps({"statements": [filter_json]})]
).fetchall()
```
