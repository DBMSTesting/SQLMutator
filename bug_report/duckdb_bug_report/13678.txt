Title: Avoid short-circuiting to cut on TABLE_IN_OUT_FUNCTION
Description:
Attempt at fixing https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13664 and https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13666, and adding test checking that.

This is more a draft / experiment, I am not really comfortable with the code changes without some more backing, opening as a draft to get feedback.
Based on the investigation by @cpcloud in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13666#issuecomment-2322903801 (thanks!).
