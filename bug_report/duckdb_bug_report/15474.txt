Title: [Julia]: Auto-generate api.jl  (requires duckdb v1.2?)
Description:
This PR adds a python script (`generate_c_api_julia.py`) to automatically generate function definitions for the DuckDB C-API in `api.jl`. It also generates documentation and deprecation warning (via `Base.depwarn`) if this information is given.

It fixes various types, where `api.jl` had mismatches between the types that where defined in `duckdb.h` and uncovered to usage of some deprecated functions. Also some functions to convert between types have been added to `ctypes.jl`.

It uses a similiar logic that is used to generate `duckdb.h` and uses the definitions from`src/include/duckdb/main/capi/header_generation/apis`. These are created for `v1.2`, so this changes most likely require this version as well.

I hope this can be used to keep the Julia Pkg more easily up-to-date with DuckDB :) 


_Note_: For easy review, the original order of the functions is kept. This can be changed in a future PR to be consistent to `duckdb.h`
