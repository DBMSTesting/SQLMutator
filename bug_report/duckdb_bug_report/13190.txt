Title: Add test_collate_pivot: used to fail in 1.0.0, add to avoid regressions
Description:
Raised by a duckdb-wasm user on https://discord.duckdb.org/, adding test to check this keeps working, but I think this is already fixed.

Workaround in duckdb v1.0.0 is removing the line `PRAGMA default_collation=NOACCENT;`

This might be covered by other tests already, unsure if worth adding, PR is to check this actually works in tested configurations, and to be considered as addition.
