Title: [Dev] Override a couple virtual destructors from base classes
Description:
With my (perhaps limited) understanding of C++, not overriding a virtual destructor causes the members added by the derived class to not be destroyed when `delete` is called on the object as a `<base class> *`

Perhaps this is added implicitly somehow, but it can't hurt to be explicit about it
