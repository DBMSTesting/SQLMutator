Title: Optimistic write to WAL: cannot write block pointers if we have in-memory updates to transaction local storage
Description:
Follow-up fix from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13372

We cannot write block pointers to optimistically written transaction-local data to the WAL if we have updated that transaction-local data, as the updates are not reflected in the on-disk contents. Instead, we fall back to the old method of writing the actual data to the WAL.
