Title: Avoid unnecessarily projecting the input columns of the UNPIVOT operator in the UNNEST
Description:
 Fixes #13552

This greatly improves performance when unpivoting on many columns. Previously these columns would be projected out and then immediately discarded - leading to a lot of wasted time.

Below is a benchmark where we are unpivoting 10,000 columns:

```sql
create table r as select id, concat('column_', id) as column_name, concat('value_', id) as  column_value from (select unnest(generate_series(1,10000)) as id);
create table pivoted as pivot r on column_name using first(id) group by id;
select count(*) from (unpivot pivoted on columns(* exclude id) into name 'column_name' value 'column_value');
```
