Title: Clean-up stack traces on MacOS, fix demangling on Linux, and add `EXPORT_DYNAMIC_SYMBOLS` flag which enables stack traces on Linux
Description:
* Clean up stack traces on MacOS by removing the pointers and excess spacing
* Fix demangling on Linux by correctly finding the mangled symbol in the stack trace information
* Add `EXPORT_DYNAMIC_SYMBOLS` flag which exports symbols, allowing stack traces to be printed on Linux as well
