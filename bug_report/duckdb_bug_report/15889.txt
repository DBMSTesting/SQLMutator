Title: Several nightly CI fixes
Description:
* Skip storage version test on vsize <> 2048
* Add checkpoint to tests that explicitly check compression methods/etc so they work with alternative verify
* Skip `test_art_union.test` for `no_alternative_verify` - there is an issue where CreateIndex binds during the wal_replay that needs to be fixed to address this
