Title: List has bind fix
Description:
The bind function of `list_has_all` was not idempotent, causing incorrect results when re-binding. Additionally, neither `list_has_all` or `list_has_any` handled parameterized arguments correctly. Since the binding function is the same for both of them now I've unified them into the same .cpp file.

Fixes an internal issue.
