Title: current_timestamp bad performance in Linux
Description:
### What happens?

When running the application in Linux we have noticed a degradation when comparing with Windows version
Whe have run perf command and noticed some internal exceptions being thrown 
For some reason, when query has a current_timestamp usage we see ColumnNotFound exception in the traces and a lot of CPU is stuck in " __backtrace_symbols"
