Title: Avoid running autoloading tests from remote when not deploying
Description:
Yet another step to streamlining uploads and fixing a problem with testing loading from remote endpoints in Windows workflow. This can't be done BEFORE actually uploading.

The tests needs to be reviewed post v1.2.0, now avoiding the failure and unifying the code more.

This avoids errors like tonight nightly run: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/13104026020/job/36557104073.
