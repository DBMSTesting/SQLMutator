Title: Speed up Main CI workflow
Description:
* Add a new `--tests-per-invocation` parameter to `run_tests_one_by_one`, that allows running a variable number of tests per `unittest` invocation. On Linux starting up `unittest` in debug mode is very slow, causing every start-up to take ~1 second. With `run_tests_one_by_one` we launch `unittest` for every test - and with 3600 tests that is a full hour (!) spend on starting up/shutting down the unittest program. This parameter allows us to batch the tests without having to run all tests at once.
* Split up `Linux Debug` into two separate workflows - `Linux Debug (1)` runs the first 2000 tests, `Linux Debug (2)` runs the remaining tests
* The remaining CI jobs in `Main` no longer depend on `Linux Debug`, we instead always run `Force Storage` and have the remaining CI jobs depend on `Force Storage`
* Move various slow tests to `.test_slow`
