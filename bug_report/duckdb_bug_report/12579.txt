Title: Fix trouble to compile with MSVC
Description:
Remove std::forward here since MSVC does not compile with it. It issues a cryptic error message:

...\duckdb-src\third_party\libpg_query\postgres_parser.cpp(43): error C2243: 'type cast': conversion from 'std::vector<duckdb_libpgquery::PGKeyword,std::allocator<duckdb_libpgquery::PGKeyword>> *' to '_Ty &&' exists, but is inaccessible
          with
          [
              _Ty=duckdb::vector<duckdb_libpgquery::PGKeyword,true>
          ]

But the real problem seems to be that std::forward should not really be used here.
