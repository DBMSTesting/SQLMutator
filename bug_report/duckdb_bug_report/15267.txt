Title: unescaped double-quote in column lookup in Python relational API
Description:
### What happens?

When using the python relational API, column names with `"` in them don't seem to be escaped properly.

### To Reproduce

python code:

```
import duckdb
c = duckdb.connect()
t = c.sql('select 1 as "tricky"", ""quotes", 2 as tricky, 3 as quotes')

print("t:")
print(t)

print("t[t.columns[0]]:")
print(t[t.columns[0]])
```

output:

```
t:
┌──────────────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ tricky", "quotes │ tricky │ quotes │
│      int32       │ int32  │ int32  │
├──────────────────┼────────┼────────┤
│                1 │      2 │      3 │
└──────────────────┴────────┴────────┘

t[t.columns[0]]:
┌────────┬────────┐
│ tricky │ quotes │
│ int32  │ int32  │
├────────┼────────┤
│      2 │      3 │
└────────┴────────┘
```

It looks like internally it's translating that lookup to `SELECT "tricky", "quotes"` instead of the correct `SELECT "tricky"", ""quotes"`
