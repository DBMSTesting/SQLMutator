Title: Unexpected result when using `BETWEEN` and `CASE WHEN`
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test case. The second query returned `false`, showing that the expression `(((CASE t0.c0 WHEN t0.c0 THEN t0.c0 END ) BETWEEN 1 AND t0.c0)AND(t0.c0 <= 0))` should be evaluated to `false`; however, the third query return `-1`, which is unexpected.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE  t0(c0 INT);
INSERT INTO t0( c0) VALUES ( -1);

SELECT * FROM t0; -- -1
SELECT (((CASE t0.c0 WHEN t0.c0 THEN t0.c0 END ) BETWEEN 1 AND t0.c0)AND(t0.c0 <= 0)) FROM t0; -- false
SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE (((CASE t0.c0 WHEN t0.c0 THEN t0.c0 END ) BETWEEN 1 AND t0.c0)AND(t0.c0 <= 0)) ;
-- Expected: empty table
-- Actual: -1
```
