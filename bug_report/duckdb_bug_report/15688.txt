Title: Clean up temporary test directory in `run_tests_one_by_one.py` even if test segfaults
Description:
The cleanup is built into our `unittest` executable, but the cleanup doesn't happen if a test segfaults. If the test that segfaults uses a lot of space, subsequent tests may run out of disk space (GH actions don't have that much disk space). This PR makes sure the test dir is cleaned up in such cases.
