Title: [Arrow] Move `ArrowUtil` to its own file
Description:
Nothing major, this is just a chore.
For probably over 80% of our classes we have them live in their own files, when I see `ArrowUtil` I would like to automatically navigate to the correct file, the current structure breaks my path assumption.
