Title: [Python] Add `python_scan_all_frames` to opt-in to scanning all frames (< 1.1 behavior)
Description:
This PR fixes #13836

Using `con.execute("set python_scan_all_frames=true")` we will scan all frames again when performing a replacement scan.
Meaning that if `df` is not defined in the current scope, but it is defined in the previous scope (or deeper), then it will still be found if this setting is flipped to true.
