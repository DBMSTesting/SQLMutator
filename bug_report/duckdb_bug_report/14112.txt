Title: feed table function into multifilereader initialization
Description:
perhaps a little (too?) hacky, but this allows injecting state into the MultiFileReader through the table function

This is useful when you want to implement `ATTACH` on a delta tables:

The `GetScanFunction` for the tableentry can then store additional information (for example a DeltaSnapshot object) in the `shared_ptr<TableFunctionInfo> TableFunction::function_info;` which the delta extension can then store in the multifilereader. This allows pinning a delta snapshot during a transaction.
