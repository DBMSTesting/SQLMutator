Title: Add delta to CI
Description:
This PR adds the delta extension to duckdb/duckdb CI.

I have skipped the linux builds for now meaning that this won't be available in nightlies on Linux platforms. The reason is that this CI jobs runs out of disk space. The proper solution to this is to refactor our extension CI to use the workflow from the [extension ci tools](https://github.com/duckdb/extension-ci-tools) allowing us to be a bit more flexible. However achieving this will require us to have reliable build caching, because otherwise we rebuild duckdb per extension which seems excessive. Alternatively we can consider the hacky way to just split the out of tree extensions in a part1 and part2 for now.
