Title: `json_extract` vs. `::` cast operator precedence
Description:
### What happens?

Casting a `JSON_EXTRACT` expression works only when put into explicit brackets although those brackets should not be necessary.

### To Reproduce

```sql
-- fails: No function matches the given name and argument types 'json_extract(JSON, DECIMAL(5,2))'
SELECT c1::JSON->'price'::decimal(5,2) j
    FROM VALUES('{ "price": 5 }') AS T(c1);    

-- works:
SELECT (c1::JSON->'price')::decimal(5,2) j
    FROM VALUES('{ "price": 5 }') AS T(c1);   
```

```
/*
┌──────┐
│ j    │
├──────┤
│ 5.00 │
└──────┘
*/
```
