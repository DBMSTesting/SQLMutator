Title: [Auto Loading] Autoload extension settings
Description:
This PR fixes #11404 

`TimeZone` is an `extension_setting` added by the ICU extension, so it's not available until the database has started.
When it's added to the config, it gets put into the `unrecognized_options` map.

After the database has initialized, we now look through the `unrecognized_options` to see if it contains settings we recognize as being part of a known extension and attempt to autoload them if possible.

### Running the added c++ test

Configuration:
`extension/extension_config_local.cmake`:
```
duckdb_extension_load(icu DONT_LINK)
```

Build:
`ENABLE_EXTENSION_AUTOLOADING=1 ENABLE_EXTENSION_AUTOINSTALL=1 make debug`

Run:
`LOCAL_EXTENSION_REPO=./build/debug/repository ./build/debug/test/unittest "Test autoload of extension settings"`
