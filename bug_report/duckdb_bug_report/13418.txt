Title: [Arrow] Support producing an "arrow_array_stream" PyCapsule
Description:
This PR implements #10716 

Through `DuckDBPyRelation.__arrow_c_stream__` we can now produce an `arrow_array_stream` PyCapsule.

Some things to note:
~~The ArrowArrayStream contains a `QueryResult`, if this is a `StreamQueryResult` and a new query is executed before the full stream has been exhausted the result will be invalidated and chunks can no longer be fetched from the stream anymore.~~

This currently produces a materialized result, meaning it *is* standalone from the connection and will not be affected by running other queries - but that does mean it doesn't support larger than memory result sets
