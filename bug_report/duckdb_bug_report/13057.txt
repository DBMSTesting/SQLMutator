Title: Only remove the first occurrence of extension prefix
Description:
An extension prefix is found when a given path is prefixed by some string followed by ':'. Then all occurrences of this prefix are removed from the path.

For instance, `ext:db` becomes `db`.
The problem is when we have `ext:myext:db`, the path will change to `mydb`, which is not an intended database name from the user.

To prevent this, this PR only removes the first occurrence of the extension prefix.
