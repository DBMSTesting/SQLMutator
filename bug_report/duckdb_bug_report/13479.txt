Title: Starting 0.10.3, duckdb can no longer query Arrow dataset, error claims it was created by "another Connection"
Description:
### What happens?

Prior to DuckDB 0.10.3, it was possible query a PyArrow dataset (presumably, via a DuckDBPyRelation).  As of 0.10.3 (and currently 1.0.0) this functionality no longer works.  Even though no "other connections" are apparently being used to create an object, the following error is generated.   

```
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: Python Object "ds" of type "DuckDBPyRelation" not suitable for replacement scan.
The object was created by another Connection and can therefore not be used by this Connection.
```

Could anyone explain what the issue is and how to resolve it so we can access the data?
It seems either the error is unclear, or perhaps incorrect (as prior versions of DuckDB handled this just fine.)

Thank you.

### To Reproduce

```
import duckdb
from deltalake import DeltaTable
from deltalake.writer import write_deltalake
import pandas as pd
import time

df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1,2,3,4,5], "asquared": [1,4,9,16,25]})
deltatable_name = str(time.time())
write_deltalake(deltatable_name, df)
ds = duckdb.arrow( DeltaTable(deltatable_name).to_pyarrow_dataset())
con = duckdb.connect()

print(con.execute("SELECT * FROM ds").df())
```
