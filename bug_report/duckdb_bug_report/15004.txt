Title: [pystubs] Fix type of `proto` parameter in `from_substrait` methods.
Description:
The generated signature for the two `from_substrait` methods make the `proto` parameter a `str`. However, if called with a value of that type, the following error is thrown:

```
TypeError: from_substrait(): incompatible function arguments. The following argument types are supported:
    1. (self: duckdb.duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection, proto: bytes) -> duckdb.duckdb.DuckDBPyRelation
```

This PR thus changes the type to `bytes` and adds a `stubgen` comment to document why.
