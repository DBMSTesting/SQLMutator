Title: DatabaseInstance's destructor: avoid throwing (and not cleaning up)
Description:
Simple test-case is:
```c++

int main() {
        duckdb::DatabaseInstance db;
	// db.Initialize not called
        return 1;
}
```
Where a not properly constructed DatabaseInstance will terminate the program before, and not afterwards.

There might be cases where (possibly due to exceptions) we get in a not fully initialized state, this avoids an exception that might not have a chance to be caught (and possibly might lead to failure).

Bumped into this by writing a test unit-test for a wrong PR, that had the unit-tester abort.
