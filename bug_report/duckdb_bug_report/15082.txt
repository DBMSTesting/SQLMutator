Title: Allow inputting a base hash in Regression workflow
Description:
Since #14973, our nightly no longer runs regressions against itself (always succeeding) but against the last successful nightly regression, now sometimes failing. This has caught a [CSV regression](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/12110544726/job/33761104729#step:17:228).

If we don't fix this regression, subsequent workflow runs will fail indefinitely. Sometimes, however, we want to accept regressions, for example, so the CSV reader can parse more timestamp types (at the cost of taking more time - at least, I think that's what's happening here). In such cases, we need to re-run the regression workflow against itself so that it succeeds.

This PR adds an input parameter to run the regression test against a specific DuckDB version. This would also allow us to run the current main against v.1.13.
