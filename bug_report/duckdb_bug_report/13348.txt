Title: Inconsistent cardinality estimates in EXPLAIN ANALYZE v.s. build/probe optimization
Description:
### What happens?

The cardinality estimates used in build/probe side optimization sometimes does not match those reported by EXPLAIN ANALYZE. 

### To Reproduce

Add these lines to `BuildProbeSideOptimizer::TryFlipJoinChildren` (remember to include iostream and use the std namespace) 

```
	cout << "left has estimate" << left_child->has_estimated_cardinality << endl;
	cout << "Left Cardinality: " << lhs_cardinality << endl;
	cout << "Left Side Build Cost: " << left_side_build_cost << endl;

	cout << "right has estimate" << right_child->has_estimated_cardinality << endl;
	cout << "Right Cardinality: " << rhs_cardinality << endl;
	cout << "Right Side Build Cost: " << right_side_build_cost << endl;
```

Add `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to benchmark/imdb_plan_cost/queries/02a.sql

Build with benchmark and extensions enabled: `BUILD_BENCHMARK=1 BUILD_HTTPFS=1 make -j4`

Enable the httpfs extension `build/release/duckdb -c "INSTALL 'build/release/extension/httpfs/httpfs.duckdb_extension';"`

Load data with `.read 'benchmark/imdb/init/load.sql'`

Run query with `.read 'benchmark/imdb_plan_cost/queries/02a.sql'`

DuckDB produces a right-deep plan, where the bottom join has estimated cardinality 4523930 according to EXPLAIN. However, the log from `BuildProbeSideOptimizer::TryFlipJoinChildren` reports a cardinality of 33 for that join (this is implied because the corresponding Right Cardinality is 2609129 from movie_companies).
