Title: using the read_parquet with union_by_name = true does not handle types.. should it?
Description:
### What happens?

Tried to load 2 parquet files via an array SELECT * FROM read_parquet(['transactions2.parquet', 'transactions1.parquet'], union_by_name = true);

throws an error like this: Error: Conversion Error: Could not convert string 'GB80TRWI23s123320' to INT128

I guess because both files are not cast to the same type for the matching named columns. Is there a way to combine the schemas before the load or fall back to a varchar if there is a missmatch of types.

### To Reproduce

Run a query like this with a few matching field names in the parquet with different types.
```
SELECT * FROM read_parquet(['transactions2.parquet', 'transactions1.parquet'], union_by_name = true);
```
