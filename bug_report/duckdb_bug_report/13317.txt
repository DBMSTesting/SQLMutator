Title: Bug/Regression fixes
Description:
Some issues piled up while I was on holiday, so I am slowly catching up.

Fixes 3 CTE-related issues:
1. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2569 - Materialized CTE prevented `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` to be converted to a TopN (bug was already there but was exposed by automatic CTE materialization)
2. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2571 - Already fixed by an earlier PR (#13024)
3. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2700 - Improved parallelization of CTE scans

And some other issues:
1. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2611 - NULL values weren't filtered out before inserting into join hash table, now they are
2. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2642 - Flush memory after grabbing the lock rather than before
3. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2652 - Properly deal with compressed empty JSON files

EDIT:

Bonus fix:
1. #13104

Just waiting for https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13321 to be merged so CI is happy again
