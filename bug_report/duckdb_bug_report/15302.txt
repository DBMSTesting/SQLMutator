Title: Queries using `SAMPLE` with `PERCENT` from file-based tables sometimes result in no data
Description:
### What happens?

Thank so much for the awesome stuff with this project - keep quacking!

When using DuckDB's `SAMPLE` SQL syntax with `PERCENT` I've noticed it sometimes produces no results. While I expect the results to be non-deterministic due to the feature that `SAMPLE` provides, what I'm seeing is that it sometimes produces no results when using simple datasets. My understanding is that this stems from a cluster sample approach by default (I haven't tried this with bernoulli sampling). When I attempt to use `ROWS` as an option instead things seem to work as expected. I tested this with both CSV and Parquet readers within DuckDB, which both exhibit the same behavior.

Specifically, if we have a table with one column and 5 values, numbers 1-5, and we query that table using `SAMPLE 50 PERCENT` I'd expect there to always be 2-3 rows returned. Instead what I noticed is that sometimes the return includes 0 results.

### To Reproduce

Please see this Google Colab notebook for a reproducible example of what I noticed: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RtHICbmDg5SnYGXLA2NgATHGVothx8IF . I also made a GitHub Gist as a backup, in case this is more helpful: https://gist.github.com/d33bs/7d9dab111574dc4e270e1df4a74fd45b .

Note: the behavior is relatively inconsistent so I use a loop of 10 iterations for each file type to demonstrate what I noticed.
