Title: Binder does not apply hive partition filtering
Description:
### What happens?

A filter on hive partition fields does not prevent non-matching files from being opened by the binder.

### To Reproduce

In the test suite:

```sql
select id, date 
from parquet_scan('data/parquet-testing/hive-partitioning/different_order/*/*/test.parquet', HIVE_PARTITIONING=1, HIVE_TYPES_AUTOCAST=0) 
where date = '2013-01-01';
```

This will open both files even though only one of them passes the filter. In my use case there are 873038 files but only 3 pass the filter, resulting in queries taking 35-75s.

Workaround:  If the filtering is pre-applied in Python to produce the list of 3 files, the runtime is reduced to 9s.
