Title: Add SUM(BOOL) overload
Description:
This is a useful overload that allows the user to quickly count the amount of matches for a boolean condition, it is essentially syntactic sugar for:

```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN [cond] THEN 1 END) FROM tbl
```

As an added bonus, it is also slightly faster than the above expression:

```sql
SELECT SUM(l_extendedprice > 500) FROM lineitem;
-- 0.020s
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN l_extendedprice > 500 THEN 1 END) FROM lineitem;
-- 0.028s
```
