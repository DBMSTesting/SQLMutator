Title: PySpark df.drop() to support expressions
Description:
- Adds support using more than one Column instance argument, i.e. as of now it’s only possible to use many str columns but onle one col(“mycol”).
- It also raises similar PySpark exception when column type is incorrect
- It also follows similar Apache PySpark API implementation logic.

NOTE: using `exclude.append(**str**(col.expr))` does not work as it relies on `ToString` method which adds extra quotas for simple column names like “name” I.e '"name"' which causes that column to be omitted from drop function. Hence exposing `GetName` of the `Expression`. It can also be useful in other places.
