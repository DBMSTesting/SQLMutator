Title: [Dev] Fix wrong result reported by Roaring Compression `FinalAnalyze`
Description:
The metadata size was being calculated for all the groups in the segment, but we were adding this to the total `space_used`
We know split the `space_used` into `data_size` and `metadata_size`.

`metadata_size` gets recalculated with every flushed container, whereas `data_size` is added onto for every container.
We make use of the new [logging](#15119) system to test this! ðŸ¥³
