Title: duckdb csv date parsing conflicts with auto-detection (do not guess that "41_10_1" is a date pattern).  
Description:
### What happens?

duckdb's default csv parsing fails to read this CSV:

```
"date","eventID","subplotID"
"2016-10-03","vst_OSBS_2016","41_10_1"
```

Because it guesses (incorrectly in this case) that subplotID is a date.  This throws a somewhat confusing error though, as duckdb does not fail until it tries to parse date, and it fails, complaining that the date format is wrong.  


Now yes yes I know the answer to CSV type-casting woes is always "specify all types of all columns manually" and yes we can do that and it works.  But I have yet to find another autoparser that fails on this particular case.  In my opinion, this is a bug of an overzealous guessing of things that look like dates.  I don't think `41_10_1` should be guessed as a date, and with the exception of spreadsheet software I haven't seen a program guess that is a date.  

The edge case of data with dates in two different formats will always fail with the auto-parsing, and I think in such cases it is fair to say the user needs to specify the types and not rely on guessing. but here, I think the guessing rule ought to be adjusted.  

I believe this issue first appears in duckdb 1.0, previous versions (e.g. 0.10.0) seem to parse this without issue.  

p.s. thanks for all duckdb does for the open-source community, it's truly revolutionary!
