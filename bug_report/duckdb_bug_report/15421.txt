Title: 15128: failed to bind column reference for function under unnest.
Description:
fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15128

Logical Unnest has interesting column binding behavior. The untested columns get the logical unnest table index, while the other columns pass through. This causes errors in the join order optimizer when filters are extracted, as only the unnest index was used in the table index -> relation idx mapping.
