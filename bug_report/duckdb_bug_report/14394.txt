Title: Tidy Check to do complete run also on feature
Description:
Connected to conversation at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14384#issuecomment-2416199641.

Basically logic after the PR will be as follow:

on `main` or `feature`: do complete check
else: do check only the diff.

Note that feature is not triggered automatically (not even on nightly), so this will have no difference as is, but allows this to be triggered manually and check the results.

Independently to be reviewed what should run on nightly.
