Title: Could not convert object (DICT) to the desired target type (STRUCT()) in an UDF
Description:
### What happens?

I try to make an UDF that returns a dict, however duckdb fails to retrieve and convert that dict to a struct.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb
from duckdb.typing import *

con = duckdb.connect('test')
def return_dict():
    return {
    1: "one",
    "2": 2,
    "three": [1, 2, 3],
    False: True
}

con.create_function("return_dict", return_dict, [], dict())
```

Then I try to retrieve the dict:

```python
con.sql("SELECT return_dict()").fetchall()
```
```
InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: We could not convert the object {1: 'one', '2': 2, 'three': [1, 2, 3], False: True} to the desired target type (STRUCT())
```
