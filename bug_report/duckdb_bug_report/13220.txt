Title: Filter paths before scripts/clang-tidy-diff.py
Description:
I am not super happy, since this doubles the paths between what needs to be specified at the CMake level and here. But it's likely fine for now. Unsure if there is a cleaner solution.

This fixes cases like https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/10176506561/job/28146061153?pr=13203#step:7:73 where a failure is detected even though the touched files should be filtered out.

Equivalent run after with this changes in: https://github.com/carlopi/duckdb/actions/runs/10177417419/job/28148945803 (now some files are checked while files in the `test/` `benchmark/` `src/common/adbc/` and `src/main/capi` are filtered out).
