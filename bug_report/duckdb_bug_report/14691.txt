Title: INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 3 within vector of size 3
Description:
### What happens?

Running this query:
```
select * from 'SecuritiesOrganizationsMapping__UPDATES.parquet' limit 10;
```
Produces:
```
INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 3 within vector of size 3
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```
I'm able to see the file with the "Parquet Floor v5.0.1" utility.
