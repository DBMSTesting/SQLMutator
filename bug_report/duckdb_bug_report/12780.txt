Title: [Dev] Make`Executor::ResultCollectorIsBlocked` less trigger-happy
Description:
Fixes an issue caused by #12636 

We have a CI run that generically blocks any Sink operation, this also makes the non-streaming result collector block, which is unexpected.
To account for this, we make sure that `ResultCollectorIsBlocked` only returns true if the result collector is a streaming result collector.
