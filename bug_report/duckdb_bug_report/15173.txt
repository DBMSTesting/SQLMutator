Title: Multiple in-memory duckdb instances clash when writing to temp directory
Description:
### What happens?

Multiple in-memory duckdb instances clash when writing to the temp-directory, no matter the client.
This could be avoided by setting the temp directory manually, but I wonder whether duckdb could either create sub-directories or unique filenames to avoid this automatically.  

### To Reproduce

Run the following snippet in two separate Terminal or Python duckdb instances at roughly the same time.

```sql
SET memory_limit='1GB';
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE df AS (SELECT random() FROM range(1_000_000_000));
SELECT * FROM df ORDER BY "random()";
```
One of them crashes with
```
IO Error: Could not read enough bytes from file ".tmp/duckdb_temp_storage-1.tmp": attempted to read 262144 bytes from location 818675712
```
