Title: COALESCE with aggregate function in PIVOT query does not work
Description:
### What happens?

In pivot we cannot use COALESCE over aggregate function, for example something like 
```
PIVOT Cities
ON Year
USING COALESCE(sum(Population), 0);
```
fails with 
```
Binder Error: Pivot expression must be an aggregate
```
It would be great to support it as some combination of `Year` and `Cities` might not be present in the source data so just ` USING sum(COALESCE(Population, 0))` does not solve the issue. May be related issue - https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14481

### To Reproduce

```
CREATE TABLE Cities (
    Country VARCHAR, Name VARCHAR, Year INTEGER, Population INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES
    ('NL', 'Amsterdam', 2000, 1005),
    ('NL', 'Amsterdam', 2010, 1065),
    ('NL', 'Amsterdam', 2020, 1158),
    ('US', 'Seattle', 2000, 564),
    ('US', 'Seattle', 2010, 608),
    ('US', 'Seattle', 2020, 738),
    ('US', 'New York City', 2000, 8015);
```
Then run 
```
 PIVOT Cities
    ON Year
    USING COALESCE(sum(Population), 0);
```
