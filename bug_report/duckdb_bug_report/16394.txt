Title: Fuzzer Fix: Fix Avg for NULL cast to TIMESTAMP
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-fuzzer/issues/3990

Fix (I think) Is to not use the DivModPositive Function as it assumes the LHS is positive. However, it seems like when NULL is cast to `Timestamp` a negative timestamp/hugeint_t value is used. 

Another fix may be a different timestamp value when casting NULL.

Commit causing the error was [1e404813c9ec1ebe47e4d1b4dccfd86ad978ba7d](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/commit/1e404813c9ec1ebe47e4d1b4dccfd86ad978ba7d).
