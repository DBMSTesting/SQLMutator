Title: Issue when binding nested macros that contain the same column names
Description:
### What happens?

A working (though naive) program for finding a maximal palindromic
subsequence using DuckDB v1.1.0 (fa5c2fe) is given below.

The problem is that when the triply-nested SELECT in
maximal_palindrome() is changed to a simpler form (see
simpler_maximal_palindrome()) the result is wrong, even though the
simplification should evidently have no effect.

Here's the result of the query shown below:
```
┌─────────┬────────────────────────────┬───────────┐
│    s    │ maximal_palindromic_subseq │ erroneous │
│ varchar │          varchar           │  varchar  │
├─────────┼────────────────────────────┼───────────┤
│ babaccd │ bab                        │ d         │
└─────────┴────────────────────────────┴───────────┘
```



### To Reproduce

```
create or replace function is_palindrome(s) as (
  with nt as (select length(s) as n)
  select not exists
    (SELECT i
     FROM (select n, unnest(range(1, n+1 // 2)) as i from nt)
     WHERE substr(s,i,1) != substr(s, 1 + n - i,1) )
);

# Longest palindrome starting at 1
create or replace function max_palindrome(s) as (
  select max_by(sub,i)
  from ( SELECT i, substr(s, 1, i) as sub
         FROM range(1, length(s)+1) t(i) 
         WHERE is_palindrome(sub) )
);

# A maximal palindrome within s
create or replace function maximal_palindrome(s) as (
  select max_by(p, length(p))
  from ( SELECT max_palindrome(sub) as p
         FROM (SELECT substr(s, i) as sub
               FROM range(1, length(s)) t(i) ))
);

# Variant version that produces incorrect results e.g. in v1.1.0 fa5c2fe
create or replace function simpler_maximal_palindrome(s) as (
  select max_by(p, length(p))
  from (SELECT max_palindrome(substr(s, i)) as p
        FROM range(1, length(s)) t(i) )
);

# Example
select s,
  maximal_palindrome(s) as maximal_palindromic_subseq,
  simpler_maximal_palindrome(s) as erroneous
from (select 'babaccd' as s);
```
