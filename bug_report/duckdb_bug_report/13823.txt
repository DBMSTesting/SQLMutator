Title: [Dev] Remove unnecessary parameter from BufferHandle constructor
Description:
Just something I noticed while working on something related to the buffer manager.

BufferHandle takes a BlockHandle and a FileBuffer pointer, but it's a raw pointer so unless the lifetime is guaranteed by an outside scope, providing anything other than the `handle->buffer.get()` can cause a heap use after free issue.

Tracing back the lineage, this originates from an age before we had `BlockHandle`: https://github.com/Mytherin/duckdb/commit/7251a5537934e91408c4b78863442b35ee1671e9#diff-bf94710a9036c38ee30044ac99f5752dc2bddfda44cd3f82992d992501f3d956
