Title: Allocator bulk deallocation flush threshold
Description:
When we are close to the memory limit and request a large allocation, e.g., for a hash table, we evict and deallocate many small blocks. It may take some time before all of this memory is actually returned to the OS because allocators like jemalloc will keep the memory around for a while. This will cause our RSS to go over the memory limit once we do the large allocation.

This PR implements a threshold parameter that, if the bulk deallocation is larger than the threshold, causes us to flush outstanding unused allocations before such large allocations are actually performed.
