Title: Return an error when multiple rows are returned from a scalar subquery
Description:
Implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11521
Implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13469

This PR modifies the behavior of scalar subqueries so that an error is thrown when multiple rows are returned, instead of returning a random row. This aligns the behavior of the system with that of Postgres, instead of that of SQLite.

For example:

```sql
select (select unnest(range(10)));
-- Invalid Input Error: More than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression - scalar subqueries can only return a single row.
```

The old behavior is available through the `scalar_subquery_error_on_multiple_rows`  configuration setting:

```sql
SET scalar_subquery_error_on_multiple_rows=false;
D select (select unnest(range(10))) as result;
┌────────┐
│ result │
│ int64  │
├────────┤
│      0 │
└────────┘
```
