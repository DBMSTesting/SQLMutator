Title: [Python Dev] Fix crash with empty args for `isin` | Fix transformation for `isnotin`
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/16265

While I was at it, I realized that `isnotin` doesn't transform correctly, it should use `ExpressionType::COMPARE_NOT_IN`, not just wrap the `COMPARE_IN` result with an `OPERATOR_NOT`

I wonder if the optimizer catches this and made this change already, or it doesn't because the behavior is not equivalent for the two cases - either way, better to fix it here.
