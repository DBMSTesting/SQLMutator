Title: Alias in column used in GROUP BY leads to different behavior if alias is also a table column
Description:
### What happens?

I consider a SQL with aliases. And consider the situation where an alias is later added as column in the table: this turns functional query to failing query.

(This is in the context of SQL generated programmatically with JooQ in https://github.com/solven-eu/adhoc).

(This is a simplistic scenario, reflecting a real scenario, in which the alias is used to solve ambiguities between same-name columns from multiple JOINs. I try using given alias in the `GROUP BY`, but it fails with a binder issue as the alias `someColumn` is ambiguous to multiple joined table `join1.someColumn`, `join2.someColumn`).

### To Reproduce

```
create or replace table t1 (k1 VARCHAR);
SELECT COUNT(*) , "k1" "k2" FROM t1 GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (("k2"));
```
For any reason, `k1` is aliased `k2` and this alias is used in groupSet: this query is OK


Later, I consider the same table but with a `k2` column
```
create or replace table t2 (k1 VARCHAR, k2 VARCHAR);
SELECT COUNT(*) , "k1" "k2" FROM t2 GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (("k2"));
```

It fails with a binder issue:
```
Binder Error: column "k1" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or must be part of an aggregate function.
Either add it to the GROUP BY list, or use "ANY_VALUE(k1)" if the exact value of "k1" is not important.
LINE 1: SELECT COUNT(*) , "k1" "k2" FROM t GROUP BY GROUPING SETS...
```

I tried re-stating the alias in the `GROUP BY`, but it failed:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) , "k1" "k2" FROM t GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (("k1" "k2"));

Parser Error: syntax error at or near ""k2""
LINE 1: ..." FROM t GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (("k1" "k2"));
```

Is something wrong in DuckDB, or with my query? (In this is my query, I should find answers elsewhere, but I would be find getting feedback about what I'm doing wrong).

Side-question: Is `AS` mandatory to define aliases? The documentation suggests that yes, but queries without `AS` looks working fine.
