Title: Not using Random Device in DuckDB Core
Description:
Random Device has different interfaces and libc++ and in libstdc++, this can cause symbol collisions with other libraries.
This PR removes the usage of random device and checks the symbols are not exported in CI.
It is most likely necessary to also amend extensions that might use and export this symbol.
