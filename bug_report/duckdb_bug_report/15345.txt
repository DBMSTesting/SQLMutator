Title: length of lpad result off-by-one when padding a regexp_replace match variable 
Description:
### What happens?

I beleive the value of pad1 and pad2 should be the same in this result, but they are not.


### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT
    'A' || lpad('9', 2, '0') AS pad1,
    regexp_replace('A9', '(A)(\d+)', '\1' || lpad('\2', 2, '0')) AS pad2,
;
```
```
pad1,pad2
A09,A9
```
