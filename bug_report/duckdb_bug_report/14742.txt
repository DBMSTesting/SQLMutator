Title: Detect catalog changes on DROP IF EXISTS
Description:
Fixes a bug where prepared statements of DROP IF EXISTS could run into an `INTERNAL Error: Attempting to commit a transaction that is read-only but has made changes - this should not be possible`. The problem is that in case the table does not exist during bind, the catalog access is not even registered as catalog READ access, and hence catalog change detection cannot kick in (triggering rebind).
