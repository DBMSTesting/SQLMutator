Title: Correlated subquery related? Failed to bind column reference "once_state2" [35.0] (bindings: {#[1.0], #[33.0]})
Description:
### What happens?

See the reproduction. The difference between the first query that succeeds, and the second that gives an error is only that a column is referenced in the where clause in the second query. This column is generated from a exists correlated subquery "self join".

### To Reproduce

```
$ ./duckdb 
v1.0.0 1f98600c2c
```
```sql
select version();
```
```text
┌───────────┐
│ version() │
│  varchar  │
├───────────┤
│ v1.0.0    │
└───────────┘
```
```sql
create table stuff (
      ts timestamp,
      item_id int,
      type text
    );
```
```sql
with
    unique_items as (
       select distinct item_id from stuff
    ),
    state_stuff as (
      select
        item_id,
        exists (select 1 from stuff c where s.item_id = c.item_id
                and type = 'state1') as once_state1,
        exists (select 1 from stuff c where s.item_id = c.item_id
                and type = 'state2') as once_state2
      from unique_items s)
    select * from state_stuff;
```
```text
┌─────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ item_id │ once_state1 │ once_state2 │
│  int32  │   boolean   │   boolean   │
├─────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┤
│               0 rows                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
```sql
with
    unique_items as (
       select distinct item_id from stuff
    ),
    state_stuff as (
      select
        item_id,
        exists (select 1 from stuff c where s.item_id = c.item_id
                and type = 'state1') as once_state1,
        exists (select 1 from stuff c where s.item_id = c.item_id
                and type = 'state2') as once_state2
      from unique_items s)
    select * from state_stuff where not once_state2;
```
```console
INTERNAL Error: Failed to bind column reference "once_state2" [35.0] (bindings: {#[1.0], #[33.0]})
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
