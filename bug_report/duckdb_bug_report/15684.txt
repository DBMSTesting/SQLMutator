Title: Implement `parquet_version` parameter for Parquet writer
Description:
We have added `DELTA_BINARY_PACKED`, `DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY`, and `BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT` for the Parquet writer since v1.1, but we won't write these encodings by default, _because some systems still can't read these_. Instead, these can be opted into using `parquet_version='V2'`. This parameter currently defaults to `'V1'`.

I'd be happy to receive some feedback (I'm also not 100% sure about the parameter's name).

EDIT: I've renamed this to `parquet_version` instead.
