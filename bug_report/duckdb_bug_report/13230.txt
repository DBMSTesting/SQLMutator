Title: Fix #13200: Transactions that update tables need to keep the underlying row group collection alive to ensure we can safely clean-up
Description:
Fixes #13200 

Clean-up of transactions with updates is postponed as other transactions can still rely on the old values that are present in the update segments. This clean-up could run into problems if another transaction would drop the table in the mean-time. In order to ensure the clean-up can safely proceed, we keep a reference to the row group collection for any transaction that does an update.
