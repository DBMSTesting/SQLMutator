Title: subtype DBInterface.Connection in julia client
Description:
By subtyping the `DBInterface.Connection` type from the julia DBInterface package we gain access to a series of additional methods, in particular the `do block` syntax to automatically close the cursor after the closure in the do block is executed.

I imagine not having this was an oversight as `DuckDB.DB` (unlike `DuckDB.Connection`) was already a subtype of `DBInterface.Connection`.
