Title: Duckdb fails to load json files in windows that are open in another app
Description:
### What happens?

Using the duckdb command line of JDBC driver you can't load files that are open (locked) by another application. This is mainly a problem on Windows as it likes to lock files.

IO Error: Cannot open file "P:\2025-01-09_Log.json": The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

Is it possible so the code tries to open the file without gaining a lock on it, so that it can be read. I'm happy to accept that the data could change while it's being read, but with the ignore_errors=true

### To Reproduce

This powershell creates a file, opens it for writing, then tries to read it.

```powershell
$path = "$($ENV:HOMEPATH)\Downloads\t.json"
Write-Output '{}' > $path
$file = [System.IO.File]::Open($path, "Open", "Write", "None")
duckdb -c "select count(*) from read_json('${path}')";
$file.close()
 ;

````
