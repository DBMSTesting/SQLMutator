Title: Label mark joins with convert to semi
Description:
Continuation of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12828/files
closes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11042

The discussion on PR 12828, led to making a new optimizer to prevent mark to semi join conversions.  Although the chance is very small, I was worried people could turn off the NO_MARK_TO_SEMI_OPTIMIZER but not the filter pushdown optimizer. This would mean the bug could persist if another optimizer was added to fix this. 

Now in optimizer.cpp, once the filter pushdown object is created, `filter_pushdown.CheckMarkToSemi(*plan, top_bindings);` is called. This is only needs to be called at the root of the plan, keeping the code clean and avoiding extra tree traversals.
