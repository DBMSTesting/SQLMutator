Title: DESCRIBE and query_table can't work together
Description:
### What happens?

I want to write a MACRO that describes any table

### To Reproduce

First, that strange difference:
```
CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT 42 AS i, 84 AS j;

DESCRIBE query_table(t1) ; -- Parser Error: syntax error at or near "("

DESCRIBE FROM query_table(t1) ; -- OK
```

Then with a macro:
```
CREATE OR replace MACRO describe_table(table_name) AS TABLE (
	FROM (DESCRIBE FROM query_table(table_name))
) ;
   
FROM describe_table(t1) ; -- `Error: Table with name table_name does not exist!`
```
