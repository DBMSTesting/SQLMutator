Title: Make `ErrorData::Message()` and `ErrorData::RawMessage()` const
Description:
I was writing a few functions the other day that take an `ErrorData` object as argument and call its `Message()` method. I wanted to make the`ErrorData` argument `const`, but this didn't work because `Message()` is not a const method, even though it does not change the visible state of the object. This is because it changes the private member [`final_message`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/cc2dc1d6d4b29b1b20c94e70061de2f441b794a1/src/include/duckdb/common/error_data.hpp#L64).

Since `final_message` is some internal state used for lazy evaluation and changing this field does not affect the logical "constness" of the object, I propose to mark this member as `mutable` and make `RawMessage()`/`Message()` const methods.
