Title: Json path
Description:
### What happens?

When creating a table with a JSON column and inserting JSON data into it, the query to extract a specific element from a JSON array works correctly when selecting the entire object. However, when trying to extract a specific property (e.g., `Id`) from an object within a JSON array, the query returns no result. This behavior suggests that the JSON path does not support retrieving information directly from an array and requires an object instead. The question is whether this behavior is normal.

### To Reproduce

When I create a table as follows:
```sql
CREATE TABLE example (j JSON);
INSERT INTO example VALUES ('[{"Id":"0001","Name":"Name1"},{"Id":"0002","Name":"Name2"}]');
```
and I run the following command:
```sql
SELECT j->>'$[0]' FROM example;
```
I get the following result and everything is OK.
```
{"Id":"0001","Name":"BLE TENDRE"}
```
When I run the same query requesting the Id:
```sql
SELECT j->>'$[0].Id' FROM example;
```
I get no return. The JSON path does not allow retrieving information from an array, it requires an object. 
Is this normal?
