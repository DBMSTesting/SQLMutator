Title: pybind11>=2.6.0 Insufficient – Update tools/pythonpkg/requirements-dev.txt
Description:
### What happens?

The _tools/pythonpkg/requirements-dev.txt_ file needs to be updated, as pybind11>=2.6.0 is insufficient.

I have the following installed:

```
pybind11-devel-2.6.2-4.el9.x86_64
python3-pybind11-2.6.2-4.el9.x86_64
```

However, the build fails with the following error:
```
/builddir/build/BUILD/duckdb-1.1.3/tools/pythonpkg/src/include/duckdb_python/python_objects.hpp:237:48: error: ‘const_name’ was not declared in this scope
  237 |         static constexpr auto name = const_name("typing.Optional[") + concat(make_caster<T>::name) + const_name("]");
      |                                      ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |                                                                                                      ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~
```


The commit https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/commit/39fbc7992b28188aac6bbcfa7d7814b217f54674#diff-08367c43787b430e7db8cbe20060c3a5c1c2d14e31726475a779d9940efcc075
indicates that const_name was introduced after [v2.9.0](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

It remains unclear whether v2.9.0 is fully sufficient to resolve this issue.
