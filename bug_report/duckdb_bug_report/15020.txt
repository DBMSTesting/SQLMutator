Title: `rowid` filter pushdown
Description:
This PR adds support for pushing down static and dynamic filters on the `rowid` column into table scans.

The rowid column is not a real stored column and doesn't have statistics, but since row-ids are sequential within a row group we can always trivially create fake statistics on-the-fly to feed to the table filters. We also create dummy stats and filter for each vector when doing a partial scan of a row-group in order to avoid materializing the row-ids and actually evaluate the filter expression fully when there are no matches.

This opens up new possibilities for query-rewrites and optimizations.

## Benchmarks:

Here are some microbenchmarks, all run on **TPC-H sf=10**

### Static Filter Pushdown

This benchmark just does a point-lookup, with or without the filter pushdown optimizer enabled.

```sql
CALL dbgen(sf=10);
SELECT * FROM lineitem where rowid = 500;
```

**Results**:

Without rowid pushdown:
```

benchmark/micro/pushdown/rowid_no_pushdown.benchmark    5       0.292097
```

With rowid pushdown:
```

benchmark/micro/pushdown/rowid_pushdown.benchmark       5       0.000428
```

### Dynamic Filter Pushdown

Here we're rewriting a Top-N style query to instead produce a dynamic filter on the rowid as a result of the comparison join produced by the IN clause. In the future we may want to rewrite this query automatically to benefit from this optimization when a lot of columns are returned. 

```sql
-- The "naive" Top-N
SELECT * FROM lineitem ORDER BY l_orderkey DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Is equivalent to this rewritten query:
SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE rowid IN (SELECT rowid FROM lineitem ORDER BY l_orderkey DESC LIMIT 5);

``` 

**Results**:

Naive Top-N
