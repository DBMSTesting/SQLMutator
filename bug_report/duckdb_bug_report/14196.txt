Title: [Export/Import] Use the DependencyManager to (stable) sort the entries before export
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3050
This PR is a revival of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/10677

We use GetNaiveExportOrder as we already do, but now we use `DependencyManager::ReorderEntries` to make sure a dependent entry gets exported first if the dependency manager is aware that there is a dependency on the entry.
