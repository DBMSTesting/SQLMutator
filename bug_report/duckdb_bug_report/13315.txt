Title: Fix CMake for when folders are not git folders via `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`
Description:
More polished version of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13314.

2 fixes: passing down the proper WORKING_DIR and check ERROR code to decide whether a folder is a GIT folder or not.

I tested this locally, CI here should mostly test that no regressions are introduced.

This PR makes so that when `git` is available BUT a given folder is downloaded without setting up git repository it should still work (but with an empty EXTENSION_VERSION.
