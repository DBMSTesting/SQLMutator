Title: Re-enable azure out of tree extension
Description:
This used to fail very frequently with a download problem on libxml2, this might have been solved either by bumping to a more recent VCPKG or due to libxml2 or possibly different settings in the gnome.gitlab repository.

This reverts https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15126.

I am not sure if problems have actually went away, I am triggering a bunch of different tests, lets see.
