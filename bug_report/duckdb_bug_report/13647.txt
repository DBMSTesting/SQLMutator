Title: [Fix] list_reduce and list_resize fixes
Description:
This fixes three issues.

- `list_resize` failed due to a `NULL` row and a `new_size > 0`: we did not resize the child vector.
- `list_reduce` failed due to a `NULL STRUCT`: we did not set the child vectors to invalid.
- `list_reduce` failed due to repeated references in the loop: we would not persist beyond two iterations.
