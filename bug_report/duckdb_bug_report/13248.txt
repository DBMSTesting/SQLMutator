Title: S3 to HTTP path conversion when writing to AWS S3 in Gov Cloud
Description:
### What happens?

I believe your S3 path to HTTP path conversion is incorrect for AWS Gov Cloud.  I am trying to write duckdb tables out to parquet files in S3. Here is a snippit of what I'm doing:

```
# Initialize an in-memory DuckDB connection
conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
conn.execute("INSTALL aws;LOAD aws;")
conn.execute("INSTALL httpfs;LOAD httpfs;")
conn.execute("CALL load_aws_credentials();")
...
...
...
# Write the duckdb table to S3 as parquet
file_name = f's3://{s3_bucket}/data/{table_name}/{table_name}.parquet'
conn.execute(f"COPY {table_name} TO '{file_name}' (FORMAT 'parquet')")
```


The error occurs on execute:
```
self.conn.execute(f"COPY {table_name} TO '{file_name}' (FORMAT 'parquet')")
duckdb.duckdb.HTTPException: HTTP Error: Unable to connect to URL "https://{bucket...}.s3.amazonaws.com/data/encounters/encounters.parquet": 400 (Bad Request)
```

That HTTP path above is correct and runs in AWS Commercial.  However, when I run this in AWS Gov cloud it fails with that error above because the paths for gov cloud should look like:
https://{bucket...}.s3.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com/

the url slug "us-gov-east-1" is missing in your s3 to http path ranslation for s3 paths into gov cloud accounts.




### To Reproduce


```
# Initialize an in-memory DuckDB connection
conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
conn.execute("INSTALL aws;LOAD aws;")
conn.execute("INSTALL httpfs;LOAD httpfs;")
conn.execute("CALL load_aws_credentials();")
...
... (make some generic table here)
...
# Write the duckdb table to S3 as parquet
file_name = f's3://{s3_bucket}/data/{table_name}/{table_name}.parquet'
conn.execute(f"COPY {table_name} TO '{file_name}' (FORMAT 'parquet')")
```
