Title: Fix issue copying a TABLE that references a SEQUENCE
Description:
This PR fixes #14639

Using `nextval('seq')` was finding the original sequence entry in both the `from` and `to` database.
We are now inserting the catalog+schema of the table in the search path when binding the `nextval`, so it finds the right sequence (the one that was just created)

- `dependency` was removed from ScalarFunction, in favor of `bind_with_binder`, this receives a Binder instead of a ClientContext, we can use the binder to propagate the dependency information directly.
- `bind_extended` can be given instead of `bind` to receive a `ScalarFunctionBindInput` instead of a `ClientContext &`, this should be used if the function has to look up catalog entries (such as `currval` and `nextval`)
