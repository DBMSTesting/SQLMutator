Title: [Postgres Compatiblity] Support `=>` to supply named parameters to functions
Description:
Similar to our own `<name> := <expression>`, Postgres uses a variation of this: `<name> => <expression>` which is required to provide values for named parameters.
With this PR we now support both, this works for both scalar functions and table functions.
