Title: Don't decode special characters on redirect
Description:
This PR start with a small increment to extend decoding_url function to accept a set of characters that should be excluded when decoding the URL.

Given the times it's invoked a set should be fine, unless we want ultra optimization in that particular function.

The functionality just ignore '/' after decoding if it's a PATH component DURING redirects. 
Ideally, this can be reused when other parts of the code suffer from the same issue...

A test can be added, but given the URL mentioned in the issue is external and not owned by this repo, it may cause failures in the future.

Info
----------------------

The RFC says that certain characters (mostly reserved) that may interfere with the section shouldn't be decoded. 


From: https://www.urldecoder.org/
```
The reserved character "/", for example, if used in the "path" component of a URI, has the special meaning of being a delimiter between path segments. If, according to a given URI scheme, "/" needs to be in a path segment, then the three characters "%2F" (or "%2f") must be used in the segment instead of a "/".
```

From RFC: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1

```
A subset of the reserved characters (gen-delims) is used as
   delimiters of the generic URI components described in [Section 3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3).  A
   component's ABNF syntax rule will not use the reserved or gen-delims
   rule names directly; instead, each syntax rule lists the characters
   allowed within that component (i.e., not delimiting it), and any of
   those characters that are also in the reserved set are "reserved" for
   use as subcomponent delimiters within the component.  Only the most
   common subcomponents are defined by this specification; other
   subcomponents may be defined by a URI scheme's specification, or by
   the implementation-specific syntax of a URI's dereferencing
   algorithm, provided that such subcomponents are delimited by
   characters in the reserved set allowed within that component.
```


Closes: #14819
