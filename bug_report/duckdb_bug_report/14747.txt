Title: Add JSON Logical Type metadata to parquet writer
Description:
### Summary of Change
This simply changes the parquet extension to write `JsonType()` to the LogicalType metadata field. Without it, the parquet files that DuckDB generates cannot be used with Redshift in conjunction with [`COPY FROM... SERIALIZETOJSON ` SQL to load JSON columns into super columns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/ingest-super.html). I wouldn't be surprised if there are other parquet readers that will misinterpret the type without that metadata.
