Title: Allow databases with table_macros to be copyable via COPY FROM DATABASE
Description:
Apparently handling looks to be the same for MACRO_ENTRY and TABLE_MACRO_ENTRY, and this seems to make copying works as expected.

Unsure if there are potential problems with this.
This was encounter looking at failures in Cross Version test where a bunch of `Not implemented Error: Entry type Table Macro Function not supported in PhysicalCopyDatabase` are reported.

After this PR they all seems to work as intended.
