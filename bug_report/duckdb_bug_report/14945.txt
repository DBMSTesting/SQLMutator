Title: remove failing benchmark 
Description:
This PR removes a mention of the `benchmark/realnest/17_list_aggregates_histogram_stddev_mode.benchmark` from the `realnest.csv` file, because the query sporadically caused failure of the `Regression` workflow.

This is a temporary solution for issue https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3409.
