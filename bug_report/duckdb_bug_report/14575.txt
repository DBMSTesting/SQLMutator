Title: `alias(A) as new_alias_A` returns `new_alias_A` rather than `A`
Description:
### What happens?

It's possible this is not a bug, but if it isn't, it _does_ break my understanding of expression trees and select list aliases. 

Running

```
with x as (select 1 as A union all select 2 as A)
from x select alias(A);
```

Gives me rows with A as the value. But running

```
with x as (select 1 as A union all select 2 as A)
from x select alias(A) as new_alias_A;
```

Gives me rows with value `new_alias_A`. 

Is that right? It seems like the second query should return rows w/ `A`, since that is the value I expect from the expression `alias(A)`, while `new_alias_A` would be the column alias.
