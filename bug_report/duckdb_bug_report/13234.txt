Title: Add `CUMULATIVE_CARDINALITY` metric
Description:
This PR adds the `CUMULATIVE_CARDINALITY` metric, and also reworks the way metrics are stored internally. Whereas they previously were stored in a `struct`, they are now in an `unordered_map` of `Values`. This allows for the use of more agnostic functions and also allows for better integration in the C API in the future.
