Title: [Dev] Uncouple `HTTPState` from core
Description:
The `HTTPState` predates the existence of `ClientContextState`.

When the ClientContextState was introduced the HTTPState was properly reworked to derive from it, but it still lives in core.
This PR moves it to the `httpfs` extension where it belongs.

To untangle the last bit of coupling with core, we introduce `ClientContextState::WriteProfilingInformation` which is used in `QueryProfiler::QueryTreeToStream`.

This is where the HTTPState adds the `HTTP Stats` to the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output.
