Title: docs: tweak explanation of median for even cardinality inputs
Description:
Instead of qualitative/quantitative, I think we should be more direct and list the actual types.

Also, just a little more word-smithing to be explicit that we are only referring to the two middle values. This change I am less convinced is a good idea, but I still think it's a positive.
