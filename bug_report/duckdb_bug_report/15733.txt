Title: Make entries field non-nullable for Arrow map type
Description:
`SetArrowMapFormat` in the `ArrowConverter` would produce a schema where the nullability of the `entries` field is set to Nullable. This is actually not correct.

Without this fix the arrow produced by DuckDB causes problems when I try to feed it to the Delta Kernel, which uses arrow rust to decode our schema and then complains about this nullability being incorrect.
