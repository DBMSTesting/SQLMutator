Title: INTERNAL Error when client_context.GetCurrentQuery() is called in an optimizer extension
Description:
### What happens?

An internal error is raised when client_context.GetCurrentQuery() is called in an optimizer extension.

Raising an issue here based on discussion on discord.

A minimal repro can be found here: https://github.com/juja0/current_query_error

Note: This works without issue when executed via tests, so it could be related to the absence of an active transaction in the "prepare" stage of query execution from cli.

3. Launch duckdb: "./build/debug/duckdb"
