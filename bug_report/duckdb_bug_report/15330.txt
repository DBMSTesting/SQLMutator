Title: Adjustments on test to bypass sniffing limitation on vector_size
Description:
Our dialect detection performs a more detailed inspection on the first vector of each dialect configuration.

This test fails to properly detect the `"` as a quote when `STANDARD_VECTOR_SIZE=2`.

We could force the dialect detection to process a fixed, and even configurable, number of tuples instead of relying on the vector size. However, this approach seems a bit excessive.
