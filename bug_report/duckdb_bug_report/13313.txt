Title: Implemented `list_extract` with `VectorOperations::Copy`
Description:
This PR changes the implementation of `list_extract` to use a selection vector combined with a call to `VectorOperations::Copy` instead of using a ad-hoc templated switch case that basically more or less reimplements copy anyway.

This has the benefit of reducing code duplication and bloat slightly, but the primary motivation to implement this was to enable support for extracting list-of-arrays, which was previously not possible. The initial attempt at supporting that ended up looking a lot like copy, which made me realize that it could be generalized for all types if we just used copy instead.
