Title: Enum type with no members
Description:
### What happens?

I'm not sure if an Enum type with no members is permitted by design or it is a bug but calling `enum_range` on such type causes an internal error.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ();

SELECT enum_range(NULL::mood) AS my_enum_range;
```
Results in: 
> INTERNAL Error: Value::LIST without providing a child-type requires a non-empty list of values. Use Value::LIST(child_type, list) instead.
