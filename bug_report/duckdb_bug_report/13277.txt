Title: Support HUGEINT in printf and format
Description:
Fix #10578 

The fmt library, by default, only supports `int128` on 64-bit platforms. I have modified it to use `hugeint_t` for `int128` for compatibility across all platforms.

I'm not sure if HUGEINT should be treated as integer in printf, I've asked in #13173 but nobody answered yet. I'll close this PR if it's not the intended behavior.
