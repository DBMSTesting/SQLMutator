Title: [BufferManager] Fix `duckdb_memory()` reporting wrong size for `temporary_storage_bytes`
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2805

`evicted_data_per_tag` gets increased in `WriteTemporaryBuffer`, but gets decreased in `ReadTemporaryBuffer`.
This meant that `evicted_data_per_tag` would never decrease if the temporary buffer was not read before it was destroyed.

This PR moves this logic to `DeleteTemporaryFile` which will happen both when the buffer is read (as it gets subsequently destroyed) and also when it is destroyed before reading.
