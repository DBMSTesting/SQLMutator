Title: Function strip_accents doesn't remove some diacritics
Description:
### What happens?

I have loaded forenames from [popular-names-by-country](https://github.com/sigpwned/popular-names-by-country-dataset?tab=readme-ov-file):

```sql
create table FORENAMES as
    select *
    from read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigpwned/popular-names-by-country-dataset/refs/heads/main/common-forenames-by-country.csv', header=true, normalize_names=true);
```

I needed to strip diacritics from data so I have used strip_accents.

``` sql
select romanized_name, strip_accents(romanized_name)  FORENAME_WITHOUT_ACCENTS, hex(romanized_name) HEXVALUE 
from FORENAMES 
where romanized_name = strip_accents(romanized_name)  
  and regexp_replace(romanized_name, '[A-Za-z0-9- '']+','','g') <>'';
```
and I got 
```
FORENAME  |FORENAME_WITHOUT_ACCENTS|HEXVALUE              
----------+------------------------+----------------------
