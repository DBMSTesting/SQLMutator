Title: Trying to read an empty compressed JSON file deadlocks
Description:
### What happens?

If you have two compressed NDJSON files. One empty, and the other non-empty. Attempting to load them deadlocks duckdb.

t1.json (empty):
```
```

t2.json:
```
{"id": 1, "name": "bob"}
{"id": 2, "name": "tom"}
```

```bash
gzip t1.json
gzip t2.json
```

### To Reproduce

```
SELECT * FROM read_ndjson_auto(['t1.json.gz', 't2.json.gz'])
```
