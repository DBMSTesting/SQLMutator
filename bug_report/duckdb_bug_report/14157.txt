Title: fix: ArrowSchemaMetadata::GetOption to return empty string instead of raising exception if key is not found.
Description:
This method was documented to return the empty string if the key was not found, but in actuality it was calling .at() on the unordered_map which raised an exception.  This PR fixes this behavior to return the empty string if the key is not found.
