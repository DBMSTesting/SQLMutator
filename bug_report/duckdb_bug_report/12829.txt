Title: Rebind prepared statements based on catalog versions
Description:
Changes the rebinding logic for prepared statements to be based on catalog versions. First, this gives us catalog versions, providing a simple and quick way to detect catalog changes. These catalog versions are then used to power change detection for rebinds of prepared statements.

The current mechanism for detecting rebinds of prepared statements was based on the global oid counter, which is incremented whenever a new CatalogEntry is created or modified (independently of what catalog it is created in, or whether that TX ends up being committed or not). The new mechanism is more fine-granular in detecting when rebinds are actually needed, based on the state of the catalog as it is to be used for the currently bound query.

A current limitation of the PR is that it does not detect changes done by system transactions. Further, in case of external databases (e.g. SQLite or MySQL), it will always rebind as they don't (currently) provide catalog versioning information.
