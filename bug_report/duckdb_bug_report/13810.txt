Title: Internal error with unnest and cross join
Description:
### What happens?

Internal error when running query with filter after UNNEST on cross join.

### To Reproduce

Minimal reproducible version of a query I was writing:

```sql
SELECT y + z AS c FROM (SELECT y, unnest([x]) AS z FROM (SELECT 1 as x), (SELECT 1 as y))
 WHERE c > 0;
```
Reports:
```text
INTERNAL Error: Failed to bind column reference "z" [20.0] (bindings: {#[8.0]})
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```

Omitting `WHERE c > 0` runs fine:
```sql
SELECT y + z AS c FROM (SELECT y, unnest([x]) AS z FROM (SELECT 1 as x), (SELECT 1 as y));
```
```text
┌───────┐
│   c   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     2 │
└───────┘
```

Also in case this is helpful as well, I discovered this when running through node (`{ library_version: 'v1.0.0', source_id: '1f98600c2c' }`) which logged this assertion error when it failed:
```
Assertion failed: (relation_manager.relation_mapping.find(colref.binding.table_index) != relation_manager.relation_mapping.end()), function GetColumnBinding, file query_graph_manager.cpp, line 48.
```

For context, in my actual query the `(SELECT 1 as x)` subquery is an aggregation producing one row and `(SELECT 1 as y)` is larger.
