Title: fix creating VARINT logical type in C API
Description:
See https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15669.

There was a missing case for VARINT in `ConvertCTypeToCPP`, which meant attempting to create a VARINT type through the C API (using `duckdb_create_logical_type(DUCKDB_TYPE_VARINT)`) instead returned a `duckdb_logical_type` with the type id `DUCKDB_TYPE_VARINT`.

Among other things, this meant attempting to create a data chunk with a VARINT column didn't work. That's what I was trying to do when I found this. I included two unit tests for this case, one for VARINT (which was previously broken) and one for BLOB (which was not).
