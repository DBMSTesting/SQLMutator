Title: Move FIRST/LAST/ANY_VALUE to use sort keys 
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12520

Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12480

Similar to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12525 - this PR reworks the first/last/any_value functions to move away from the CreateSortKeyHelpers. Similarly this improves performance and greatly reduces memory usage. Performance/memory improvements are very similar to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12525.
