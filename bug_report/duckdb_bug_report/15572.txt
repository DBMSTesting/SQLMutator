Title: Arithmetic between a date type and interval results in a timestamp 
Description:
### What happens?

The resulting type of an arithmetic operation between a date value and interval results in a timestamp type.

I can understand why this would be necessary in some cases, but it shouldn't be the default especially since the official docs don't follow this logic:

 I'd expect adding whole days to a date would result in another date type.

### To Reproduce

```SQL
WITH a_bunch_of_dates AS (
    SELECT
        -- Create a random date between 2020-01-01 and 2020-12-31
        -- We use DATE_TRUNC to truncate the date to JUST the day
        DATE_TRUNC('day', DATE '2020-01-01' + (FLOOR(RANDOM() * 365) || ' days')::INTERVAL) AS some_date
    FROM
        -- Generate 100 rows
        GENERATE_SERIES(1, 100)
),
main AS (
    SELECT
        some_date, -- The value before arithmetic, type is a date32
        some_date + INTERVAL '5 DAYS' AS now_a_timestamp -- The value after arithmetic, type is a timestamp
    FROM
        a_bunch_of_dates
)

SELECT
    some_date,
    now_a_timestamp
FROM
    main;
```

Running the above SQL statement you will see the type of some_date and now_a_timestamp are different.
