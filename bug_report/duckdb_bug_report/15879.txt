Title: [Linux CI] Remove examples, already tested as part of OSX Release
Description:
Fix problems such as https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/12940781324/job/36097710100, this is tested elsewhere, and doing this in the container is not worth (I think), since it adds unnecessary complexity.


I have also enabled the run on every PR, it's heavy (1h40) but it's a relevant codepath we want to test. After v1.2 we can revisit this.
