Title: Use steady clock for profiler
Description:
As documented in C++ STL [doc](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/steady_clock) for `steady_clock`:
```
This clock is not related to wall clock time (for example, it can be time since last reboot), and is most suitable 
for measuring intervals.
```
