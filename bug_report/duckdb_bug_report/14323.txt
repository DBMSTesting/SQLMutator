Title: Setseed doesn't affect `... using sample N`
Description:
### What happens?

Hi DDB, 

I'm looking to randomly select from a table or parquet, while setting the random seed so that the selection is the same each time. For example:
```
select setseed(0.1);

CREATE TABLE numbers AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 50) AS t(number);

select * from numbers using sample 5;
```
running this a few times yields different results on each re-run. The `setseed` function does work for generating RANDOM() numbers. 

Is it also applicable in any way to random sampling?

Thanks!

### To Reproduce

```
select setseed(0.1);

CREATE TABLE numbers AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 50) AS t(number);

select * from numbers using sample 5;
```
