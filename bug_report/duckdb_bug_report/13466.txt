Title: UNNEST should not be allowed within CASE statements
Description:
### What happens?

When building a case statement it seems the THEN part is allways evaluated. This became evident when I had `unnest(generate_series(..))` in one of my case-stements, resulting in unexpected output.

### To Reproduce

```sql
select
case
 when True then 1
 when False then unnest(generate_series(0,2))
end as x;
```
