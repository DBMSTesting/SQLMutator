Title: Creating MACRO involving RANGE FRAMING fails with "Binding error"
Description:
### What happens?

Creating a MACRO involving [Range Framing](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/window_functions#range-framing) yields a casting error.

Writing the same query in a normal SELECT statement without defining a MACRO works fine however.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE MACRO ts_smooth(x, y) AS (
  SELECT avg(y) OVER (
    ORDER BY x ASC RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 1 MONTHS PRECEDING AND INTERVAL 1 MONTHS FOLLOWING
  )
);
```

Output:
```
Binder Error: Could not choose a best candidate function for the function call "-("NULL", INTERVAL)". In order to select one, please add explicit type casts.
        Candidate functions:
        -(DATE, INTERVAL) -> TIMESTAMP
        -(TIME, INTERVAL) -> TIME
        -(TIME WITH TIME ZONE, INTERVAL) -> TIME WITH TIME ZONE
        -(INTERVAL, INTERVAL) -> INTERVAL
```

The same works fine however when not defining a MACRO:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE tmp (x DATE, val NUMERIC);

INSERT INTO tmp VALUES ('2023-01-01', 3);
INSERT INTO tmp VALUES ('2023-01-02', 4);
INSERT INTO tmp VALUES ('2023-01-03', 5);

SELECT avg(val) OVER (ORDER BY x ASC RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 1 MONTHS PRECEDING AND INTERVAL 1 MONTHS FOLLOWING) AS y FROM tmp;
```
