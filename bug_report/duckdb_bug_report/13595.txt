Title: Casting to Bit is no longer Invertible
Description:
fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2809

We allowed conversion to and from BIT. The query The problem is, when casting `-1` to bit, you loose context of if the bit is signed or not. 

The query 
```
SELECT t1.c1 FROM t1 WHERE (1 BETWEEN -1 AND CAST(CAST(t1.c1 AS BIT) AS INTEGER));
```

would eagerly remove the `(cast  X as integer)` in comparison simplification and run the following comparison for the between `(1 >= -1) and (`1 as BIT` <= `t1.c1 as BIT`).  

The second comparison would compare the string values and not the bit values. The fix here is just to make BIT casting not invertible, this way you won't loose context on weather the bit is signed or not.
