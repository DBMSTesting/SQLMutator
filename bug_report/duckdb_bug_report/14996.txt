Title: Add support for ORDER BY within window functions for MODE
Description:
### What happens?

When using `MODE(price) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY price) AS price_mcv`, if I include `ORDER BY` in the `OVER` clause, and the MCV (most common value) is larger than other values, I cannot retrieve the correct MCV.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE df AS
FROM (VALUES (123456, 2), (123456, 2), (123456, 1)) t(product_id, price);

SELECT
    product_id,
    MODE(price) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY price) AS price_mcv
FROM df;
```
