Title: Unnest on NULL giving an error, even when filtering those rows out
Description:
### What happens?

unnest on a column with NULL gives an error, even when filtering out with `where`: `BinderException: Binder Error: UNNEST() can only be applied to lists, structs and NULL`

### To Reproduce

import duckdb
import json

duckdb.sql("drop table tbl;")
with open('test2.json', 'w') as fo:
    json.dump({'test': None}, fo)
duckdb.sql("create table tbl as select * from read_json_auto('test2.json');")

duckdb.sql("""
  select unnest(test, recursive:=true) from tbl where test is not null;
""")
```
