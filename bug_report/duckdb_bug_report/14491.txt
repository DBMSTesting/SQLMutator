Title: `INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 0 within vector of size 0` when `WHERE` clause is present
Description:
### What happens?

I have a table in a file based duckdb.

Works:

```python
import duckdb

with duckdb.connect("./duck.db") as con:
    con.sql(
        "SELECT * FROM a"
    ).df()
```

Breaks with `INTERNAL Error: Attempted to access index 0 within vector of size 0`:

```python
import duckdb

with duckdb.connect("./duck.db") as con:
    con.sql(
        "SELECT * FROM a WHERE id_visit = 1489799"
    ).df()
```

Additional information:

- I cannot share the dateset and failed to reproduce it with an artificial data set.
- The error seems to occur irregardles on which column I filter
- The table is 49 columns wide and app. 7 Mio. rows
- I tested both 1.1.2 of the python API on linux aarch64 (docker container on mac) and the nightly build for the cli on linux x86_64
- the DB was create by copying tables from a postgres DB

Can someone hint me to where the problem might be so I can try to create a dataset I can share?
