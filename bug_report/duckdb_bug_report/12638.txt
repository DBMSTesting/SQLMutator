Title: performance of lateral join on timestamp fields
Description:
### What happens?

When using a lateral join on timestamp fields, it is much slower to compare timestamp fields versus casting to a Date and doing the same comparison. I mentioned this in case the difference was not expected.

### To Reproduce

```sql 
  with 
   A(a) as (select * from generate_series('2000-01-01'::TIMESTAMP, '2005-01-01'::TIMESTAMP, interval '1 hour')),
   B(b) as (select * from generate_series('2000-01-01'::TIMESTAMP, '2005-01-01'::TIMESTAMP, interval '1 day')) 
  select a, b
    from A
    join lateral (select b from B where b > a order by b limit 1) on true 
  order by 1, 2;
```

  select a, b
    from (select a, a::DATE as a_date from A)
    join lateral (select b from B where b > a_date order by b limit 1) on true 
  order by 1, 2;
