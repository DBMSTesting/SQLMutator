Title: add some RealNest benchmarks
Description:
This PR adds some benchmark queries to the RealNest JSON data as it discussed in the [issue](https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2421). 

For now there are queries to only one of the files - `hep-adl-ethz-Run2012B_SingleMu`, which is not a part of the PR, but can be found [here](https://github.com/cwida/RealNest/blob/main/sample-data/1024rows/hep-adl-ethz-Run2012B_SingleMu/data.jsonl) and should be placed in `duckdb_benchmark_data/` directory. 
Probably, the JSON file path should be changed after it becomes clear where to store RealNest test data (maybe somewhere outside of the `mount-point` of aws machine? )
