Title: Make sampling accept parameters at the parser/transformer layer
Description:
Currently sampling only accepts literals. This PR makes it also accept parameters. Currently we don't yet push the parameters through to the binding/execution layer, but it makes a query like `FROM tbl USING SAMPLE ?` throw a better error message.
