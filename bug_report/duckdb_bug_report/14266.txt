Title: delay the rewrite of a large IN-clause into a MarkJoin on remote Filter-Scans
Description:
De not do the rewrite of a large IN-clause into a MarkJoin on remote Filter-Scans

This is MotherDuck-specific but should not affect other use cases.

(MotherDuck runs optimization server-side on remote FILTER-SCANs
 and having the IN clause as a MarkJoin inhibits Hive partition
 pruning server-side).
