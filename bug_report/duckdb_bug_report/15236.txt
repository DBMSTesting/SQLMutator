Title: Polars Enum dtype is not preserved
Description:
### What happens?

A round trip of a polars dataframe with a column of enum dtype via duckdb ends up as a string type.

### To Reproduce

```py
import polars as pl
import duckdb

df = pl.DataFrame({"A": ["a", "b"], "B": pl.Series(["en", "um"], dtype=pl.Enum(["en", "um"]))})
duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM df").pl()
```
```
shape: (2, 2)
┌─────┬─────┐
│ A   ┆ B   │
│ --- ┆ --- │
│ str ┆ str │
╞═════╪═════╡
│ a   ┆ en  │
│ b   ┆ um  │
└─────┴─────┘
```
So column "B" is a `polars.String` instead of a `polars.Enum`.

Note: I used  polars 1.13.
