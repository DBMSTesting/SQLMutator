Title: VIEW created after a USING statement fails when queried without a USING statement, even when queried with its qualified name
Description:
### What happens?

It looks like queries to a `VIEW` in a custom database fail if its `SELECT` part does not specify the database name. The queries work after executing a `USING` statement.

### To Reproduce

```sql
ATTACH IF NOT EXISTS ':memory:' AS "memory1";
ATTACH IF NOT EXISTS ':memory:' AS "memory2";

USE 'memory1';
CREATE TABLE integers1(i INT, j INT, k INT);
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view1 AS FROM integers1;
SELECT * FROM view1;
```
```text
┌───────┬───────┬───────┐
│   i   │   j   │   k   │
│ int32 │ int32 │ int32 │
├───────┴───────┴───────┤
│        0 rows         │
└───────────────────────┘
```
```sql
USE 'memory2';
SELECT * FROM memory1.view1;
```
```console
Catalog Error: Table with name INTEGERS1 does not exist!
Did you mean "memory1.INTEGERS1"?
```
