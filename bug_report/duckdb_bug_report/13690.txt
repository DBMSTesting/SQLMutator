Title: [Fix] Set the dirty flag when splitting a prefix
Description:
In addition to the `Prefix` fix, I removed the following query from `test_art_duckdb_versions.test`.
```sql
query I
SELECT used_blocks < 2621440 / get_block_size('test_art_import') FROM pragma_database_size();
----
1
```
With `LATEST_STORAGE=1`, we get a slight increase in storage size. When importing the database, we pass the WAL auto checkpoint flag, which leads to `used_blocks != 0`. I.e., the CI nightly test failure was expected behavior.
