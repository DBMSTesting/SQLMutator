Title: Fix foreign key lookups from different search path
Description:
Foreign key lookups are resolved using the current search path rather than the correct catalog.

Take the following example:

```
D attach ':memory:' as db1;
D attach ':memory:' as db2;
D use db1;
D CREATE TABLE pk_integers(i INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);
D INSERT INTO pk_integers VALUES (1), (2), (3);
D CREATE TABLE fk_integers(j INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (j) REFERENCES pk_integers(i));
D use db2;
D INSERT INTO db1.fk_integers VALUES (1), (2);
Catalog Error: Table with name pk_integers does not exist!
Did you mean "db1.pk_integers"?
```

This PR fixes the issue by using the catalog of the table that has the foreign key constraint rather than going by search path.
