Title: Fix clang-format version in CONTRIBUTING.md
Description:
The version of clang-format recommended in `CONTRIBUTING.md` was not the
same as recommended by `scripts/format.py`. This fixes `CONTRIBUTING.md`
and also mentions installing it through `pipx`, since that is now the
only way Ubuntu 24.04 (and other recent OSes) recommend installing
global python packages.
