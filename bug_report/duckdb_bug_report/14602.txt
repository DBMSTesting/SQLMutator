Title: Helper c-api functions for maps and unions (**)
Description:
While Maps are internally lists of structs (key, val) and Unions are Structs and hence can be accessed directly just using the existing exposed C-API functions, these helpers make it more obvious to an API user who may not know the internal representation of these types.

```c
duckdb_vector duckdb_map_vector_get_keys(duckdb_vector vector);
duckdb_vector duckdb_map_vector_get_values(duckdb_vector vector);
duckdb_vector duckdb_union_vector_get_tags(duckdb_vector vector);
duckdb_vector duckdb_union_vector_get_member(duckdb_vector vector, uint8_t tag);
void duckdb_union_vector_set_tag(duckdb_vector vector, idx_t index, uint8_t tag);
```

`duckdb_union_vector_set_tag` sets the tag on a union vector at the requested index AND marks all the other member vectors at the same index invalid. This is related to this [discussion](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/14655).

@Tishj @samansmink @Mytherin I botched my previous PR while I was attempting to resolve merge conflicts :(. This is the previous PR (https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14554).

Hopefully third time is the charm! Apologies for the rework.
