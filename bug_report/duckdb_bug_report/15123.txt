Title: Skip building postgres_scanner due to problems instaling libxml
Description:
Solution might be overriding libxml's vcpkg config, to be experimented on postgres_scanner side, but for now skipping should unlock the fact that most CI should move forward (allowing subsequent checks to also be run).
