Title: Internal #861: Value Function SubFrames
Description:
- Convert WindowFirstValueExecutor, WindowNthValueExecutor and WindowLastValueExecutor
to use EvaluateSubFrames instead of hacking up a mask.
- Remove ExclusionFilter now that it has been replaced by frame ranges
- This also fixes a bug in EvaluateSubFrames where the subframes were not clamped to the frame itself.
