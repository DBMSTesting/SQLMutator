Title: Literal in SELECT DISTINCT ON clause raises ORDER BY non-integer literal has no effect.
Description:
### What happens?

After upgrading to DuckDB 1.1.1, I encountered an issue where DuckDB raises `Binder Error: ORDER BY non-integer literal has no effect` when having literal in `SELECT DISTINCT ON (..)` clause.

Turning order_by_non_integer_literal=true resolves the issue, allowing literal in DISTINCT ON.

The error message is really confusing as the initial cause does not come from the ORDER BY clause.

I would rather accept literal in SELECT DISTINCT clause by default or rework the error message to point out the correct SQL clause. 

### To Reproduce

```
con = duckdb.connect(":memory:")
con.execute('CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT 42 AS "column_name";')
con.execute("SET order_by_non_integer_literal = true;")
con.execute(
    "SELECT DISTINCT ON (my_table.column_name, 'co2') my_table.column_name FROM my_table"
).fetchone()

```
