Title: .duckdb_extensions cannot be properly signed by Xcode during distribution
Description:
### What happens?

**Context**

I'm embedding a complete and functional Python runtime inside a MacOS application, for the purpose of allowing both DuckDB and UDFs to be packed and available in the same application.

The required duckdb extensions for our use case are `httpfs` and `parquet`. In specific, the `httpfs` needs to be packed into the application because, during runtime, app sandbox cannot properly validate the security risk of loading the downloaded file during runtime.

During validation / distribution in Xcode, it tries to place the valid Team ID signature into the httpfs extension but, it fails. Any `codesign` calls fails on the file.

**What I have tried**

I've built the extension from source, in a way to make it available without adhoc signatures, with the following command:

```bash
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-no_adhoc_codesign" make DUCKDB_EXTENSIONS='httpfs' BUILD_EXTENSIONS_ONLY=1 DUCKDB_PLATFORM=osx_arm64
```

The extension did built successfully, and I loaded it with the `allow_unsigned_extensions` set to True:
```py
duckdb.connect(":memory:", config = {"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"})
```

But, that got nowhere, since duckdb attempts to load it with `dlopen`, but face problems dealing with dynamic libraries and unsigned files, raising: file not valid for use in process: Trying to load an unsigned library. (first image). The remainder of the error is just my python code failing to process results.

**Request**

Is it possible to work with duckdb extensions in this scenario? Is it a bug or is it an intended constraint?
