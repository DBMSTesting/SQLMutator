Title: CSV parsing gives different name format for empty vs. whitespace header
Description:
### What happens?

When parsing a CSV, a header row with an empty column will turn into `column{i}`
For instance, `a,b,c,,e` becomes `a,b,c,column3,e` 

But if the header row has a column that is just whitespace, that empty column will turn into `C{i}`
For instance, `a,b,c,  ,e` becomes `a,b,c,C3,e`

These names should probably be consistent.

Note: I'm using duckdb-wasm, but I don't believe this is a WASM specific problem. If that is the case this can be moved to that repo.

### To Reproduce

1. Create two CSVs (or just change the header in one csv) with the above differences in the first row.
2. Load both into DuckDB. I'm using the WASM bindings but I believe it still happens with other CSV parsing methods.
3. Observe the difference in column names
