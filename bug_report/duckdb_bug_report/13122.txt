Title: Retry on HTTP failure in extension install
Description:
This PR copies over the retry logic from the `httpfs` client into the extension install, allowing retries on download failures. 

Note that we should unify the configuration for the retries (e.g. retry count, back-off, etc) with the httpfs extension by moving it into the main library - that's not done yet as part of this PR.
