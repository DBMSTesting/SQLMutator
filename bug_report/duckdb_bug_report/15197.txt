Title: Rework `TableFilterType::CONSTANT_COMPARISON` to work identically to constant comparisons in SQL
Description:
This PR reworks the `TableFilterType::CONSTANT_COMPARISON` so that it works identically to constant comparisons in SQL with regards to NULL values, i.e. it filters out all `NULL` values. Previously, this used to be a bit of a mess:

* When encountering a constant comparison (e.g. `x = 5`), we would always push `x=5 AND x IS NOT NULL`
* Constant comparisons in our table scan would remove `NULL` values, and then run the `x IS NOT NULL` filter separately for no reason (since the constant comparison had already removed all `NULL` values)
* Constant comparisons when converted to expressions would be converted back into the `x = 5` form, which filters out `NULL` values, effectively not being round-trippable
* For the Parquet reader, we would actually not filter out `NULL` values in the constant comparison, but we would need to check if values were `NULL` anyway - only to then always filter them out (since we never pushed a constant comparison without a `IS NOT NULL` filter anyway)

This PR makes this consistent and speeds things up a little by skipping unnecessary checks.
