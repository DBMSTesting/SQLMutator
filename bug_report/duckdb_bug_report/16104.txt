Title: Filter with an error-throwing function getting incorrectly reordered
Description:
### What happens?

Simple `where abs(col_double) < 1 and acos(col_double) > 0` expressions can throw an error as of 1.2.0 because the filters might get reordered with `acos` being executed first while the `abs` expression is guarding against `acos` errors.

### To Reproduce

```sql
copy (select random() * 2 col_double from generate_series(1,100)) to '/tmp/r.parquet';
select * from (select * from  '/tmp/r.parquet') where abs(col_double) < 1 and acos(col_double) > 0;
```

On 1.1.3:
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│      col_double      │
│        double        │
├──────────────────────┤
│  0.19490873625576743 │
│   0.9895238863469309 │  
...
```

On 1.2.0:
```
Invalid Input Error:
ACOS is undefined outside [-1,1]
```
