Title: Feature #12699: XXX_VALUE Secondary Sorts
Description:
- Plumb through ordering arguments for window functions
- Pull out the quantile merge sort tree into a shared class that can be reused for other window functions.
- Replace the QuantileSortTree internals with a WindowIndexTree.
- Use a WindowIndexTree to implement secondary sorting for FIRST/LAST/NTH_VALUE window functions.
