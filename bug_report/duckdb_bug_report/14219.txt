Title: Add column to a struct
Description:
### What happens?

Assume an existing table with a single row of type struct.
Now we want to add a column to the name struct with 'alter table ...'.
It either seems not possible to do this or the documentation is lacking how this can be done?

Is this supported in duckdb as we rely heavily on structs and sometimes we need to add a column to a struct.

### To Reproduce

```sql
create table test ( name struct(firstname varchar, lastname varchar));
insert into test values ( {lastname:'Jansen', firstname:'Erik'});
```

```sql
alter table test alter column name type struct(firstname varchar, lastname varchar, gender varchar);
```

```console
Mismatch Type Error: Type STRUCT(firstname VARCHAR, lastname VARCHAR) does not match with STRUCT(firstname VARCHAR, lastname VARCHAR, gender VARCHAR). Cannot cast STRUCTs of different size
```
