Title: chore: add check to make sure it's git repo before executing git cmd
Description:
We've seen issues where `duckdb_extension_generate_version` is called when the directory is not a git repo and that results in an error that looks like below:
```
#40 16.21 -- Found Git: /usr/bin/git (found version "2.34.1") 
[921](https://github.com/motherduckdb/mono/actions/runs/10254464263/job/28369332071?pr=5675#step:5:934)
#40 16.21 fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

#40 16.21   --format=%h'.
```
Adding a check to make sure that the directory is a git repo before jumping into running the Git cmd allows the project to be compiled without us needing to make some custom hack (like [this one](https://github.com/motherduckdb/duckdb_delta/commit/ab14c07b2820e2d48c6ac118faea5c783e7f522d)) to circumvent the error.
