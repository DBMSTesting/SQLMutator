Title: [Dev] Fix output (long lines > 333 characters) getting truncated in shell
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-web/issues/4734

`zBuf` was probably used at some point, but it's now entirely unused, only used to truncate the output for no reason, causing all lines to get capped to 333 characters.
