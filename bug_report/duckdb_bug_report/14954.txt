Title: C API support for non-standard timestamp values
Description:
Updated subset of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14865.

New C API types:
- `duckdb_timestamp_s`
- `duckdb_timestamp_ms`
- `duckdb_timestamp_ns`

New C API functions:
- Finiteness checks:
  - `duckdb_is_finite_timestamp_s`
  - `duckdb_is_finite_timestamp_ms`
  - `duckdb_is_finite_timestamp_ns`
- Value creation/access:
  - `duckdb_create_timestamp_tz`, `duckdb_get_timestamp_tz`
  - `duckdb_create_timestamp_s`, `duckdb_get_timestamp_s`
  - `duckdb_create_timestamp_ms`, `duckdb_get_timestamp_ms`
  - `duckdb_create_timestamp_ns`, `duckdb_get_timestamp_ns`

New unit tests for all new functions have been added, along with support in the CAPI Tester to fetch these types.

To get these working, I also added:
- New trivial cast operations for these types.
- A missing case in GetCTypeSize (TIMESTAMP_TZ).

(Without these changes, the new tests fail.)
