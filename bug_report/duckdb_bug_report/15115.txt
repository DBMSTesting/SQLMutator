Title: fsspec / Samba connection issue
Description:
### What happens?

Can't open remote file using `read_csv()` because of 

`ValueError: Failed to connect to 'nas.example.comsmb::445': [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`.

Pay attention, that error message shows incorrect domain name. Somehow it inserted `smb:` between host and port.

### To Reproduce

Code snippet to reproduce:

```python
import fsspec
import duckdb

fs = fsspec.filesystem('smb', host='nas.example.com', username='username', password='password')

print(f'Exists? {fs.exists("/share/file.csv")}')  # quick confirmation that fs is working and file exists

duckdb.register_filesystem(fs)
df = duckdb.sql('SELECT * FROM read_csv("smb:///share/file.csv")').df()
```
