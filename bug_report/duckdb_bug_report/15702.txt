Title: Storage version 65
Description:
This adds the possibility for DuckDB to read (and modify) files of a new storage version. Those files are (at this moment) identical to files version 64 (that has been the default since `v0.10.1`), with a significant change that they can't be opened by previous DuckDB version.

This would make possible to guard features touching storage that are incompatible with previous DuckDB versions, such as improved compression methods.

The meaning of the data in `src/storage/version_map.json` changes from being the exact storage version produced by a given DuckDB version to the maximum storage version produced. Note that this is compatible with previous interpretation, where the LOWER and UPPER bounds happened to be the same.

Opening files with storage_version=65 with older duckdb versions will produce error messages that point to https://duckdb.org/docs/internals/storage.html, where this is documented.

Only visible (at the SQL level) version of this change is that now DuckDB AttachedDatabases have a `storage_version` tag.

This PR is to be followed by a reworked version of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14981.
