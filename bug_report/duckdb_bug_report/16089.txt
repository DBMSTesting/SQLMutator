Title: 1.2 API break for default_connection in python library
Description:
### What happens?

The default connection attribute of the duckdb python module changed from an attribute to a function call in version 1.2.
The cause of the change was from #13442
Not sure if you consider this a bug or an API break, but the documentation is wrong either way.

https://duckdb.org/docs/archive/1.1/api/python/reference/index  shows it as an attribute,
and the latest (1.2 as of this issue)
https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/reference/index.html  also shows it as an attribute, not a function.

### To Reproduce

```bash
uv run --with="duckdb==1.0" python -c 'import duckdb; print(type(duckdb.default_connection))'
uv run --with="duckdb==1.1" python -c 'import duckdb; print(type(duckdb.default_connection))'
uv run --with="duckdb==1.2" python -c 'import duckdb; print(type(duckdb.default_connection))'
```

```python
<class 'duckdb.duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection'>
<class 'duckdb.duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection'>
<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
```
