Title: Add Pyodide 0.26.1 (corresponding to Python 3.12)
Description:
One change that I made to core is renaming `GetCurrentCPU` to `GetEstimatedCPUId`, this is due to the fact Emscripten (+ multithreaded) it's not super trivial to get that number, and if the return is only approximate anyway, I think it should be clearly stated in the function name that it should NOT be relied to return the actual current CPU.

The implementation `return 0;` is fine in single threaded Wasm, but then I realized also in multithreaded case, or wherever the thread infrastructure might be too heavy.

I might need to swap EMSCRIPTEN + multithreaded to use `return (idx_t)std::hash<std::thread::id>()(std::this_thread::get_id());`, that would make more sense. I added a `FIXME` about that.
