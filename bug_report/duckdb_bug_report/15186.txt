Title: Keep track of compression function in ColumnData, and add dedicated `select` call to compression function
Description:
This PR adds an optional `select` callback to compression functions, that can be used to fetch a subset of a vector (specified by a selection vector):

```cpp
typedef void (*compression_select_t)(ColumnSegment &segment, ColumnScanState &state, idx_t vector_count, Vector &result, SelectionVector &sel, idx_t sel_count);
```

This allows us to do partial decompression of values. This is particularly effective for non-selective queries. This PR implements the selection callback for RLE vectors, uncompressed strings, FSST-compressed vectors and validity segments. 

If the select callback is not provided, the previous approach (`Scan + Slice`) is used instead.
