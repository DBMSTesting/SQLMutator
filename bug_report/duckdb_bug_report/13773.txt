Title: [Python] Ensure GIL is not held when an interaction with the PyFileSystem is done
Description:
Continuation on #13768

Making sure that the GIL is not hold while we're binding, we now assert that this is the case in any interaction with the PyFileSystem.
While this is not the case in the relevant issue (the main thread holds the GIL, the worker thread that does the interaction doesn't), that is a special circumstance and in general the interaction would be done by the main thread during binding.
