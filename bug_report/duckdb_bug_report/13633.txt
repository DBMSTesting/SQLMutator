Title: fix REGEX not supported anymore for valid queries (only statement error) #2889
Description:
This PR should fix the https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2889

The function matching expected and actual result messages, `FullMatch()`, didn't work well with a reference to a `MaterializedQueryResult` object (`&result.ToString()`) casted to a string. 
What changed: pass the (expected) result to the match checking function as a string instead of passing an object by reference.
