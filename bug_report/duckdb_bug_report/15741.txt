Title: Compound SELECT statement fails in duckdb-swift
Description:
### What happens?

When executing a compound SELECT statement the Swift API fails. Here is the statement being queried:

       SELECT 
            articles.id, category, summary, headline, link, date, merged, 
            merged_links, validated, thumbnail, full_story, 
            array_distance(embeddings.embedding, (SELECT embedding FROM embeddings WHERE story_id = '\(searchArticleID)')) AS distance
        FROM articles
        JOIN embeddings ON embeddings.story_id = articles.id
        ORDER BY distance
        LIMIT 10;

Weirdly if I create a View from this statement it works fine, appears in the db, and contains the records I'm expecting. This statement works fine:

        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW related AS SELECT 
            articles.id, category, summary, headline, link, date, merged, 
            merged_links, validated, thumbnail, full_story, 
            array_distance(embeddings.embedding, (SELECT embedding FROM embeddings WHERE story_id = '\(searchArticleID)')) AS distance
        FROM articles
        JOIN embeddings ON embeddings.story_id = articles.id
        ORDER BY distance
        LIMIT 10;

### To Reproduce

```
SELECT 
            articles.id, category, summary, headline, link, date, merged, 
            merged_links, validated, thumbnail, full_story, 
            array_distance(embeddings.embedding, (SELECT embedding FROM embeddings WHERE story_id = '\(searchArticleID)')) AS distance
        FROM articles
        JOIN embeddings ON embeddings.story_id = articles.id
        ORDER BY distance
        LIMIT 10;
```

```
        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW related AS SELECT 
            articles.id, category, summary, headline, link, date, merged, 
            merged_links, validated, thumbnail, full_story, 
            array_distance(embeddings.embedding, (SELECT embedding FROM embeddings WHERE story_id = '\(searchArticleID)')) AS distance
        FROM articles
        JOIN embeddings ON embeddings.story_id = articles.id
        ORDER BY distance
        LIMIT 10;
```
