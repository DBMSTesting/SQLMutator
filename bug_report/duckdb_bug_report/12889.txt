Title: Use different versions of snappy depending on the compiler
Description:
`#ifdef __clang__` use the new version, `#else` use the old version.

The newer version is much faster, but only if clang is the compiler. If compiled with GCC, the new version is slower. Hence why we now have two snappy versions and select when compiling.
