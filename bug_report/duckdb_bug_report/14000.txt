Title: fix julia partitions for streaming result
Description:
Previously, calling `nextDataChunk` on a streaming result failed to update the `chunk_index`. This in turn caused the check to prevent double iteration on `Tables.partitions(q::QueryResult)` to fail for streaming data.

Now the `chunk_index` is always updated after a successful `nextDataChunk` call. I've added tests that iterating partitions works when it should and throws `NotImplementedException` if one attempts to iterate twice.
