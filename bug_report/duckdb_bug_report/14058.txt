Title: fix parquet cardinality when first file is empty
Description:
Parquet scan func uses the first file for binding data, it will result to 0 `ParquetCardinality` if the 1st file has empty row, which impact performance significantly.

Steps to reproduce:
```
SET threads TO 16;
CREATE or replace VIEW t1 AS ( select * from read_parquet([ 'empty.parquet', 'non-empty.parquet' ], union_by_name=True ));
CREATE or replace VIEW t2 AS ( select * from read_parquet([ 'non-empty.parquet' ], union_by_name=True ));
select * from t1 join t2 on t1.id similar to t2.id;
```
