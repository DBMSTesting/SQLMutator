Title: Error in python relational API when querying only a column with a hyphen in the name
Description:
### What happens?

When I have a table or view with a column that has a hyphen in the name, then I get an error when I try to query only that column via the Python Relational API. The error happens ONLY when the list of columns in my query only contains the hyphenated column. So if I add another column to the query that is not hyphenated, then the query works correctly.

### To Reproduce

```python
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

df = pd.DataFrame({'hello': [1,2,3], 'hel-lo': [1,2,3]})
duckdb.from_df(df).select('hello', 'hel-lo').df() # works
duckdb.from_df(df).select('hel-lo').df() # error
```
Here is the error:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----> 1 duckdb.from_df(df2).select('hel-lo').df()
