Title: Multiple pivots prior to create call have wrong/unexpected behavior
Description:
### What happens?

when you run multiple pivot statements before turning their relations into tables, all but the last get clobbered with nonsense.
I'm running linux but the same problem occurs on windows.

details in reproduction code.

### To Reproduce

```python
# demonstrate bug
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import duckdb
N = 1000
df = pd.DataFrame({"a":np.random.choice(["u", "v", "w"], N, True),
                   "b":np.random.choice(["x", "y", "z"], N, True),
                   "c":np.random.randn(N),})
conn = duckdb.connect()

ddf = conn.from_df(df)
ddf.create("input_data")

xx = conn.query("pivot input_data on a using max(c) group by b;")
yy = conn.query("pivot input_data on b using max(c) group by a;")
xx.create("xx")
yy.create("yy")
print(conn.query("SHOW ALL TABLES;").df())
xx_table = conn.table("xx")
yy_table = conn.table("yy")
assert set(yy.columns)==set(yy_table.columns) # Succeeds.
assert set(xx.columns)==set(xx_table.columns)  # Fails. 
# xx_table shows up with cols [b, x, y, z] and all nans in the x,y,z cols
# The first col should indeed by b, but the next 3 should be u,v,w and they shouldn't have all nans
```
