Title: Avoid throwing on failure to open extensions's .info file (when force installing)
Description:
Idea is that if `.info` files ends up being corrupt, you will be stuck in a loop like:
```
duckdb -c "FORCE INSTALL x"
IO Error: Failed to read info file for 'x' extension: ...
....
Try reinstalling the extension using 'FORCE INSTALL x;'
```

And given in the force_install codepath (that is either in case of `FORCE INSTALL` or in case of `UPDATE EXTENSIONS`) the info file will be rewritten in any case I think this is OK, and there is no need to notify user that this happened.
In the LOAD codepath this will still be visible, we only need a way to get unblocked (yes, removing the file works, but it's not super cool).

Note that we could also just avoid the read (but only in the case of proper `FORCE INSTALL`), but I wanted avoid yet another slightly different codepath.
