Title: Implement PullUp Empty Results optimizer
Description:
Currently this logic is sprinkled within filter pull up and filter push down. The problem is it's not at every operator, and adding empty results across multiple files within the filter pullup/pushdown operator can make the code hard to maintain and debug. 

This will unify the code and fix some fuzzer issues that are the cause of long execution times on the LHS of a join while a child on the RHS is empty . It can also help make other queries faster in a few cases.

One con is that some `ConversionErrors` will be hidden.
