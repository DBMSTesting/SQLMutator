Title: [Feature]: Implement write support (POST) in HTTPFS extension
Description:
This _(humble)_ PR implements basic write (POST) support for the HTTPFS extension. 

The implementation is intentionally simple, extending existing methods without introducing new dependencies.

The current validation is performed using JSON format and a [simple backend demo](https://gist.github.com/lmangani/57550cce344e41608782cc4021fda39f) handling GET/POST requests and generally compatible with the ClickHouse `url` function in terms of functionality.  The [demo backend](https://github.com/lmangani/duckdb-urlengine) in the example is public and open for testing, where the /path is the unique key to set/get data.

This Draft is looking for guidance and review from the core team to help grow this into a proper feature PR 🤞 

```sql
D SET autoload_known_extensions=1; SET autoinstall_known_extensions=1;
D COPY (SELECT version() as version, 9999 as number) TO 'https://duckserver.glitch.me/test' (FORMAT JSON);
D SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('https://duckserver.glitch.me/test');
┌─────────┬────────┐
│ version │ number │
