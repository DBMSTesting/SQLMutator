Title: Fixup extension selection
Description:
Fix various problems connected to rework of extension uploading:
* non properly tested CMake syntax made postgres (and mysql, delta, and a few other extensions) being skipped
* osx_arm64 folder would detele itself since extensions were uploaded too late
* wam extension were skipped since only pattern *.duckdb_extension was considered for upload
