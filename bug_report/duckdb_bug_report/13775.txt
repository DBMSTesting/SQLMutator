Title: Grab lock in `AddWrittenBlock` in `WriteOverflowStringsToDisk`
Description:
Follow-up fix from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13618

Since that PR we now track blocks of overflow strings in the `PartialBlockManager`. When checkpointing, if multiple threads are all writing overflow strings, this can lead to contention, so we need to grab the lock here.
