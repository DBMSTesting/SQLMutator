Title: duckdb_string_t behavior does not match documentation
Description:
### What happens?

For non-inlined behavior, the `.ptr` is supposed to "store a pointer to the *remaining characters*". But it when I wrote a small test program, it seems like the pointer is actually pointing to a *full copy* of the *complete string*, not just the *remaining characters*.  

For reference, here is the duckdb_string_t and associated documentation.

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/3240832cddb955d4240cf2d3adcc053b77c88717/src/include/duckdb.h#L343-L359

I'm actually quite happy with this "misbehavior" because otherwise you have to write code to glue together prefix and suffix to turn it the data into a contiguous string. I'm just checking here that the documentation is in error, in which case I should go and delete the little string gluing function I wrote.
