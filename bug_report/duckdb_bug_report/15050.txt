Title: CLI: Add -f [FILE] argument that allows execution of a file
Description:
Usage:

`duckdb -f [FILE]`

Similar to `-c`, but reads the commands from a file. 

Note that this seems similar to `-init [FILE]` at first glance as well, but there are several differences:
* `-f [FILE]` exits after it is done executing commands
* `-init [FILE]` replaces the reading of `~/.duckdbrc`, `-f` does not
* `-f [FILE]` can be executed multiple times
* `-f [FILE]` plays "nicely" with `-c` - commands are executed in the same order as they appear

For example:

```sql
echo 'create table tbl(i int);' > create.sql
echo 'insert into tbl values (42), (84);' > load.sql
duckdb -f create.sql -f load.sql -c "SELECT SUM(i) FROM tbl"
┌────────┐
│ sum(i) │
│ int128 │
├────────┤
│    126 │
└────────┘
```
