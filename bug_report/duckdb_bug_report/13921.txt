Title: Fix #13769: when binding views, always first search in the schema that the view is defined in
Description:
Fixes #13769 

This PR reworks the way that the search path is used during binding. Previously, we would always use the clients' global search path to bind. This PR reworks that so that when binding a view, we expand the search path using the catalog/schema in which the view is located.

This allows us to query views that depend on other elements within the same catalog (e.g. tables or other views), without having to modify the clients' global search path (using e.g. the `USE` statement). This is particularly helpful when attaching databases that contain views.
