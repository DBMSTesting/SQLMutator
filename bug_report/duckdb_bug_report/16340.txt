Title: regexp_replace silently ignores errors in the regexp pattern
Description:
### What happens?

`regexp_replace` silently returns the original string if the regexp pattern contains errors.
This is not the case for ` regexp_matches`.

### To Reproduce

`regexp_replace` seems to ignore errors:
```
select regexp_replace('abc', '*', 'X');
```
Postgres throws an error: "invalid regular expression"
DuckDB returns `abc`

But `regexp_matches` properly throws errors:
```
select regexp_matches('abc', '*');
```
DuckDB and Postgres both complain about the invalid regular expression.
