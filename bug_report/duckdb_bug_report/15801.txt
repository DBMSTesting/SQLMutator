Title: Expressions in create secret
Description:
fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14829

This PR allows for expressions to be used in CREATE SECRET statements. This is useful because it enables injecting values fetched from other queries or functions into a secret. For example:

```SQL
SET VARIABLE my_bearer_token='hocus pocus this token is bogus';
CREATE SECRET http (TYPE HTTP, BEARER_TOKEN getvariable('my_bearer_token'));
```

Note that this PR make a pretty serious change to the way the CREATE SECRET is parsed and therefore I have PR-ed this into main, not the v1.2 release branch meaning that this feature will not be available for v1.2.0.

Nevertheless I have tried to preserve the old syntax as much as possible by:
- Allowing passing structs without keys into the scope field to support the old `CREATE SECRET (type x, scope ('...', '...'))` along with the now recommended `CREATE SECRET (type x, scope ['...', '...'])` passing in a LIST(VARCHAR) constant
- Converting `COLUMN_REF` expressions to `CONSTANT` expressions allowing `CREATE SECRET (type x, key value)` along with the now recommended `CREATE SECRET (type x, key 'value')`
