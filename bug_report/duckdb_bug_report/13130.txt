Title: better CE for comparisons that use `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. 
Description:
Fixes: https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2557

The solution is pretty basic, it just inspects the comparison type and adjusts the cardinality based on the checked comparisons.

Most joins are an `=` or `NOT_DISTINCT_FROM` and our CE is pretty good when it is that kind of a comparison. For other comparison types, however, we severely underestimate (since we used to always assume an `=`). This prevents the situation in the mentioned issue, where a `!=` comparison gets pushed down as a join condition, when that is not desirable at all. 

In the future, this step to inspect the comparison can be a completely separate module for CE, but for now I think this is a nice way to prevent cases where an assumed FK=PK produces an egregiously bad plan
