Description:
### What happens?

The query "select '1969-01-01T23:59:59.9999999'::timestamp_ns;" gives the following error:

```
INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast: value -99952 outside of target range [-128, 127]
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
