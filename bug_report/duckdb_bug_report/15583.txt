Title: In PhysicalInsert call FinalFlush before merging row groups into local storage
Description:
This fixes an issue where sporadically we could run into a nullpointer exception when flushing partial blocks later on.

Essentially what could happen is that we would have blocks that were added to the partial block manager in the transaction-local storage get appended to later on again, leading to the same segment being registered with multiple partial blocks. Flushing the partial block manager before merging the segments resolves this issue as it ensures the segments are converted into disk-backed persistent blocks, which prevents them from being appended to again later on.
