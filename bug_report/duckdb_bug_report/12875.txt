Title: CTE column value changes every time the table is used
Description:
### What happens?

When I have a CTE that sets `uuid() as "id"`, the value of the column `"id"` changes every time I select from that table

### To Reproduce

This query
```
with "table1" as (
    select uuid() as "id",
    'test' as "name"
), "table2" as (
    select
        "table1"."id" as "table1_id",
        'test' as "name"
    from "table1"
)
select "table1"."id", "table1"."name", "table2"."table1_id", "table2"."name"
from "table1"
join "table2" on "table2"."name" = "table1"."name";
```

return different `"id"` and `"table1_id"`
