Title: Release GIL during DB instantiation
Description:
DuckDB's Python package is releasing the GIL ([Global Interpreter Lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock)) whenever it is running a query. This allows concurrently running queries with the Python package. When loading a database with the Python `duckdb.connect("some_db")` call, it is not releasing the GIL to do the DuckDB-level database instantiation. In some cases this instantiation can be long-running, however (e.g. when replaying WAL). By not releasing the GIL, this prevents any other type of concurrent execution while that is happening.
