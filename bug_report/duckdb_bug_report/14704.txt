Title: ROW_NUMBER OVER PARTITION BY returns bigint
Description:
### What happens?

Hello. I am trying to use DuckDB-WASM to conduct some sql queries with my csv file.
Then I just encountered this situation where ROW_NUMBER OVER PARTITION BY does not really return a proper integer.

The problem is, when I run this query,
```
WITH SalesCTE AS (
  SELECT
    Region,
    Category,
    SUM(Sales) AS total_sales
  FROM newTable
  GROUP BY Region, Category
)
SELECT
  Region,
  Category,
  total_sales,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS rank
FROM SalesCTE
```

I get this.

So, `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS rank` actually returned bigint, rather than double or integer. Sure I can CAST it into double, but why is this happening?

By the way, I am using this custom function to parse the result into json.
```
async function queryToJSON(dbConnection, query) {
  const queryResult = await dbConnection.query(query);
  const columns = queryResult.schema.fields.map(({ name }) => name);
  const out = [];
  for (const row of queryResult.toArray()) {
  	out.push(Object.fromEntries(columns.map((col) => [col, row[col]])));
  }
  return out;
}
```

### To Reproduce

[Global Superstore_latest.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17625398/Global.Superstore_latest.csv)
This is the open source csv file that I am testing these queries.
