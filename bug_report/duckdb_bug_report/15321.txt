Title: Skipping lookups in `GroupedAggregateHashTable` if (almost) everything is unique
Description:
We can skip doing lookups and deduplication in `GroupedAggregateHashTable` in the first phase of `RadixPartitionedHashTable` if (almost) everything is unique. We do lookups and deduplication in the second phase anyway. I've set thresholds such that this triggers after seeing `262144` tuples, of which 95% were unique.

This optimization speeds up queries like the following where there are many unique values:
```sql
select count(*) from (select distinct l_orderkey, l_linenumber from lineitem);
```
At TPC-H SF100, the execution time is reduced from ~5.2s to ~4.5s.
