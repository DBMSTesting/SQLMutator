Title: asof join's result is incorrect in v1.1.0  when add filter for right table on join condition
Description:
### What happens?

asof join's result is incorrect in v1.1.0  when add filter for right table on join condition

### To Reproduce

data prepare
```sql
create table t1(seq_no int,amount decimal(10,2));
insert into t1
values
(1,1.00),(2,null),(3,null),(4,null),(5,2.00),
(6,null),(7,null),(8,3.00),(9,null),(10,null),(11,5.00);
```

diff results between v1.1.0 and v1.0.0 when query as below
```sql
select * from t1;
select a.seq_no,a.amount,b.amount
  from t1 as a 
  asof join t1 as b
    on a.seq_no>=b.seq_no
   and b.amount is not null;
```
expect result:
|seq_no|amount|amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|1.00|1.00|
|2||1.00|
|3||1.00|
|4||1.00|
|5|2.00|2.00|
|6||2.00|
|7||2.00|
|8|3.00|3.00|
|9||3.00|
|10||3.00|
|11|5.00|5.00|

result in v1.1.0
|seq_no|amount|amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|1.00|1.00|
|5|2.00|2.00|
|8|3.00|3.00|
|11|5.00|5.00|

change right table with filter to sub-query.results between v1.1.0 and v1.0.0 are the same.

```sql
select a.seq_no,a.amount,b.amount
  from t1 as a
  asof join (select seq_no,amount
               from t1
              where amount is not null
            ) as b
    on a.seq_no>=b.seq_no;
```
result:
|seq_no|amount|amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|1.00|1.00|
|2||1.00|
|3||1.00|
|4||1.00|
|5|2|2.00|
|6||2.00|
|7||2.00|
|8|3|3.00|
|9||3.00|
|10||3.00|
|11|5|5.00|
