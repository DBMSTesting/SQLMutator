Title: fix(parquet): two-complement zeroes check on FIXED_BYTE_ARRAY encoded DECIMAL (#12621)
Description:
â€¦ 

If a DECIMAL is encoded in a FIXED_BYTE_ARRAY, the stored value can be smaller that the array size, for example as a INT64 (8B) stored in a 16B FIXED_BYTE_ARRAY. In these case also the zero-bytes should be checked as two-complement.
