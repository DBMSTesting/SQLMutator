Title: Pushdown inequality filters
Description:
This PR extends the table filter pushdown to include inequality filters. The support had been mostly there but they have just not been generated by the optimizer. This enables row group pruning based on zonemaps and early-pruning of scans of vectors using inequality filters. As with any filter this is particularly effective when the filter is very selective.
