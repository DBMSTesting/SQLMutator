Title: `make bundle-library` doesn't work on windows
Description:
### What happens?

The `bundle-library` target for make assumes the system uses the `.a` extension, and the location of these archives.
Both of these are different on windows, the extension should be `.lib`, and the files are all inside a `Release` directory.
eg: `src/Release/duckdb_static.lib`, `third_party/*/Release/duckdb_*.lib` and `extension/*/Release/*_extension.lib `

### To Reproduce

Run `make bundle-library`

### OS:

windows amd64 (normal github CI)

### DuckDB Version:

1.0.0

### DuckDB Client:

### Full Name:

Jaap
