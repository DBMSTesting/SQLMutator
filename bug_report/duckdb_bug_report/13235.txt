Title: Add support for providing a Column Definition List in the alias to a table function
Description:
This feature is listed under <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/queries-table-expressions.html> at `7.2.1.4. Table Functions`

### Inspiration

Postgres requires this syntax to be used when calling user/extension defined table functions that produce a RECORD.
DuckDB does not have this limitation, table functions can decide for themselves what names+types should be produced and can inform the binder+planner of this.

### Functionality

Because of this, our interpretation of the `column definition` list is different than that of postgres.
It is entirely optional, but can serve as an easy way to cast results of table functions to the desired type and gives the option to limit the amount of columns produced by a function (positionally).

### Future work:

In the future we have plans to use this to generically enable table functions that currently take a scalar to become table in-out functions, which is possible because of the defined schema.
