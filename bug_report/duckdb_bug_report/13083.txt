Title: [CSV Sniffer] Sniffer can now sniff files with extra delimiters
Description:
This PR makes it possible that the sniffer can correctly sniff files with extra delimiters on the data part of the CSV file, if they don't have any data there.

For example
```
Vendor Name;Test
Start Date;06/02/2024
End Date;06/29/2024
Transaction Date;Settlement;Date
06/19/2024;06/22/2024;1435055555;		
06/14/2024;06/14/2024;1435055555;			
```
will result in a table with header:
```
Transaction Date;Settlement;Date
```

and data:
```
06/19/2024;06/22/2024;1435055555	
06/14/2024;06/14/2024;1435055555
```

Hence it will automatically skip the first 3 rows with an unfit number of columns, and it will ignore the extra delimiter on the data part of the file, after the header.
