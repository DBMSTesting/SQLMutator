Title: Sample Reservoir with Repeatable arg yield to not repeatable results
Description:
### What happens?

I have the following complex query:
```
    SELECT 
    t2.*,
    t1.toolname,
    c.*
    FROM df_X t1
    JOIN df_X_snapshot t2 ON t1.tid = t2.tid
    JOIN df_c c ON t1.tid = c.tid
    WHERE t1.re IN ('ME-22')
    AND t2._t < '2024-03-01 00:00:00' 
    AND t2.r = false
    AND t2.b = false
    AND t2.xxx > 100
    AND t2.xxx < 10000000
    AND t2.is_last_measurement = false AND t1.hasRepair = false AND t2.snapshot_count > 5 USING SAMPLE reservoir(101000 ROWS) REPEATABLE (42);
```
  I would expect to always get the same results. However I get different results each time I am calling the function with
con.execute(con)

### To Reproduce

```
df1 = con.execute(query).pl()
df2 = con.execute(query).pl()
```
where query is the one mentioned above

df2 != df1
