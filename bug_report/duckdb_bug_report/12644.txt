Title: Do not quote fields with space in the CSV output mode
Description:
This code, originally ported from SQLite, quotes strings with spaces in them:

```sql
.mode csv
select 'hello world' AS s, 42 as x;
```

```text
s,x
"hello world",42
```

With this PR applied:

```sql
.mode csv
select 'hello world' AS s, 42 as x;
```

```text
s,x
hello world,42
```
