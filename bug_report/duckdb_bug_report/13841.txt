Title: INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL!
Description:
### What happens?

When I run a query on a specific CSV, I get:

```
INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL!
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```

### To Reproduce

```
echo "column1,column2\nyes,no\nyes,yes,yes\nyes" > error.csv
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('error.csv', rejects_table='rejects_table');
```

(if you remove `rejects_table='rejects_table'`, no error is thrown)

The result with duckdb `1.0.0`:

```
D SELECT * FROM read_csv('error.csv', rejects_table='rejects_table');
┌─────────┬─────────┐
│ column1 │ column2 │
│ varchar │ varchar │
├─────────┼─────────┤
│ yes     │ no      │
└─────────┴─────────┘
```
