Title: Implement custom `std::allocator`
Description:
This PR implements a custom `std::allocator` that uses jemalloc rather than the default allocator.

I got this working for almost all stl containers, but had to disable for `unordered_map` and `vector`, sadly, which are our most used containers :(

The reason for this is that these tests would run into very strange errors in jemalloc's internal cleanup when threads were closed in `TaskScheduler::RelaunchThreadsInternal`:
```
test/extension/test_alias_point.test
"Test using a remote optimizer pass in case thats important to someone"
```

I hope to enable our own custom allocator for these containers in the future, but I thought it would be best to send the PR now, as it already touches many files.

I've also reverted the number of salt bits to 16 when jemalloc is enabled, as we can be sure that only 48 bits are used for the pointer when jemalloc is enabled.
