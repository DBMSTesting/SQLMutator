Title: `INSTALL ... FROM ...;` failure
Description:
### What happens?

The manual says: "INSTALL can be used with the path to [...] a .duckdb_extension file."

I built duckdb locally with BUILD_JSON=1 and verified that the file:

/Users/me/github/duckdb/build/release/extension/json/json.duckdb_extension

exists.

However, running duckdb commands such as:

install json from 'local_build_release';

or

install json from '/Users/me/github/duckdb/build/release/extension/json';

all fail.  The last fails with the message:

IO Error: Failed to copy local extension "json" at PATH "/Users/me/github/duckdb/build/release/extension/json/f5ab7c167e/osx_amd64/json.duckdb_extension"

Fortunately, creating a symbolic link based on the above line did solve the problem.


Version: v1.0.1-dev4052


### To Reproduce

From the Mac OS prompt: 
```
cd ~/github/duckdb   # home of local duckdb repository
export BUILD_JSON=1
make
cd  ~
~/github/build/release/duckdb
```
From the DuckDB prompt: as shown above.
