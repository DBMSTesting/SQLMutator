Title: Unexpected result when comparing `STRUCT` with `INET`
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test case generated by my fuzzer. There should be an issue in either the second query or the third, since the second query return `NULL`, and thus the third query should return an empty table. However, one row is fetched.

I built duckdb with `CORE_EXTENSIONS='inet' GEN=ninja make`. It could also be triggered by nightly build of duckdb-java.

### To Reproduce

```sql

CREATE TABLE  t1(c0 INT, c1 INET);
INSERT INTO t1(c0, c1) VALUES (1, '192.168.1.1');

SELECT * FROM t1; -- 1 192.168.1.1
SELECT ((NULL, t1.c0, NULL)<>(t1.c1)) FROM t1; -- NULL
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ((NULL, t1.c0, NULL)<>(t1.c1));
-- Expected: empty
-- Actual: 1 192.168.1.1

-- original test case found by TLP
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ((NULL, t1.c0, NULL)<>(t1.c1)) UNION ALL SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (NOT ((NULL, t1.c0, NULL)<>(t1.c1))) UNION ALL SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ((((NULL, t1.c0, NULL)<>(t1.c1))) IS NULL);
-- 2 rows (unexpected)
```
