Title: Unify DESCRIBE [query] and DESCRIBE [table]
Description:
Implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13950

This PR unifies `SHOW/DESCRIBE` for tables and for queries. Instead of having a separate code path for when `DESCRIBE [table]` is called that directly accesses the underlying `TableCatalogEntry` - we now instead traverse the query plan in `DESCRIBE [query]` to retrieve constraint information. As a result, we now display constraint information also for queries like `DESCRIBE SELECT * FROM tbl`, or `DESCRIBE SELECT col_name FROM tbl`.

In addition, this PR also makes replacement scans work with describe - i.e. we can now run `DESCRIBE "file.parquet"` or `DESCRIBE df` directly.
