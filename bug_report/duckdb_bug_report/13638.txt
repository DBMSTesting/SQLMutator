Title: Change SQL autocompletion function name into a pragma rather than sql_auto_complete
Description:
### What happens?

Hey there!

I'm working on providing an alternative autocompletion module using fuzzy string searching called [fuzzycompletion](https://github.com/rustyconover/duckdb-fuzzycomplete-extension). Currently, the code in `shell.c` specifies that it should call `sql_auto_complete` to retrieve completions. Since many binaries build in the `autocomplete` module function, I can't override the definition for the `sql_auto_complete` function in my extension, which means those users can't use the extension.

Here's the relevant code snippet that I'd like to change.

https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/06e9a0b93cfc782b45289472988206e1f33296d6/tools/shell/shell.c#L14234

What I'd like to propose is creating a new `pragma` called `sql_auto_complete_function_name`, defaulted to the value of `sql_auto_complete`. Then, I'd change the code in `shell.c` to first look up the value of the `pragma`, and then call the function that is referenced.

When my extension is loaded, it would override the setting of the `pragma` to the completion function it provides.

Thanks for considering this!  Since 1.1.0 is so close, should this wait until the next release?

Cheers,

Rusty
