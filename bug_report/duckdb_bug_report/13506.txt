Title: Unexpected result when casting negative integer to `BIT`
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test case. The third query should return an empty result, as `CAST(CAST(t1.c1 AS BIT) AS INTEGER)` is evaluated to `-1` and the expression should be false. However, the query returns `-1`, which is unexpected. 

I found in PostgreSQL, the second query would be evaluated as `true`. Either the second or the third query is unexpected.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE  t1( c1 INTEGER);
INSERT INTO t1(c1) VALUES (-1);

SELECT t1.c1 FROM t1; -- -1
SELECT (1 BETWEEN -1 AND CAST(CAST(t1.c1 AS BIT) AS INTEGER)) FROM t1; -- false
SELECT t1.c1 FROM t1 WHERE (1 BETWEEN -1 AND CAST(CAST(t1.c1 AS BIT) AS INTEGER));
-- Expected: empty
-- Actual: -1
```
