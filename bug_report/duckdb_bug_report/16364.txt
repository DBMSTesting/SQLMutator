Title: Aggregation: For dictionaries without an id - use the correct threshold to bail-out on using the dictionary
Description:
We should bail-out when `dict_size * DICTIONARY_THRESHOLD` is bigger than the number of rows in the chunk, not the other way around.

Note that in practice this code doesn't really get triggered right now because we only emit dictionary vectors with ids.
