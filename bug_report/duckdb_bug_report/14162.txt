Title: JSON extraction fail with error "Conversion Error: Failed to cast value to numerical"
Description:
### What happens?

While extracting field from JSON I get the error "Conversion Error: Failed to cast value to numerical" due to WHERE clause, but when adding some parenthesis to the clauses the error is gone. Seems to be a parser issue.
You can just check the "To Reproduce", I used on purpose the example from the duckdb documentation.
FYI this happens using python, nodejs, and linux CLI.

### To Reproduce

Setup from the doc https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/json#json-extraction-functions.
```sql
CREATE TABLE example (j JSON);
INSERT INTO example VALUES('{ "family": "anatidae", "species": [ "duck", "goose", "swan", null ] }');
```
Then when applying 2 from clauses like follow we get the error.
```sql
SELECT j->>'family' FROM example where j->>'family' in ('a') and j->>'family' in ('b');
```
But if we add some (), there are no more errors
```sql
SELECT j->>'family' FROM example where (j->>'family' in ('a')) and (j->>'family' in ('b'));
```
