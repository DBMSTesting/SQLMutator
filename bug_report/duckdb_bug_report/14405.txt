Title: `map_concat` does not handle a value with type `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` in a `on conflict ... do update set`
Description:
### What happens?

A seemingly valid query, with a column as `map<VARCHAR, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE>` is rejected when used with a `on conflict ... do update` clause.

> Invalid Input Error: 'value' type of map differs between arguments, expected 'MAP(INTEGER, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)', found 'MAP(VARCHAR, VARCHAR)' instead

### To Reproduce

I reproduce with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE map_ts (
      key VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
      ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
      int INTEGER
      ,map MAP(INTEGER, TIMESTAMPTZ)
);
```

then

```sql
-- OK
insert into map_ts (key, ts) values ('someKey', '1992-09-20 11:30:00.123456789') ;
-- KO
insert into map_ts (key, ts)  values ('someKey', '1992-09-20 11:30:00.123456789')  on conflict (key) do update set map = map_concat(EXCLUDED.map, MAP(['some_property'], ['1992-09-20 11:30:00.123456789']));
```
