Title: [TemporaryFileManager] Fix bug causing sizes of `.block` files to not be counted towards `max_temp_directory_size`
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2663

`TemporaryFileManager` manages the creation and resizing of `.tmp` files consisting of blocks of data with a fixed size.
`.block` files are created for anything that does not match this fixed block size, these are now properly counted towards the `size_on_disk` of the TemporaryFileManager.
