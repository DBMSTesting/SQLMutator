Title: Initialize create_index_info.catalog
Description:
`IndexBinder::BindCreateIndex` makes it easier for other `Catalog` implementors to implement `BindCreateIndex`.

However, it does not set the `catalog` field of the resulting `CreateIndexInfo`.
This PR fixes that by propagating the catalog name of the underlying table that the index is created from.


Note that `BindCreateIndex` can correctly handle cases where `create_index_info->catalog` is set and cases in which it is unset, as seen in
```
	auto &catalog = Catalog::GetCatalog(context, create_index_info->catalog);
```

I do not know of cases where `create_index_info->catalog` is set already when entering the method, but we could wrap my suggested change with an `if (info.catalog.emtpy())` branch for safety if you prefer.
