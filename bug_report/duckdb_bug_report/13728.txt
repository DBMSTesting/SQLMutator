Title: UNPIVOT and COLUMNS(varlist) don't work in a MACRO where varlist is a parameter
Description:
### What happens?

I want a MACRO that unpivots a table on a list of columns, passed as a variable.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE OR replace TABLE t1 AS SELECT 42 AS i, 84 AS j;
UNPIVOT t1 ON columns(['i','j']) ; -- ok
```
```sql
CREATE OR replace FUNCTION dummy(vars) AS TABLE (
	UNPIVOT t1 ON columns(vars) 
) ;

FROM dummy(['i','j']) ;
```

```console
Binder Error: No matching columns found that match regex "vars"
```

However these will work:

```sql
CREATE OR replace FUNCTION dummy2() AS TABLE (
	UNPIVOT t1 ON columns(['i','j']) 
) ;

FROM dummy2() ; -- ok
```
```sql
SET variable vars = ['i','j'] ;

CREATE OR replace FUNCTION dummy3() AS TABLE (
	UNPIVOT t1 ON columns(getvariable(vars)) 
) ;

FROM dummy3() ; -- ok
```
