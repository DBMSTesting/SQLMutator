Title: Not implemented Error: Comparison Type can't be an Arrow Scan Pushdown Filter
Description:
### What happens?

In 1.1.4-dev4815 I get a
```
Not implemented Error: Comparison Type can't be an Arrow Scan Pushdown Filter
```
when using a not equals comparison on a polars table in python. This works ok in 1.1.3.

### To Reproduce

```
import sys
import duckdb

print(sys.version)
print(f"Duckdb version: {duckdb.__version__}")

conn = duckdb.connect()
my_table = conn.query("select 'x' my_str").pl()
conn.close()

my_res = duckdb.query("select my_str from my_table where my_str != 'y'")

print(my_res)
```

Result (slightly redacted):
```
3.11.9 [...]
Duckdb version: 1.1.4-dev4815
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "[...].py", line 13, in <module>
    print(my_res)
duckdb.duckdb.NotImplementedException: Not implemented Error: Comparison Type can't be an Arrow Scan Pushdown Filter
