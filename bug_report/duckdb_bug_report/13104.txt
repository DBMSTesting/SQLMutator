Title: Macro default variable that is a boolean type fails
Description:
### What happens?

Howdy! This is a super tiny issue...

If a macro default variable is a boolean type, the macro will not successfully create. This may be caused by automatically re-writing the literal `true` into `cast('t' as boolean)`.

This is a tiny issue since integer values will perform adequately. The main downside is that the parameters are not as "self-documenting" that there are only 2 possible values.

### To Reproduce

This fails:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO default_bool_test(param1:=true) AS 
    CASE WHEN param1 THEN 'Tis true' ELSE 'Nope' END 
```
```
Parser Error: Invalid parameter: 'CAST('t' AS BOOLEAN)'
```

This succeeds:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO default_bool_test(param1:=1) AS 
    CASE WHEN param1 THEN 'Tis true' ELSE 'Nope' END 
```
