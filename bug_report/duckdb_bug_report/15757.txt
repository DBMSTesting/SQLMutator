Title: Absorb 2 wasm patches
Description:
Two unconnected simple changes:
* adding a default constructor to ClientProperties, given all it's properties are trivially constructible should be easy.
* c++17, used in the duckdb-wasm codebase, throws warnings that are better silenced (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/user_literal is not super clear, but `""` followed by space is deprecated, see section on 'Literal operators')
