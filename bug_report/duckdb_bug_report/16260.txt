Title: Changed behaviour of getvariable
Description:
### What happens?

with duckdb versions prior to version 1.1.3, i would run this command for ease of use:
`CREATE MACRO _(x) AS getvariable(x);`
so that i didn't have to write it each time,
but now on duckdb 1.2.0 i get back this error:
`Not implemented Error: getvariable requires a constant input`

1. is this expected?
2. is there a way to rename it, and in general, to rename functions such as `getvariable` ?



### To Reproduce

for reproducing, try this command on duckdb 1.1.3 and duckdb 1.2.0:
`CREATE MACRO _(x) AS getvariable(x);`
