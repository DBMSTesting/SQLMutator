Title: improve ReadAheadBuffer::AddReadHead error message
Description:
We had a user running into this error when dealing with a corrupted parquet file. It would be more helpful if ddb provided a bit more information on which file was corrupted etc. I made this change to provide more context on what went wrong in order to help users/developers debug this issue more effectively.
