Hi, referencing this [Issue](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/7384) that was closed.
Steps to reproduce error is the same as such I have copied over the steps.

The following error occurs when trying to access an fts index when using ATTACH for connection to a duckdb database file.
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

Did you mean "search_con.fts_main_my_table.terms"?
```

### To Reproduce

```py
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect("tester.db")
con.execute("CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT 1 AS CustomerId, 'hans' as CustomerName")
con.execute("PRAGMA create_fts_index(my_table, 'CustomerId', 'CustomerName')")
con.execute("SELECT fts_main_my_table.match_bm25(1, 'han')")
con.close()
con_2 = duckdb.connect()
con_2.execute("ATTACH 'tester.db' as search_con")
con_2.execute("SELECT search_con.fts_main_my_table.match_bm25(1, 'han')")
