Title: [CSV] Adaptive Sniffer
Description:
This PR introduces an adaptive sniffer that is used for multi-file reading.

Instead of always doing a full run of the CSV sniffer on every file, we use the information from the first file as a suggestion for the sniffer of all other files and run a lightweight version of the sniffer.

If the contents do not match, we will then run a full sniffer version on the new file.

I've also added a regression test for this:
