Title: Inconsistency between duckdb_settings() and duckdb_get_config_flag
Description:
### What happens?

As [discussed on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/909674491309850675/921073327009853451/1251263233827012720), when using the C Api to enumerate DuckDB configuration options, `duckdb_config_count` and `duckdb_get_config_flag` only return built-in options. On the other hand, `duckdb_settings()` will return options from an extension if they are already loaded.

### To Reproduce

Enumerate configuration options with `duckdb_get_config_flag` when some extension is already loaded and compare with `duckdb_settings()`
