Title: [PySpark] Add more functions such as slice, split, standard deviations, etc.
Description:
Some more functions for the Spark API. 

Next, I'll wait for the `WindowExpression` to land (https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/14725) after which I'm happy to implement the corresponding functions which need this such as [row_number](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.functions.row_number.html)
