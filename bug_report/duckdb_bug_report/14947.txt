Title: Improve code generation of storage and serialization version infos
Description:
* Add a DEFAULT_xxxx_VERSION_INFO
* Add an optional (if 'latest' is present) LATEST_xxxx_VERSION_INFO
* Align content of json file and cpp file (!!)
* Add default value in the json file
* Skip clang formatting
* Add check to generate-files (also used in CI)

Generated code is basically the same, but would need to be properly double-checked.
