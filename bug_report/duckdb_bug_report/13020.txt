Title: Add sha1(varchar) -> varchar scalar function
Description:
This adds a new `sha1` built-in function, whose implementation is copy-paste-modified from the existing `sha256` function implementation.

Having a sha1 function as a duckdb core function will give some of my projects a ~100x speedup, as I will be able to avoid the overhead of calling into a Python implementation of that function.
