Title: String to struct problem
Description:
### What happens?

We have a CSV file with a string column which in fact contains a struct.
We want to convert this string to a struct. This works fine except when the value of one of the column contains a single quote.

Is there a solution/workaround how to represent the string in column c2 when it should contain a single quote (escape it, ...)?

### To Reproduce

**Input CSV file (`test_struct.csv`), first line is the header**
```
input
"{'c1':1, 'c2':'erik'}"
"{'c1':1, 'c2':'er\"ik'}"
"{'c1':1, 'c2':'er''ik'}"
"{'c1':1, 'c2':'er'ik'}"
```

**SQL statement**
```sql
select *, try_cast(input as struct(c1 integer, c2 varchar)) from 'test_struct.csv';
```

**SQL Result**
```
input                    TRY_CAST("input" AS STRUCT(c1 INTEGER, c2 VARCHAR))
-----------------------  ---------------------------------------------------
{'c1':1, 'c2':'erik'}    {'c1': 1, 'c2': erik}                              
{'c1':1, 'c2':'er"ik'}   {'c1': 1, 'c2': er"ik}                             
{'c1':1, 'c2':'er''ik'}  {'c1': 1, 'c2': er''ik}                            
{'c1':1, 'c2':'er'ik'}                                  
```

**Note: you can try without reading from a csv file as well:**

```sql
-- result of try cast is null
select '{c1:1, c2:er''ik}' as s, try_cast(s as struct(c1 integer, c2 varchar)) as t, {c1:1, c2: 'er''ik'} as u;

-- result of try cast again is null
select '{c1:1, c2:''er''ik''}' as s, try_cast(s as struct(c1 integer, c2 varchar)) as t, {c1:1, c2: 'er''ik'} as u;

-- result of try cast is not null but we do get 2 single quotes instead of one
select '{c1:1, c2:''er''''ik''}' as s, try_cast(s as struct(c1 integer, c2 varchar)) as t, {c1:1, c2: 'er''ik'} as u;

```
