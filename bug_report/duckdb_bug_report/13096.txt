Title: DuckDB crash on UNION ALL statement with > 350 SELECT's
Description:
### What happens?

A statement like:

```
SELECT 1
UNION ALL
SELECT 2
UNION ALL
...
UNION ALL
SELECT 350
```

executes as expected. But add one more SELECT and DuckDB crashes. It doesn't give any error message, it just terminates and throws me back into the host. 

It does not appear to have anything todo with the size of the individual SELECTs, just with whehter there are more than 350 of them unioned together.

This does not happen on the GA release, but it happens on the nightly build (duckdb_cli-windows-amd64 /  v1.0.1-dev3170 18254ec5d9)

### To Reproduce

I'm attaching two files - 350_union_all.sql.txt which works, and 351_union_all.sql.txt, which crashes DuckDB
