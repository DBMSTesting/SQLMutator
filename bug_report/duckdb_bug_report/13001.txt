Title: Improve error messages in the presence of subqueries
Description:
Fixes #12988

This PR improves error messages in the presence of subqueries, in particular missing columns. When there are subqueries, we run multiple bind phases, and in case of a failure each of these bind phases produces an error message. Choosing which error message is appropriate is non-trivial. We used to always take the "outer-most" error message, but that can produce confusing error messages.

In this PR we rework the error messages so that:
* Unsupported operators (e.g. window functions in a lateral join) first bind the child expressions, and prefer to throw errors found there
* Missing column errors are combined, providing the best candidates found across the possible table names instead of only at the outer layer

For example:

```sql
CALL dbgen(sf=0);


SELECT * FROM orders, (SELECT SUM(l_returnfla) FROM lineitem) t2;
-- v1.0:  LATERAL join cannot contain aggregates!
-- New: Referenced column "l_returnfla" not found in FROM clause!

SELECT (SELECT l_returnfla FROM lineitem) FROM orders;
-- Binder Error: Referenced column "l_returnfla" not found in FROM clause!
-- v1.0: Candidate bindings: "orders.o_clerk"
-- New: Candidate bindings: "lineitem.l_returnflag", "lineitem.l_receiptdate", "lineitem.l_orderkey", "lineitem.l_linestatus", "orders.o_orderdate"
```
