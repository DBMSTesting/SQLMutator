Title: [Python][Dev] Fix issues with new/updated tests in the python sqllogictest implementation
Description:
This PR fixes the failing python sqllogictest nightly-test run

Almost all of these are very benign, there is one adjustment I had to make that made me raise an eyebrow.
Possibly pointing to a problem in the C++ API ?

In `test/sql/attach/attach_export_import.test` I've had to add a `drop view integers_view` statement to get the test to pass on the python sqllogictester, which makes me wonder: why does the C++ variant not run into this same problem?

Or is the error somehow getting swallowed?
