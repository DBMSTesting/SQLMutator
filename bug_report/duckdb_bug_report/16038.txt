Title: Fix gcc 4.8 compilation
Description:
This reverts commit f6e185866cd535433c6cb7a8ec86bf56df06b032 (also of mine).

This is needed since the new syntax (that deprecates the old one) is not supported by GCC 4.8 (or maybe there is some flag that can be passed, but not worth the effort)

Note that this (if test is enabled) shows quite some compilation warning that we might want to address, mostly uninitialized member initializations.
