Title: Run the Regression GitHub Action on an ARM processor
Description:
Try speeding up a long running GitHub Action by running it on an ARM processor.
[Standard GitHub-hosted runners for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories) --> `os: ubuntu-24.04-arm`

This might not be a great example because the `build` step takes the bulk of the time and the cache (hendrikmuhs/ccache-action@main) is invalid because of the change of processor and the cache save being set to `false`.
