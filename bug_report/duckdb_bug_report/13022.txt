Title: Brand new Extension threw an exception: "Missing DB manager" in python
Description:
### What happens?

I am trying to start developing my own extension.
I followed the procedure from duckdb extension template: created my own git repo "quack2" from template, cloned, built... no extra code involved yet

Tried ./duckdb -unsigned, 
Installed extension from file, loaded, all ok.

Then all interesting started from trying to load it in python.

On load_extension part getting Segmentation fault (core dumped) , of course hard way, no try and catch in help.

Please look at it please

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb
import os

con = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:', read_only=False, config={'allow_unsigned_extensions': 'true', 'allow_extensions_metadata_mismatch': 'true'})

try:
    con.execute(f"install 'extension/quack2/quack2.duckdb_extension';")
    con.load_extension('quack2')
    print("Extension loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to load extension: {e}")
```
