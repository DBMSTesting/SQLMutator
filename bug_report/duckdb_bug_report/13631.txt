Title: Add script for testing backwards compatibility of plan serialization, and fix serialization issues
Description:
This PR adds a script that can be used for testing backwards compatibility of the query plan format. The script can be invoked as follows:

```bash
python3 scripts/test_serialization_bwc.py --old-source ../duckdb-bugfix --test-file test/sql/aggregate/aggregates/test_median.test
```

We need two binaries:
* the `unittest` program of the old version of the system (e.g. v1.0)
* the `unittest` program of the new version of the system

The script then uses the Python SQLLogicTester (CC @Tishj) to extract the statements from the target test file, grouping them into either (1) `db_load.sql`, or (2) `queries.sql`.

The script then uses the old unittest program to generate the serialized plans by running the `"Generate serialized plans file"` test. It then copies over the serialized plans generated with the old binary to the new unittester, and runs the `"Test deserialized plans from file"` test. This test verifies that the deserialized plans have the same results as running the queries directly.

# Fixed Serialization Issues

This PR also fixes serialization issues with `quantile`, `median` and `printf` that were introduced by removing overloads in previous PRs. The removal of these unnecessary overloads works fine normally because the `bind` phase will promote the types. However, the serialized plans maintain the old types internally, and hence we must keep these old overloads around.
