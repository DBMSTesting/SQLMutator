Title: [Fix] Fix truncate + FK internal exception and another index bug
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3893.

I've also tried moving the delete indexes into the FK constraint verification. There are a few first steps, mostly pushing the `LocalTableStorage` to where it is needed. The same was already done for functions such as the following.
```cpp
static void VerifyUniqueIndexes(TableIndexList &indexes, optional_ptr<LocalTableStorage> storage, DataChunk &chunk,
	                                optional_ptr<ConflictManager> manager);
```


However, the verification would be outside this PR's scope, and the code to populate the delete indexes with the respective values is still missing.

There's also a bit of code tidying here and there, as the foreign key code has not seen much love recently.
