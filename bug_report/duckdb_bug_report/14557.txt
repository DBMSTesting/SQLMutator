Title: [Dev] Make the `regression_test_runner` easier to replicate
Description:
- Moved the benchmark running logic out into `regression/benchmark.py`, so it can be run stand-alone with a single runner
- Moved the remainder of the logic in `regression_test_runner.py` to `regression/test_runner.py`, importing `benchmark.py`
- Used `argparse` in both of these to simplify CLI argument parsing logic and make it easier to extend in the future.
