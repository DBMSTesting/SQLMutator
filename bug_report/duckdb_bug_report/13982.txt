Title: Bugfixes
Description:
Fixes:
1. https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3041 - Recurse into materialized CTE definitions in `FilterPushdown`.
2. #13850 - Disable auto-CTE materialization when one or more of the CTEs in the query are manually materialized.
3. #13948 - Use JSONPath instead of JSONPointer to resolve JSON extracts that do no explicitly begin with a `$` or `/`, and also implement a special case for when the extract argument is integral (array extract). This more closely matches PostgreSQL behavior.
4. #13938 - Reset `chunk` in `PhysicalPieceWiseMergeJoin` if it has a cardinality of 0 (it may have been sliced before, changing the vectors to Dictionary, which messes up a `Reference` when filling Left/Outer join NULLs).

I've also tweaked the `CardinalityEstimator` to fix a regression to TPC-H Q9 introduced when going from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0.

EDIT: I've also tweaked some allocation settings so that we are less likely to OOM when running large queries on small hardware.
