Title: [Arrow][Python] Don't produce Extension data types when outputting to Polars
Description:
This PR fixes #13967 

[Recently](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13446) we added support for Arrow canonical extension types, Polars does not support these, so we disable producing ArrowSchema objects with metadata when outputting to polars

- Moved `ArrowUtil` out of `arrow_wrapper.hpp/cpp` into `arrow_util.hpp/cpp`
- Moved the ArrowSchema constructor logic out of `arrow_converter.hpp/cpp`, into `arrow_schema_constructor.hpp/cpp`
- Changed `ArrowConverter::ToArrowSchema`' first parameter from a pointer to a reference, it was being asserted to be non-null already.
- Added `add_metadata` to `ArrowSchemaConstructor` and `ArrowConverter::ToArrowSchema`, this is set to false for `pl()`
