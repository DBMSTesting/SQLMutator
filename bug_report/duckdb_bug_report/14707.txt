Title: COPY … TO with hive partitioning behavior inconsistency between CSV and PARQUET formats and with the documentation
Description:
### What happens?

By using COPY … TO with PARTITION_BY and without WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS options we don’t get rid of partitions fields with PARQUET as we do with CSV.

### To Reproduce

```
COPY (
	SELECT
		1 AS foo, 
		2024 AS year,
		11 AS month,
		5 AS day
) TO '.' (
	FORMAT PARQUET,
	OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE,
	PARTITION_BY (year, month, day),
	FILENAME_PATTERN 'test'
);
```
We get the following file content (with partitioning fields):
```
foo|day|month|year|
---+---+-----+----+
  1|  5|   11|2024|
```
If we choose CSV instead of PARQUET, we get the expected result (without partitioning fields):
```
foo
1
```
According to the documentation (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/copy.html, version 1.1), WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS is a Boolean option, I should  be able to use it with a true or false value.
With the following options:
```
	FORMAT CSV,
	OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE,
	PARTITION_BY (year, month, day),
	WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS false,
	FILENAME_PATTERN 'test'
```
I get the same result with WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS set to true or false:
```
foo|year|month|day|
---+----+-----+---+
  1|2024|   11|  5|
```
With WRITE_PARTITION_COLUMNS set to false, I would expect to get rid of partition fields (like when this option is absent).
