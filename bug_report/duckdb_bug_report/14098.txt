Title: `AT TIME ZONE` no longer supports a timezone number (i.e. `-0400`) which used to work on v1.0.0
Description:
### What happens?

I can no longer do something like `nested.date AT TIME ZONE nested.timezone` where `nested.timezone` is `-0400`. It used to work on v1.0.0, but on v1.1.0 I get:

```
Not implemented Error: Unknown TimeZone '-0400'
```

### To Reproduce

Try `<date> AT TIME ZONE <timezone>` where `timezone` is `-0400` or any other numeric timezone
