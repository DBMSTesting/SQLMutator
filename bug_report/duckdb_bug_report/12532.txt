Title: Add support for `arg_min(ANY, ANY)`
Description:
Follow-up from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12525

This PR uses the new sort key implementation to add support for `arg_min(ANY, ANY)` (and friends), so that any type including composite types can be used as both key and value, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE TABLE structs AS SELECT i, {'i': i} s FROM range(100000000) t(i);
D SELECT arg_min(s, s) AS result FROM structs;
┌──────────────────┐
│      result      │
│ struct(i bigint) │
├──────────────────┤
│ {'i': 0}         │
└──────────────────┘

```
