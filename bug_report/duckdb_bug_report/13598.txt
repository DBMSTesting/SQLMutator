Title: Window range ending in `0 preceding` invalid result
Description:
### What happens?

Running a window function with upper limit `0 preceding` excludes the current row and produces identical results to when running with `1 preceding`.

### To Reproduce

```sql
select x, sum(x) over (order by x range between 5 preceding and 1 preceding) as y from (select unnest(range(10)) as x);
select x, sum(x) over (order by x range between 5 preceding and 0 preceding) as y from (select unnest(range(10)) as x);
```

These look identical. I would expect `out2` to include the current row's `x` in its sum.
