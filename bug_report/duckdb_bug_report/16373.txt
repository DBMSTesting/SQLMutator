Title: regression: TABLESAMPLE does not respect seed when using `system` method
Description:
### What happens?

```sql
SET threads = 1;
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test AS SELECT UNNEST(RANGE(100000)) as x;
SELECT COUNT(*), min(x) FROM test TABLESAMPLE system (25 PERCENT) REPEATABLE (42);
# (32416, 0)
# (18432, 0)
# (28320, 2048)
# (24224, 0)
# (24224, 2048)
```

However, if I replace the `system` method with `bernoulii` or `reservoir`, then the results are reproducible.

This appears to be a regression in 1.2.0. In Duckdb version 1.1.3 and before, the results are consistent.
