Title: insert into ... on conflict, select fails in transaction
Description:
### What happens?

When doing a conflicting INSERT with following SELECT in a transaction block, an internal error is raised.
This happens when a UNIQUE constraint is violated. The transaction aborts with the following error as soon as the SELECT statement has been read.

```
INTERNAL Error: No rows in LocalTableStorage row group for scan
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```

### To Reproduce

```
create table tbl (a short primary key, b short, unique(b));
insert into tbl(a, b) values(1, 2);

begin transaction;
insert into tbl(a, b) values(1, 2) on conflict do nothing;
select * from tbl where a = 1;
```

At this point, the above error is raised and the db, if opened from file, must be reopened.
