Title: Support indexes in `COPY DATABASE`
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12329

This PR implements support for indexes in `COPY DATABASE`. It also cleans up index creation by moving everything that is required to create an index into the `DuckIndexEntry` constructor - previously this would not correctly instantiate the index fully which is why this was unsupported to begin with.
