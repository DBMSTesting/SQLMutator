Title: [MultiFileReader] Extend support for column mapping from local -> global column
Description:
This PR essentially moves the specialized code that was already in the parquet extension for matching on `field_id`, added by <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/9123>, into the MultiFileReader.

It also makes it possible to map a local (per-file) column name to a different global name.

To do this we bundle the type+name into a struct (`MultiFileReaderColumnDefinition`), where we can also bundle additional metadata like default values, and the parquet field_id
