Title: Nocase and in clause
Description:
### What happens?

Using version 1.1.3 I execute the following statement:

```
SET default_collation = NOCASE;

select *
from (
                select 1 as A, 'Removed' as ds
                union
                Select 2 as A, 'REMOVED' as ds
                ) t
where ds in (
                select 'Removed' as ds -- It does not select the second record even though I set default_collation = NOCASE;
                );             
select *
from (
                select 1 as A, 'Removed' as ds
                union
                Select 2 as A, 'REMOVED' as ds
                ) t
where ds ='Removed'; -- in this case it works correctly
```
This is a simplified scenario, it took me several days to understand this rounding problem in my more complex scenario.

### To Reproduce

```
SET default_collation = NOCASE;

select *
from (
                select 1 as A, 'Removed' as ds
                union
                Select 2 as A, 'REMOVED' as ds
                ) t
where ds in (
                select 'Removed' as ds -- It does not select the second record even though I set default_collation = NOCASE;
                );             
select *
from (
                select 1 as A, 'Removed' as ds
                union
                Select 2 as A, 'REMOVED' as ds
                ) t
where ds ='Removed'; -- in this case it works correctly
```
