Title: Fix partitions on wide tables
Description:
On main branch, `Tables.partitions` fails on table with more than 10 columns. The (somewhat convoluted) reason is that julia `ntuple` function when fed a `UInt64` as second argument, casts it to `Int` only if it is `<= 10` (see https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/55790). This works in our favor for small `n` (number of columns), as the function `ColumnConversionData` expects a `Int`, not a `UInt64`, but for larger `n` attempting to collect a `Tables.partitions` fails.

The first commits is a minimal fix + test, whereas the second commit also adds a small refactor to simplify code and make it more robust to this.
