Title: [Dev] Clean up TreeRenderer code
Description:
This PR is doing some yak-shaving in preparation of introducing JSON as a formatting option to the EXPLAIN statement.

I have separated RenderTree from the TreeRenderer, and have moved all tree-creation related methods to the RenderTree class.
I've also removed raw pointers in favor of `optional_ptr`, `unique_ptr<....>[]` in favor of `unique_array` and replaced a `vector<pair<idx_t, idx_t>>` with a struct in place of the `pair`.

## Future work

- Introduce the TreeRenderer interface
- Rename the existing TreeRenderer into TextTreeRenderer
- Add `JSONTreeRenderer` as a new implementation of the Interface
- Add support for `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)`, using the new JSONTreeRenderer
