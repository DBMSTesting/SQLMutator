Title: Read multiple copies of CSV file larger than`CSV_MINIMUM_BUFFER_SIZE` bytes gives "INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference shared_ptr that is NULL!"
Description:
### What happens?

Loading multiple copies of a particular CSV file with non-ASCII characters gives an internal error. The error vanishes if:

- not enough copies are loaded
- the file size is reduced below `CSV_MINIMUM_BUFFER_SIZE` (8e6)
    - verified by compiling with this value reduced to 8e5, now much smaller files are needed to reproduce the crash
- certain columns are omitted from the CSV file (no pattern detected)
    - by editing the file, did not try other options for `read_csv_auto()`
- the file uses commas instead of semicolons
    - via `gsed -i 's/;/,/g' data-small.csv`  
- a different CSV file is used
    - tried the much larger https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data which presumably has only ASCII characters

### To Reproduce

```
#!/bin/sh

set -e

if ! [ -f "data.csv" ]; then
  curl -o data.csv -L https://data.sbb.ch/api/v2/catalog/datasets/dienststellen-gemass-opentransportdataswiss/exports/csv?use_labels=true
fi

# Strip at 8001000 characters (larger than CSV_MINIMUM_BUFFER_SIZE)
# Include only full lines
head -c 8001000 data.csv | ghead -n -1 > data-small.csv

echo "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_csv(['data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv'])" | tee /dev/stderr | duckdb
```

### Output

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_csv(['data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv', 'data-small.csv'])
INTERNAL Error:
Attempted to dereference shared_ptr that is NULL!
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
