Title: improve extension error message
Description:
Closes #13808 
This PR improves the error message when failing to install or load a duckdb extension. 

Mainly, it gets rid of the `Extension \"" + extension_name + "\" is an existing extension.\n.` error message created by `ExtensionHelper::CreateSuggestions` when the given candidate is an exact match.

Before:
* When there's an exact match for the given extension, mutate message to include `Extension \"" + extension_name + "\" is an existing extension.\n`. **This is confusing as part of the error message.**
* When there is no exact match, mutate `message` to include alternative extension candidates using `StringUtil::CandidatesMessage`.

```
E       duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Failed to download extension "iceberg" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.0.0/linux_amd64_gcc4/iceberg.duckdb_extension.gz"
E       Extension "iceberg" is an existing extension.
E        (ERROR Connection)
```

After:
* When there's an exact match for the given extension, there's no need to suggest candidate extensions. `message` is not mutated
* When there is no exact match, mutate `message` to include alternative extension candidates using `StringUtil::CandidatesMessage`.
```

### Context
The `CreateSuggestions` function returns a boolean and also mutates the input `message` string. The function is used to suggest similar extension candidates in case of a typo. `CreateSuggestions` is called in by [`InstallFromHttpUrl`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/64bacde85e4c24134cf73f9b4ed3ae362510f287/src/main/extension/extension_install.cpp#L423) and [`TryInitialLoad`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/1d3fc5aec6b846c563d6d99c96df7c30117b5a94/src/main/extension/extension_load.cpp#L341). A `message` parameter is passed in to `CreateSuggestions` to add extra context and to suggest alternative extension candidates.

### Test
To build
```
OVERRIDE_GIT_DESCRIBE=v1.1.0 GEN=ninja make
```
Using `v1.1.0` here to ensure that extension installation will fail since `v1.1.0` is not yet released.
