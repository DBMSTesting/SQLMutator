Title: `exists` Keyword not Working on AArch64 Linux
Description:
### What happens?

I downloaded duckdb_cli-linux-aarch64.zip from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v1.1.2, and then executed the following SQL query multiple times:

```sql
select count(*)
from range(1000, 3000) as a(v), range(1000, 3000) as b(v)
where exists (select a.v != b.v);
```

Each time the query resulted in different outcomes, as shown in the screenshots below:

I have only encountered this issue on the AArch64 version of the *Linux* system; testing on the AArch64 version of *macOS* did not reveal any problems.

### To Reproduce

```sql
select count(*)
from range(1000, 3000) as a(v), range(1000, 3000) as b(v)
where exists (select a.v != b.v);
```
