Title: normalize_names does not work properly with `/dev/stdin`
Description:
### What happens?

Hi,
if I apply `normalize_names` to `/dev/stdin` duckdb normalizes the field `text` to `_text`.

It should remain `text`.







### To Reproduce

To reproduce

```
printf "name,text\nJohn,ipsum\n" | duckdb -line -c "select * from read_csv_auto('/dev/stdin',normalize_names=true);"
```

It gives in output

```
_name = John
_text = ipsum
```
