Title: Summarize gives Out of Range Error due to inf/-inf 
Description:
### What happens?

`SUMMARIZE <table>` results in `STDDEV_SAMP is out of range!` error if any column contains an inf value. 

This occurs for any stddev, variance, regr_r2, etc function. 

** Would prefer to see null values or inf values or something *else* other than an exception. 

### To Reproduce

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE abc as 
SELECT 1/0 as someinfvalue, -1/0 as otherinfvalue, 'foo' as anotherval
UNION ALL SELECT 2 as someinfvalue, 3 as otherinfvalue, 'foo' as anotherval
;

SUMMARIZE abc;
```

Similarly, this would occur with: 
```sql
SELECT stddev(someinfvalue) 
FROM abc
```

This, of course, also happens with variance, regr_r2, etc.
