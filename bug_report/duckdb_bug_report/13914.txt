Title: malloc heap corruption when reading and writing to parquet
Description:
### What happens?

I'm reading some data from overturemaps filtering and writing to parquet, and I get the following error

```
python3.11(19247,0x170583000) malloc: Heap corruption detected, free list is damaged at 0x600001d2df40
*** Incorrect guard value: 4736766904
python3.11(19247,0x170583000) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
zsh: abort      ipython
