Title: COPY FROM not allowing union_by_name=True and not checking the schema from table
Description:
### What happens?

I am trying to run a COPY FROM command to pull data from Parquet files in S3 and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The S3 directory contains multiple files.

I am encountering the following error:
```
failed to cast column <column_name> from type INTEGER to VARCHAR[]: Unimplemented type for cast (INTEGER -> VARCHAR[])
```

Additionally
```
This can happen when reading multiple Parquet files. The schema information is taken from the first Parquet file by default. Possible solutions:
* Enable the union_by_name=True option to combine the schema of all Parquet files (duckdb.org/docs/data/multiple_files/combining_schemas)
* Use a COPY statement to automatically derive types from an existing table.
```

### To Reproduce

1. Create a set of Parquet files using a CREATE TABLE command in Athena.
2. Attach a PostgreSQL instance to DuckDB.
3. Run a COPY FROM command similar to the following:
```
COPY <db>.<schema>.<table_name>
FROM '{s3_location}' (FORMAT PARQUET);
```


Issue : 
There is no way to add union_by_name=True to the COPY FROM command, and this is already a COPY command.
