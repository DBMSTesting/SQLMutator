Title: Provide support for continuous profiling
Description:
DuckDB's profiler gives excellent insights into where time is being spent in a long-running query. It currently only exposes this information at the end of query execution, though. The PR here makes it possible to get profile information while the query is executing, providing a way to make this information externally visible during query execution (similar to query progress).
