Title: Limit the maximum number of vacuum tasks launched during a checkpoint, configurable through `max_vacuum_tasks`
Description:
Currently the vacuum tasks do not yet do optimistic writing, which can lead to large memory (or temp disk) usage if many vacuum jobs are performed at once. This should ideally be resolved differently in the future, but this adds a toggle that can limit the impact of this problem.
