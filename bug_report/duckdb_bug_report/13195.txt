Title: EXPLAIN output not working/ not similar to docs
Description:
### What happens?

When I tried to use the `EXPLAIN` keyword the output does not give me any numbers or anything that looks similar to what is shown in the docs.

### To Reproduce

When I try to reproduce the example in https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/profiling.html

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect(database=":memory:")

query = """
SET explain_output = 'all';

CREATE TABLE students (name VARCHAR, sid INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE exams (eid INTEGER, subject VARCHAR, sid INTEGER);
INSERT INTO students VALUES ('Mark', 1), ('Joe', 2), ('Matthew', 3);
INSERT INTO exams VALUES (10, 'Physics', 1), (20, 'Chemistry', 2), (30, 'Literature', 3);
EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM students JOIN exams USING (sid) WHERE name LIKE 'Ma%';
"""

data = con.sql(query=query).df()
print(data)
```

this is what I see

```bash
     explain_key                                      explain_value
0   logical_plan  ┌───────────────────────────┐                 ...
1    logical_opt  ┌───────────────────────────┐                 ...
2  physical_plan  ┌───────────────────────────┐                 ...
```

This is not at all what I see in the docs
