Title: DuckDB version mismatch when building extensions
Description:
### What happens?

We are in an air tight environment and to use the extensions, we need to build from source which normally get downloaded. 

I can build the extension but it keeps coming up with an error that the version the extension doesn't match the version of DuckDB. I can get the target architecture right but not the version. 

```
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: Failed to load 'POSTGRES', The file was built specifically for DuckDB version 'ef50246314' and can only be loaded with that version of DuckDB. (this version of DuckDB is 'v1.2.0')
```

I am trying everything to get the version to match but without any success. It would be good to show how this works in simple steps in the documentation.




### To Reproduce

Here are the steps that I followed (I don't normally code in c++ so this may be a bit off)

1. Get the correct versions
```shell
git submodule init
git pull --recurse-submodules

cd duckdb && git checkout v1.2.0
cd ..

cd extension-ci-tools && git checkout v1.2.0
cd ..
```

2. Build the extension
```shell
GEN=ninja TARGET_DUCKDB_VERSION=v1.2.0 DUCKDB_GIT_VERSION=v1.2.0 DUCKDB_PLATFORM=linux_amd64_gcc4 make release
```

3. To test, copied over the built extension into folder /workspace on a Python 3.9 docker image
```python
import duckdb

# "allow_extensions_metadata_mismatch": "true"
con = duckdb.connect(config = {"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"})
con.install_extension("/workspace/postgres_scanner.duckdb_extension")
con.load_extension("/workspace/postgres_scanner/postgres_scanner.duckdb_extension")

con.sql('PRAGMA platform').show()

con.sql('from duckdb_extensions()').show()

con.sql("ATTACH 'dbname=app user=postgres password=hello123 host=postgres' AS db (TYPE POSTGRES, SCHEMA 'public')")

con.sql("SELECT 42").show()
```
