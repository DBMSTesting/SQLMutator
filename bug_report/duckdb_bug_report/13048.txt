Title: Julia - Only commit transaction on non-error
Description:
This removes an extra error `Execute of query "COMMIT TRANSACTION;" failed: TransactionContext Error: cannot commit - no transaction is active` that would be thrown when an error occurs within the try block and the transaction needs to be rolled back.
