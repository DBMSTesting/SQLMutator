Title: [Dev] Split last part of `ColumnDataCheckpointer::Checkpoint` into `FinalizeCheckpoint`
Description:
This PR doesn't change any behavior yet, it's just yak-shaving for a future PR

We want to potentially reference the base data during the scan when checkpointing the validity.
Currently base data is taken out, checkpointed and replaced before validity gets checkpointed, making this impossible.

The checkpoint process currently takes ownership of the old base data, it does so because it will reuse that data if the base data hasn't undergone any changes.
This step of the process has been moved to `FinalizeCheckpoint`, allowing us to `Checkpoint` both base data and validity data before moving on to `FinalizeCheckpoint`.

These steps are currently bundled:
```
Checkpoint(base)
FinalizeCheckpoint(std::move(base))
Checkpoint(validity)
FinalizeCheckpoint(std::move(validity))
```

In a future PR we can change the order:
```
Checkpoint(base)
Checkpoint(validity)
FinalizeCheckpoint(std::move(base))
FinalizeCheckpoint(std::move(validity))
```
