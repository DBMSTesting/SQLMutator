Title: `OR`/`IN` filter pushdown for `VARCHAR`
Description:
This was only implemented for integral types, so this PR adds support for strings (also works for dynamic join filter pushdown!).

To prevent regressions in IMDB, I had to add a special case for `OPTIONAL_FILTER`s in `row_group.cpp` so that these are skipped for scanning vectors (they are only used for row group checking anyway).
