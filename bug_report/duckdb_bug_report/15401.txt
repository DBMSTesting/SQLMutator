Title: allow multifilereaders to delete entire chunks in FinalizeChunk
Description:
Fix for multifilereaders that delete every row in a chunk in the FinalizeChunk step. Currently when a MultiFileReader deletes every row, the row group may be abandoned prematurely because the Parquet scan loop will assume the row group is fully scanned even though it is not. 

Have no easy way to test this in DuckDB but I have a test in the Delta extension that confirms this fixes the issue.
