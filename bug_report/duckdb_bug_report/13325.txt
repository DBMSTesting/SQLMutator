Title: Copying a parquet with nano timestamps degrade the timestamp to micros. 
Description:
### What happens?

Hello,

When using `copy to`, duckdb degrade the `timestamp_utc` field from nanos to micros.  
This does not happen with a parquet generated with duckdb or pyarrow.  

Note: In the issue template, the link to the DuckDB Arrow extension lead to a 404.

### To Reproduce

Parquet file: [data.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16512584/data.zip)

```sql
copy (select * from "data.parquet") to 'duckdb.parquet' (format parquet);
```
In my parquet sample, the metadata shows:  
```json
"Children": [
      {
        "Path": "timestamp_utc",
        "Type": "INT64",
        "TypeLength": null,
        "LogicalType": {
          "Name": "TIMESTAMP",
          "IsAdjustedToUTC": true,
          "Unit": "NANOS"
        },
        "RepetitionType": "OPTIONAL",
        "ConvertedType": "",
        "Children": []
      }
    ]
```

DuckDB generated parquet:
```json
"Children": [
      {
        "Path": "timestamp_utc",
        "Type": "INT64",
        "TypeLength": null,
        "LogicalType": {
          "Name": "TIMESTAMP",
          "IsAdjustedToUTC": true,
          "Unit": "MICROS"
        },
        "RepetitionType": "OPTIONAL",
        "ConvertedType": "TIMESTAMP_MICROS",
        "Children": []
      }
    ]
```
