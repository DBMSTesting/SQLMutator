Title: UDF (user-defined function) calling SQL freezes process
Description:
### What happens?

It is apparently not possible to invoke SQL in a user-defined function, although no error is produced. The following script gets stuck and never produces any output.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect()

con.sql("create table Node (NodeNo integer primary key)")
con.sql("insert into Node values (0)")

def validate_node(NodeNo: int) -> bool:
    res = con.sql("select 1 from Node N where N.NodeNo = {NodeNo}").fetchall()
    return len(res) == 1

con.create_function("validate_node", validate_node)

print(con.sql("select validate_node(0)"))

con.close()
```
