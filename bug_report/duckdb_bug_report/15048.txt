Title: Add `require ram` to test runner, and use to limit distinct_grouping_tpch.test
Description:
This adds the following `require` syntax to the sqllogic test runner:

```sql
require ram 4gb
```

Certain Github Actions machines have a very limited amount of RAM and disk space available, leading to test failures (particularly in combination with `verify_external`).
