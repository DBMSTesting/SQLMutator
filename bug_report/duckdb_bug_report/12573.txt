Title: Feature #1272: Window Executor State 
Description:
This is going to be a large change, so I am breaking it down into smaller PRs to make code reviewing easier.
This first PR is just code motion - moving hash group global state out of the aggregators into dedicated objects.

* Factor out global state into global state objects in preparation for multithreaded building.
* Refactor per-thread WindowAggregator state into a WindowAggregatorState
* Initialise WindowAggregator with the argument types, not a DataChunk containing them.
* Move WindowConstantAggregator's global state into its own global state object
* Move WindowCustomAggregator's global state into its own global state object
* Move WindowDistinctAggregator's global state into its own global state object
* Move WindowSegmentTree's global state into its own global state object
* Move WindowNaiveAggregator's global state into its own global state object
* Move stateless executors to the global sink state.
