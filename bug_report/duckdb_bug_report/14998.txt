Title: Run containerized builds requiring deprecatd ACTIONS_ALLOW_USE_UNSECURE_NODE_VERSION only on main/feature
Description:
Idea for this PR is avoiding some noise in CI and the potential confusion to DuckDB contributors.

For additional context:
* Using `container:` implies all actions are run within a given containerized image
* for security & maintenance reasons, actions are required to use recent tooling
* eventually those tools (like node 20) will not be supported on images such as manylinux_2014

Solution is running the dockerized parts piece-by-piece, while interacting with actions at the `native` layer.

This has been worked on in the duckdb/extension-ci-tools repository, via https://github.com/duckdb/extension-ci-tools/pull/79 and subsequent PRs, now we need to port this to duckdb/duckdb.

This PR only avoid the noise in CI, given those workflow will fail without fix, I don't see much value in running them at all.

Proper fix to be rolled piece-by-piece, Python for example will be eventually solved via: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14987, where this part has then to be reverted.
