Title: Window Task Scheduling: avoid blocking tasks during GETDATA
Description:
Blocking tasks during `GETDATA` means we can have one thread blocking, while another thread returns a chunk. This can lead to issues as control might never be returned to `PhysicalWindow::GetData` if the operator is short-circuited due to e.g. a `LIMIT` clause. To ensure this does not happen we only block during the other phases (`SINK`, `FINALIZE`).
