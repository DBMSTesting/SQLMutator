Title: C API header generation for Go bindings
Description:
This PR extends the C API generation script with Go API header generation capacities.
The idea is to (eventually) support a lightweight Go package wrapping the C API bindings in Go types/functions/etc.

Now, the script generates the following list of files.
```py
# The main C header. This is what to include when linking with DuckDB through the C API.
 DUCKDB_HEADER_OUT_FILE_NAME = 'duckdb.h'
 DUCKDB_HEADER_OUT_FILE = 'src/include/' + DUCKDB_HEADER_OUT_FILE_NAME
 # The main C header excluding all functions.
 DUCKDB_HEADER_BASE_OUT_FILE_NAME = 'duckdb_base.h'
 DUCKDB_HEADER_BASE_OUT_FILE = 'src/include/' + DUCKDB_HEADER_BASE_OUT_FILE_NAME
 # The header to be included by DuckDB C extensions.
 DUCKDB_HEADER_C_OUT_FILE = 'src/include/duckdb_extension.h'
 # The header to be included by DuckDB Go extensions.
 DUCKDB_HEADER_GO_OUT_FILE = 'src/include/duckdb_go_extension.h'
 # An internal header for DuckDB C extensions.
 DUCKDB_HEADER_EXT_INTERNAL_OUT_FILE = 'src/include/duckdb/main/capi/extension_api.hpp'
```
