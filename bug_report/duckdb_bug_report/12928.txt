Title: Allow string stats larger than our default for parquet row group pruning
Description:
We only store up to 8 bytes of strings in our statistics, but Parquet stores more. If strings have common prefixes nothing can be pruned at all. I've modified Parquet's row group skipping to compare with larger strings.
