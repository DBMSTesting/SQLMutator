Title: Insert on conflict always returning nextval of primary key sequence
Description:
### What happens?

I created a table that uses a sequence for its primary key. When I insert a row with a conflict, the returned value is the next value of the sequence, not the primary key of the row.

### To Reproduce

To reproduce, just paste this into the CLI:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE test_id_sequence START 1;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test (
    id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('test_id_sequence'),
    value VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO test (value) values ('abc') RETURNING id;
INSERT INTO test (value) values ('abc') ON CONFLICT (value) DO NOTHING RETURNING id;
```

Actual output:
```
./duckdb test.db
v1.0.0 1f98600c2c
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
D CREATE SEQUENCE test_id_sequence START 1;
D 
D CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test (
      id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('test_id_sequence'),
      value VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE
  );
D 
D INSERT INTO test (value) values ('abc') RETURNING id;
┌───────┐
│  id   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     1 │
└───────┘
D 
D 
D INSERT INTO test (value) values ('abc') ON CONFLICT (value) DO NOTHING RETURNING id;
┌───────┐
│  id   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     2 │
└───────┘
D 
```

I expect that last `2` to be `1` as the row has not changed.

Testing with the latest nightly python module produces the same result.
