Title: Make CSV Parser strict_mode=True fail on a mix of new line delimiters.
Description:
With `strict_mode` set to True, the CSV parser will only accept files that consistently use either `\r\n`, `\r`, or `\n` as line endings. Any mixture of these line endings will result in a failure, accompanied by a suggestion to set `strict_mode=False`.
