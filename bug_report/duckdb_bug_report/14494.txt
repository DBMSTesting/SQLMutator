Title: Bug in percentage calculation in query_graph
Description:
The existing code to calculate the percentages shown in the html report `str(summarized_phase.percentage * 100)[:6]` will fail if the number is on the form of 8.09860748592347e-07 or similar. Changed to `round(summarized_phase.percentage,4)` to give a rounded number that is correct.


```python
summarized_phase.percentage = 8.09860748592347e-07
str(summarized_phase.percentage*100)[:6]
>'8.0986'
round(summarized_phase.percentage*100,4)
>0.0001
```
