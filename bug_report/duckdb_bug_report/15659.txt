Title: Regression in parameterized BETWEEN clause in 1.1
Description:
### What happens?

It appears that duckdb 1.1 requires explicitly casting parameters to a BETWEEN clause when it did not previously, and which it does not require if the parameters are specified (still as strings) withinin the query instead of as parameters. I could not find any mention of this change in the "Breaking SQL Changes" section of the [1.1 release post](https://duckdb.org/2024/09/09/announcing-duckdb-110.html#breaking-sql-changes) or elsewhere.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

with duckdb.connect() as conn:
    conn.execute("CALL dbgen(sf = 0.1);")
    print(
        conn.execute(
            """
            SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM ORDERS
            WHERE O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN ? AND ?
            """,
            ["1994-01-01", "1996-01-01"],
        ).fetchone()
    )
```

On duckdb 1.0 the query executes correctly, but on 1.1 it raises

```
BinderException: Binder Error: Cannot mix values of type DATE and VARCHAR in BETWEEN clause - an explicit cast is required
LINE 4:             WHERE O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN ? AND ?
```

And strangely the query works on 1.1 if you inline the parameters but still specify them as strings, i.e.

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM ORDERS
WHERE O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1994-01-01' AND '1996-01-01'
```
