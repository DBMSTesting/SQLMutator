Title: Not rounding
Description:
### What happens?

Not the desired output.



### To Reproduce


```sql
WITH total AS
  (SELECT round(amount, 4) AS amount_rounded
   FROM
     (SELECT 4.12313123 AS amount)
   UNION ALL
     (SELECT 4.33333333 AS amount))
SELECT *
FROM total;
```

Result:

4.66670000
4.33333333

Expected:

```
amount_rounded|
--------------+
        4.6667|
        4.3333|
```

This query works as expected:

```sql
with total as (
    select round(amount, 4) as amount_rounded
    from (
        select 4.66666666 as amount 
        union all 
        select 4.33333333 as amount
    )
)
select * from total;
```

This is relevant as the first query is generated by dbt and other tools.
