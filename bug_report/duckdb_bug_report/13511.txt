Title: DBeaver doesn't display system tables and views
Description:
> As shown in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-java/issues/74, DBeaver now displays DuckDB tables correctly.

Hello @szarnyasg 

The initial issue was about information_schema tables/views. Not about the custom tables.

![2024-02-28 14_17_55-DBeaver Ultimate 24 0 0 - _duck_010 db_ Script-178](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/assets/45152336/72904cf9-c1ef-44c7-8bf3-67186bf5f2a9)

The issue is still here, and I want to know how we can fix it.

Because I am one of these people :D

Please reopen this issue.
