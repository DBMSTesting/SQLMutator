Title: format issues with COPY FROM CSV
Description:
### What happens?

`COPY ... FROM ...` does not use the same auto-detection as `read_csv` (on column separators).

```sql
are@ryzen ~> duckdb
v1.1.1 af39bd0dcf
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D CREATE TABLE sales (
      salesid          INTEGER         NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
      , listid         INTEGER         NOT NULL
      , sellerid       INTEGER         NOT NULL
      , buyerid        INTEGER         NOT NULL
      , eventid        INTEGER         NOT NULL
      , dateid         SMALLINT        NOT NULL
      , qtysold        SMALLINT        NOT NULL
      , pricepaid      DECIMAL (8,2)
      , commission     DECIMAL (8,2)
      , saletime       TIMESTAMP
  )
  ;
D COPY sales FROM '~/tickitdb/sales_tab.txt' (FORMAT CSV, AUTO_DETECT true, timestampformat '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S', ignore_errors true);
Invalid Input Error: Mismatch between the number of columns (1) in the CSV file and what is expected in the scanner (10).
```

Instead, one must set `DELIMITER` explicitely:
```sql
COPY sales FROM '~/tickitdb/sales_tab.txt' (FORMAT CSV, AUTO_DETECT true, DELIMITER '\t', timestampformat '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S', ignore_errors true);
```

Interestingly, this is not the case for `csv_read` where the TAB delimiter would be detected correctly.
