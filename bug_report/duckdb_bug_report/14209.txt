Title: Add const char* versions of Prepare and Query
Description:
In pg_duckdb we work mostly with `char*` instead of `string` due to the Postgres being written in C instead of C++. So whenever we want to execute a query in DuckDB that query is not of the `string` type. This adds methods to `ClientContext` to allow executing such queries without first having to convert them to a `string`.
