Title: Reorder headers to fix MingW broken build
Description:
- The `DUCKDB_API` macro is defined in duckdb.h, so it should be
  included before any other C-API functions.

This patch moves the `capi_internal.hpp` header to the top, which
fixes #13911.  However I'm not sure if this is expected, or if
there is an underlying macro bug that is showing itself like this.
Any comments will be helpful.
  
- disable clang-format arround capi_internal.hpp to prevent automatic
  reordering

I also disabled automatic reordering by `clang-format` for _this_
header.  I hope this is acceptable.
