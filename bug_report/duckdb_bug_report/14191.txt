Title: `show all tables` sometimes gives incomplete results
Description:
### What happens?

When running `show all tables` with a newly attached catalog, the results sometimes seem incomplete. It often returns most of the tables, but on a second call, the full set of tables is shown.

Interestingly, if I use `select * from duckdb_tables()`, all tables are returned consistently as expected.

Could there be a potential race or locking issue with `show all tables` where not all schemas are fully loaded? It seems like `duckdb_tables()` is handling this correctly.

I'll be able to send a reproduction test case soon once an extension I'm working on is released.
