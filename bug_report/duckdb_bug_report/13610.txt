Title: Optimistic write to WAL: we cannot optimistically write block pointers if there are indexes
Description:
CC @taniabogatsch 

Follow-up fix from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13372, similar to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13577

We could make this work by inserting into the indexes in `WriteAheadLogDeserializer::ReplayRowGroupData` - but for now we just disable this if there are indexes in the table.
