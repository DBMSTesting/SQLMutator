Title: Add HTML and Graphviz support for explain analyze
Description:
HTML and Graphviz were only supported for explain output, not explain analyze. This PR adds support for explain analyze as well. In addition, the total query elapsed time is written into the root (Query) node so that it is available in the rendered html or graphviz output.
