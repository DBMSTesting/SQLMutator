Title: Cannot reference user defined type across schemas
Description:
### What happens?

When creating a type in a different schema, I cannot seem to reference it across schemas

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA s;
CREATE TYPE s.u AS STRUCT (a int, b int);
-- This works
CREATE TABLE s.t (
  u s.u
);

-- This doesn't work
CREATE TABLE main.t (
  u s.u
);
```

The error message is kind of ironic:

```
Catalog Error: Type with name u does not exist!
Did you mean "s.u"?
```
