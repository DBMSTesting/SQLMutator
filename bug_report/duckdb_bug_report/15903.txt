Title: [bug-fix] Avoid throwing in catch block for failed commits
Description:
I was performing some storage fault injection tests - where storage IO for one database repeatedly error.

I was running into a case - where I was injecting a failure on optimistic write fsync at https://github.com/motherduckdb/duckdb/blob/dad112b203212a590cb764695abf911e93d6ceee/src/transaction/duck_transaction.cpp#L207

The problem is if we see a storage error on WAL truncate at the following - the program will terminate due to throwing an exception in a try/catch.

I was curious on your thoughts on if the logic was refactored a bit to perform the rollback outside of the original try/catch. 

Some questions:
* Is it ok to propagate the first exception if rollback fails? 
* Will the db be invalidated if a RevertCommit fails?
