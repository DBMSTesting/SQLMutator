Title: For compressed deletes in the undo buffer - count the actual size that will be written to the WAL when determining the auto-checkpoint threshold
Description:
Follow-up fix from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11470

Fixes an issue where large bulk deletes were triggering large WAL writes because the system would incorrectly assume the WAL writes would be small
