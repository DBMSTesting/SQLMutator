Title: `ARRAY(SELECT x FROM (SELECT x FROM df order by rowid))` produces array that isn't ordered by `rowid`
Description:
### What happens?

I'm trying to get `ARRAY` to preserve order of a table (see #15011 and #15051) and the attempt

```sql
ARRAY(SELECT x FROM (SELECT x FROM df order by rowid))
```

is not giving the expected order, despite the seemingly equivalent (but more verbose and possibly more expensive)

```sql
SELECT ARRAY(SELECT x FROM (SELECT x FROM df ORDER BY row_number() OVER ()));
```

doing what I'd expect.


### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE df AS (
    FROM range(1_000_000) SELECT range AS x
);
```

Then

```sql
SELECT ARRAY(SELECT x FROM (SELECT x FROM df ORDER BY row_number() OVER ()));
```
produces the expected array `[0, 1, 2, ...]` but 

```sql
SELECT ARRAY(SELECT x FROM (SELECT x FROM df ORDER BY rowid));
```
produces, e.g., `[983040, 983041, 983042, 983043, 983044,...]`
