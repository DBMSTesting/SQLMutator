Title: Revert "CMake: Avoid dependency-inducing codegeneration of extension headers"
Description:
This reverts commit 1142f51b475f4ac2ef00fe615b23262cc043af13.

Some users bumped into problems like in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14722, I need to likely tweak the solution, but reverting is probably for the best.
