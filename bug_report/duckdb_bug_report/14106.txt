Title: read_json_auto parametric url from subquery
Description:
### What happens?

```sql

WITH matches AS (
    SELECT * FROM VALUES(
        (1),
        (2)
    ) t1(val)
)
SELECT * FROM matches m,
LATERAL (
    SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('https://httpbin.org/base64/' || m.val)
) url
```

I am trying to understand if DuckDB would support this use case, Where the url is not static but parametrized for each row. I believe that plays at odds with a few optimization DuckDB does, but if this case is not supported would love to know the precise rule for that!
