Title: read_csv returns Repeated Headers
Description:
### What happens?

The read_csv auto returns repeated headers when reading from multiple csv files

### To Reproduce

```
import duckdb
import os
duckdb_conn = duckdb.connect(
    database=":memory:",
    config={
        "memory_limit": "15GB",
        "worker_threads": 1,
        "preserve_insertion_order": True,
    },
)
file = ['test1.csv', 'test2.csv']
query = f"CREATE TABLE test AS SELECT * FROM read_csv({file}, header=True, ignore_errors=True, sample_size=10000, delim=',', parallel=False, all_varchar=True, union_by_name=True, filename=True) LIMIT 100"
duckdb_conn.execute(query)
duckdb_conn.sql("SELECT * FROM test")
```
Note that if I specify quote='"' argument inside read_csv, it would work without any issues.
