Title: Out of bound bins create weird bin label
Description:
### What happens?

Maybe this is the extra bin for everything beyond the last bin (something like infinity) but it's a bit surprising nonetheless. 

Maybe I am not reading the semantics correctly but I feel it could make sense to get n+1 bins for n thresholds where the first bin holds everything below the first threshold and the last holds everything above. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE obs(n BIGINT);
INSERT INTO obs VALUES (0), (5), (7), (12), (20), (23), (24), (25), (26), (28), (31), (34), (36), (41), (47);
SELECT histogram(n, [10, 20, 30, 40]) FROM obs;
```
```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  histogram(n, main.list_value(10, 20, 30, 40))  │
│              map(bigint, ubigint)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ {10=3, 20=2, 30=5, 40=3, 9223372036854775807=2} │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
