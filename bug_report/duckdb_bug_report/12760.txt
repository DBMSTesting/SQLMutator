Title: [Python] Fix extraction of days/seconds/microseconds from `timedelta` object
Description:
This PR fixes #12743

We ported a couple internal macros from the CPython codebase for easy access to the timedelta internals, and these have since been removed.

We now resort to using Python so the API is stable.
