Title: Fix get_current_time, today, current_date backwards compatibility
Description:
This PR is a followup of #15125 which changed a couple of datetime functions from scalar functions to macros.
This broke de/serialization compatibility of query plans between versions as the functions could no longer be found in the scalar function catalog set.

With this PR these functions are changed back to be scalar functions, but uses the `bind_expression` hook to produce the same cast expression as the new macro implementations do.
