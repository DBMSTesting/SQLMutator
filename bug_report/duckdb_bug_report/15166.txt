Title: Functions can throw errors
Description:
Basically the title. Functions now have an attribute `errors` which can be set to `CAN_THROW_ERROR` or `CANNOT_ERROR`. This PR is the first of many to properly set this attribute for all functions within the DuckDB catalog. Setting this attribute can help mitigate scenarios where an optimization applies filter2 before filter1 even though the user provided order was correct due to filter1 filtering out values that cause filter2 to throw.

Currently not all functions correctly initialize errors, but this touches about half of them
