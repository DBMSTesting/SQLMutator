Title: Appender C API does not support generated columns
Description:
### What happens?

Inserting using the appender C API does not work:

* Inserting a NULL or default value does not work, raises errors
* Not inserting anything does not work either - errors with number of column mismatch 

### To Reproduce

```cpp
#include "duckdb.h"

int main() {
  duckdb_database db;
  duckdb_connection con;

  if (duckdb_open("db", &db) == DuckDBError)
    throw;
  if (duckdb_connect(db, &con) == DuckDBError)
    throw;

  // works
  // if (duckdb_query(con, "create or replace table tbl (a varchar)", NULL) == DuckDBError)
  // does not work
  if (duckdb_query(con, "create or replace table tbl (a varchar, b varchar generated always as (a))", NULL) == DuckDBError)
    throw;

  duckdb_appender appender;
  if (duckdb_appender_create(con, NULL, "tbl", &appender) == DuckDBError)
    throw;

  // append row
  duckdb_append_varchar(appender, "a");
  // not appending anything at column b does not work
  // duckdb_append_default(appender); // does not work either
  // duckdb_append_varchar(appender, "b"); // does not work either
  if (duckdb_appender_end_row(appender) == DuckDBError)
    throw;

  duckdb_appender_destroy(&appender);
  duckdb_disconnect(&con);
  duckdb_close(&db);

  return 0;
}
```
