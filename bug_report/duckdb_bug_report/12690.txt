Title: Rework arena allocator allocation policy - and increase pivot threshold
Description:
This PR reworks the arena allocator allocation policy. Previously we would always double the previous allocation size. While this makes sense initially (when doubling from e.g. 4KB -> 8KB, etc), always doubling the capacity means we can end up doing very large allocations, which can then (unnecessarily) fail. This PR caps the natural doubling that occurs at 16MB instead - after which we keep on allocating 16MB chunks. 

This also fixes an issue where `current_capacity` had to be reset but was not reset in all situations (in particular in `ArenaAllocator::Reset`). This could lead to the allocation threshold getting very large if arena allocators were reset and re-used repeatedly in certain scenarios which could lead to unnecessary OOM errors.

Unrelated - this PR also increases the `pivot_threshold` from 10 to 20, which was found to be a better switch-over point.
