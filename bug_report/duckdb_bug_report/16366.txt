Title: MAIN_BRANCH_VERSIONING: main branch to get descriptors like v1.3.0-dev1234 instead of v1.2.1-dev1234
Description:
Originally pointed out by @Mytherin.

Implementation is more or less straightforward, where toggling MAIN_BRANCH_VERSIONING at Makefile or CMake level will toggle between the two versioning schemes.

Only not trivial bit is what should happen AFTER a minor release (say 1.3.0):
* branch v1.3-xyz should have a commit turning the default to FALSE (so that subsequent builds on that branch will be named v1.3.1-xyz instead of v1.4.0-xyz)
* branch v1.3-xyz with that commit should be merged into `main`
* `main` should revert the commit turning to FALSE, so that `main` branch (and branches forked from there) will keep the v1.4.0-xyz versioning scheme.

This dance needs to happen after any minor release, I could not think of a more lightweight solution.

This in any case should influence only NOT tagged versions.
