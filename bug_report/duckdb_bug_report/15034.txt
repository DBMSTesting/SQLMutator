### What happens?

I created the amalgamation files of DUCKDB.

But it cannot be compiled with QT and MingW.

The compiler gives the following errors

error: 'UnicodeType' does not name a type; did you mean 'DOMNodeType'?
error: 'GraphemeIterator' does not name a type
error: expected declaration before '}' token ---> namespace end
