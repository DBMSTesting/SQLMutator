Title: remove conditional around fsync in single_file_block_manager
Description:
This calls fsync() unconditionally, whether DIRECT_IO is enabled or not, on the DB file. DIRECT_IO doesn't guarantee durability of individual writes, so this is still necessary. If the file is already durable, this will be a NOP, so the conditional adds no value.
