Title: Aggregate function quantile_cont(x, pos) does not support "reusable column alias"
Description:
### What happens?

When passing an alias from a prior expression in the SELECT-clause as 2nd argument ("pos") to [quantile_pos(x, pos)](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/aggregates#quantile_contx-pos), we get an error indicating that column "pos" does not exist. The value of the expression indicated by the alias is an otherwise valid argument value for this function. 

### To Reproduce

```
select .5 as "pos"
,      quantile_cont(x, "pos")
from   range(0,100) as T(x)
```
output:
```
Binder Error: Referenced column "pos" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "T.x"
LINE 2: ,      quantile_cont(x, "pos")
```
