Title: ProgressBarDisplay: Pass down 'query' and 'total_time'
Description:
Marginal, idea here is that allowing ProgressBarDisplay to override those methods allows passing down of some more relevant informations / customize progress bars a bit more with information that is already available.

Then ProgressBarDisplay could show the total time consumed by the query, potentially even in a remote situation (where recomputing the time again is not really feasible. 

Bumped against this in the context of duckdb-wasm, where worker(s) send pass those messages but can't really reimplement timing or so.

As a whole it's marginal so also to be reviewed later. I might want to consider include this on the DuckDB-Wasm side, but should have no real effects.
