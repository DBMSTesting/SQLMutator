Title: Documentation for read_csv function claims header is false by default, but isn't
Description:
### What happens?

The [documentation for the read_csv function](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/csv/overview#csv-loading) claims the default for the header parameter is FALSE, but it actually isn't **EDIT: when the file contains all VARCHAR columns**

### To Reproduce

With any valid CSV file with no header (I tried with a single column and three **EDIT: all VARCHAR type**):

`SELECT count(*) FROM read_csv('path_to.csv')` is one less than `SELECT count(*) FROM read_csv('path_to.csv', header = false)`, which according to the documentation shouldn't be the case.
