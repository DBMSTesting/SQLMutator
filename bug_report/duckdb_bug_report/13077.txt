Title: Avoid inconsistent state when writing same persistent from multiple threads
Description:
### What happens?

creating persistent secrets using `LocalFileSecretStorage::WriteSecret` can result in secrets ending up in an inconsistent state. 

The solution is to do a write to tmp file, then move the tmp file to the actual file once written, similar to what we do in `ExtensionHelper::InstallExtensionInternal`
