Title: Parquet reader with nullable datetime and millisecond precision fails
Description:
### What happens?

Reading a parquet file with a Timestamp column using milliseconds precision fails when the column value is NULL.
It is trying to convert the value from MS precision to US precision and fails.



### To Reproduce

Download the attached file and unzip (`out_1.parquet` has a NULL value, `out_2.parquet` has a non-NULL value)

Run:

```
$ duckdb -c "select * from 'out_1.parquet'"
Conversion Error:
Could not convert Timestamp(MS) to Timestamp(US)
```

```
$ duckdb -c "select * from 'out_2.parquet'"
┌────────────────────────────┐

│  timestamp with time zone  │
├────────────────────────────┤

└────────────────────────────┘
```
