Title: [Dev] Update vendored ZSTD to v1.5.6
Description:
This PR was sparked by work on new compression related functionality, which made me notice that `ZDICT_trainFromBuffer_fastCover` was missing.

In an attempt to add the definition for that function, I was already bringing in 6+ new files, so I figured I would spin it off in a new PR that updates the entire ZSTD library we vendor to 1.5.6 (and adds the missing function definitions + files)
