Title: Disallow attaching non-DuckDB databases if `enable_external_access` is disabled
Description:
This partially reverts the changes made in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14568

We used to fully disallow `ATTACH` when this setting was disabled. We now allow attaching, and fail later based on the `allowed_directories`/`allowed_paths `. This allows us to still attach files if they are within the allowed set of paths. 

Storage extensions do not necessarily abide by these rules, however. For now we just move back to disallowing `ATTACH` of non-DuckDB files entirely if the setting is set to false.
