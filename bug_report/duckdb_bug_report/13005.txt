Title: [Spark API] Fix group by compatibility issues
Description:
This PR fixes #12986

1. `avg` without expressions selects all columns of the relation that inherit from NumericType
2. Column produced from `count` is renamed from `count_star()` to `count`
3. `groupBy` now accepts a `list` of columns as argument to the constructor.
