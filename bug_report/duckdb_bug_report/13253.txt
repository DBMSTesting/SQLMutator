Title: (Nightly Build) Fuzzer: DuckDB Internal Error with the LEAST function
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB with the nightly build throws an internal error with the LEAST function.

### To Reproduce

PoC (Any of the following can trigger this internal error):
```sql
SELECT LEAST('');
SELECT GREATEST('');
SELECT LEAST('abc');
```

Output:
```
INTERNAL Error: Function greatest returned a STRING_LITERAL or INTEGER_LITERAL type - return an explicit type instead
```

The internal error seems to occur when there is only one string argument with the LEAST/GREATEST function.
