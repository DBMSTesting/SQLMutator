Title: INSERT OR IGNORE with Autoincrement primary key / sequence RETURNING wrong id;
Description:
### What happens?

Given a table with a unique constraint index, and an autoincrement primary key based on a sequence :

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE seq START 1;
CREATE TABLE bug (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT NEXTVAL(seq), name VARCHAR);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx ON bug (name);

INSERT OR IGNORE INTO bug VALUES (DEFAULT, 'toto') RETURNING(id);  # 1st try ok on empty table
```

```
┌───────┐
│  id   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     1 │
└───────┘
```
OK

```sql
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO bug VALUES (DEFAULT, 'toto') RETURNING(id); # 2nd try insertion is ignored, but returning id has a bad value;
```

```
┌───────┐
│  id   │
│ int32 │
├───────┤
│     2 │
└───────┘
```

KO, should be id=1 because entry already exists in the table.
