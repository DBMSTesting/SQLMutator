Title: A confusion about Top-N operator
Description:
### What happens?

In `TopNHeap::Reduce`, the reduce threshold is determined by `payload_chunk.size()`. However, the `payload_chunk` is only used as a temporary data holder in `TopNHeap::Combine`. It's `heap_data` right?

### To Reproduce

```cpp
void TopNHeap::Combine(TopNHeap &other) {
	other.Finalize();

	// FIXME: heaps can be merged directly instead of doing it like this
	// that only really speeds things up if heaps are very large, however
	TopNScanState state;
	other.InitializeScan(state, false);
	while (true) {
		payload_chunk.Reset();
		other.Scan(state, payload_chunk);
		if (payload_chunk.size() == 0) {
			break;
		}
		Sink(payload_chunk);
	}
	Reduce();
}

void TopNHeap::Reduce() {
	if (payload_chunk.size() < ReduceThreshold()) {
		// only reduce when we pass the reduce threshold
		return;
	}
	...
}
```
