Title: Modify create_art_varchar.benchmark so it passes weekly regressions
Description:
Currently the benchmark causes the weekly regressions to fail due to a timeout. 

With these changes the benchmark passes.

(This issue)[https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2855] explains that the benchmark now takes ~2x as long, so I changed range(7200000) to range(3600000)
