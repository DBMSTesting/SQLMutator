Title: Discrepancy Between Count and Sum Queries in SQL
Description:
### What happens?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM v0 
WHERE (CURRENT_DATE, c0) != (CAST(NULL AS TEXT), '0');


SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN (CURRENT_DATE, c0) != (CAST(NULL AS TEXT), '0') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
FROM v0;
```
The two SQL queries have a common sub-clause: (CURRENT_DATE, c0) != (CAST(NULL AS TEXT), '0').

The first query counts all the rows for which this condition is TRUE. The second query calculates the total sum, where the CASE WHEN clause takes the value 1 when this condition is TRUE, thus increasing the sum by 1.

It seems that both queries should return the same result, but they return 0 and 1, respectively.

### To Reproduce

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0; 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;  
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v0;  
CREATE TABLE t0 (c0 TEXT);  
CREATE TABLE t1 (c0 TEXT);  

CREATE VIEW v0 AS 
SELECT t0.c0 
FROM t1 
LEFT JOIN t0 ON t1.c0 = t0.c0;
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('example_value');

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM v0 
WHERE (CURRENT_DATE, c0) != (CAST(NULL AS TEXT), '0');


SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN (CURRENT_DATE, c0) != (CAST(NULL AS TEXT), '0') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
FROM v0;
```
