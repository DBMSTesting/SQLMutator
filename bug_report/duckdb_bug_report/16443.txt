Title: Filter Combiner Clean-up: move filter pushdown to separate functions, remove old commented out code
Description:
This PR cleans up the FilterCombiner:

* The `GenerateTableScanFilters` had been growing, this PR splits the various pieces into separate functions which makes the function much more readable
* At some point (years ago) we commented out a bunch of code here - that is unlikely to ever come back, so just remove it

This shouldn't change functionality with one minor exception: when pushing down a `prefix(col, 'literal')` filter, we now remove the original `prefix` filter (since the filter we are pushing down exactly computes the prefix).
