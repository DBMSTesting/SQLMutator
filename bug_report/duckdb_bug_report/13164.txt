Title: SSLConnection Error Connecting To Minio Over LAN
Description:
### What happens?

Trying to establish a connection between duckdb and a Minio instance over the local network, however I receive this error:
`IO Error: SSLConnection error for HTTP HEAD to 'https://IP:port/bucket/parquet'`

### To Reproduce



```
#  Make sure to have a Minio instance available on the local network.

import duckdb
try:
    connection = duckdb.connect()
    duckdb_py_connection = connection.execute(f"""
                            INSTALL httpfs;
                            LOAD httpfs;
                            SET s3_endpoint='IP:port';
                            SET s3_region='region';
                            SET s3_access_key_id='key_id';
                            SET s3_secret_access_key='access_key';
                            SET s3_use_ssl = true;
                            SET s3_url_style = path;""")
   
    duckdb_py_connection = connection.execute(f"SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3a://bucket/parquet') LIMIT 100")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error querying minio: {e}")
