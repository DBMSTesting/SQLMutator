Title: Rework `union_by_name` so that files are no longer kept open
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11334

When running `read_csv` or `read_parquet` with `union_by_name=true`, we need to open all files that are part of the query during bind time in order to determine the result schema, as any file that is part of the file list can modify the schema (by adding columns or changing types of existing columns). Previously we would cache all of these file handles in order to speed up subsequent reads. However, when running `union_by_name` over many files, these cached file handles could lead to issues:

* Too many open file handles as operating system limits are exceeded
* Out-of-memory errors as each of the open file handles also kept the first few megabytes of the file cached (in case of the CSV reader)

This PR reworks the `union_by_name` flag so that it opens the files, and then closes them again. Only the first file handle is kept cached. Subsequent files are re-opened and re-read during the actual scan. Instead we only cache a subset of the information for each file (e.g. the CSV reader options, types and names for the file).
