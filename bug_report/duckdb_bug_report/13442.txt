Title: [Python] Add `set_default_connection` to the `duckdb` module
Description:
This method allows the user to change the connection that's used by the module internally when invoking DuckDBPyConnection methods (such as `.sql`, `.table` etc..) directly on the `duckdb` module.

I also considered adding a context manager for this, to basically create a scope where the default_connection is overridden and reset back after the scope ends, that might be a future PR.

### Incompatible change:
Hopefully nobody cares but I figured I'd mention it regardless, `default_connection` is no longer an `attribute` on the module, instead it's now a method.
It doesn't seem to be possible to create a property that can have getters and setters on the module so turning it into `default_connection()` and `set_default_connection(connection: DuckDBPyConnection)` was the next best thing
