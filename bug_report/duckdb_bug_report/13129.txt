Title: Keep track of user-provided configuration options, and compare them as well for database instance caching purposes
Description:
When opening a new connection to an existing database we need the configuration to match, otherwise the configuration settings are silently discarded which can lead to odd behavior. Previously we would only compare `access_mode`. However, we would prefer to compare all user-provided configuration settings. 

This PR enables this behavior by keeping all user-provided settings in a new dictionary - `user_options`. When `SetOptionByName` is called for a `DBConfig` that does not belong to a database directly, options are only added to the `user_options` instead of being directly processed. When a database is initialized, we store the `user_options`. If the `user_options` provided in a following connection differ, the connection is refused.
