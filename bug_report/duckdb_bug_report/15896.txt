Title: Rename RFC_4180 to STRICT_MODE. Change default to true. Use the same option in the sniffer as the parser.
Description:
It would likely confuse users to interact with the `rfc_4180` option, especially since most people encountering a broken CSV file are unfamiliar with the standard in the first place.

Hence, this PR renames the `rfc_4180` option to `strict_mode`.

Additionally, we have decided to change the default value of this option to true. As a result, any CSV file with structural or schema errors will, by default, throw an error.

To assist users who may need to configure this new, DuckDB-specific option, I moved the possible fix message—`* Disable the parser's strict mode (strict_mode=false) to allow reading rows that do not comply with the CSV standard.`—to the top of the errors it could be relevant to.

Finally, the sniffer/parser will behave consistently with the option's setting, whether it was explicitly configured by the user or left as the default.
