Title: Unexpected result when using `IN` with `DATE` values
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test cases. The first query should return `true` since the timestamp after casting is `2024-08-09` and the `IN` expression should be evaluated to `true`. Besides, if the `false` is expected, its negation query should not be evaluated as `false`.

It could be reproduced on both the newest source version and the nightly build.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 TIMESTAMP) ;
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('2024-08-09 14:48:00');

SELECT * FROM t1; -- 2024-08-09 14:48:00
SELECT (CAST(t1.c0 AS DATE) IN ('2024-08-09')) FROM t1; -- false (unexpected)
SELECT NOT (CAST(t1.c0 AS DATE) IN ('2024-08-09')) FROM t1; -- false
```
