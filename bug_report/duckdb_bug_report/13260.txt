Title: Correctly add profiling information from finalize events to operator timings in EXPLAIN ANALYZE
Description:
Previously timings of finalize tasks (such as finalizing hash tables, merge rounds in order by, etc) were not included in the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. These tasks can take a considerable amount of time depending on the workload. This PR extends the `ExecutorTask` so it correctly measures the timing and adds it to the corresponding operator.
