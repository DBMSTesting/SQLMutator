Title: [Python SQLLogic Test Runner] Implement support for the `unzip` statement
Description:
This PR fixes <https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3994>

`unzip` was added a while back, but support for it was never added to the python sqllogic tester implementation.
Resulting in a parser error for tests that used this new statement type.
