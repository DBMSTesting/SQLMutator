Title: [Arrow] Support consuming an "arrow_array_stream" PyCapsule
Description:
This PR implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/10716

This allows consuming arrow array streams from PyCapsules, which do not necessarily have to be created by `pyarrow`.

For regular arrow scans we use `pyarrow` to perform filter pushdown on the stream, constructing a scanner to do so.
When scanning from a PyCapsule we disable this so no interaction with `pyarrow` is required.
