Title: Rework table bindings to be components (`catalog`, `schema`, `table`) instead of flat strings

This PR reworks table bindings so that they can have multiple components (`catalog, schema, table`) instead of being a flat string. This is accomplished through the `BindingAlias` class. This aligns the way that bindings work with what Postgres does as well, and enables queries like the following to run correctly:

```sql
create schema s1;
create schema s2;
create table s1.tbl(i int);
create table s2.tbl(i int);
select * from s1.tbl, s2.tbl;
```

In addition, we now fully qualify table names, allowing us to mix and match references to the tables including schemas/catalogs. This fixes queries like the following, which previously failed because `i` would not be considered as equivalent to `s1.tbl.i`.

```sql
create schema s1;
create table s1.tbl(i int);
select s1.tbl.i from s1.tbl group by i;
```
