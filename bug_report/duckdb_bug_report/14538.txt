Title: [Arrow] Fix issue where uninitialized memory was being read when scanning empty lists
Description:
This PR fixes #14497

I can't produce a test for this other than the reproduction from the issue, which uses pyiceberg.
The problem was obvious though, there are no offsets when the list is empty, so `offsets[0]` accesses uninitialized memory, it no longer does that.
