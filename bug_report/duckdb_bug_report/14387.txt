Title: Decimal to double conversion results in slightly incorrect values
Description:
### What happens?

Casting a decimal column from a parquet dataset to double results in slightly incorrect values

### To Reproduce

```
 import pandas as pd
import duckdb
import pyarrow as pa
import os
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

getcontext().prec = 20

PARQUET_FOLDER_PATH = '<put file path here>'
column = [Decimal(x) / Decimal(1.0) for x in range(2806)]
df = pd.DataFrame({
  'decimal_column': column
})
schema = pa.schema([('decimal_column', pa.decimal128(38, 18))])
parquet_file_path = os.path.join(PARQUET_FOLDER_PATH, 'test.parquet')
df.to_parquet(parquet_file_path, schema=schema)
duckdb_connection = duckdb.connect()
output = duckdb_connection.sql('SELECT CAST("decimal_column" as double) as casted_column from read_parquet("{}")'.format(parquet_file_path))
duckdb_connection.close()
```
If you print `output`, you can see that 2805.0 in being displayed as 2804.9999999999995, 2803 as 2803.0000000000005 and so on.
