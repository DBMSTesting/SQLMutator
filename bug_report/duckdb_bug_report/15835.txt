Title: No support for that ALTER TABLE option yet
Description:
### What happens?

The previous issue I reported was closed: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15821
I followed the suggestion to downgrade to version 1.1.2 and executed the commands according to the official documentation:
https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/alter_table.html
However, I am still encountering the same error. Could you please let me know if there are any other areas where I might have gone wrong?

### To Reproduce

```
import duckdb

db_path = "test.duckdb"
conn = duckdb.connect(db_path)

print(duckdb.__version__)
sql = """
    CREATE TABLE integers (i INTEGER, j INTEGER);
"""
conn.execute(sql)
print(conn.fetchall())

sql = """
   ALTER TABLE integers ADD PRIMARY KEY (i);
"""
conn.execute(sql)
print(conn.fetchall())
```

output
```
1.1.2
[]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".\utils\database\test.py", line 17, in <module>
    conn.execute(sql)
duckdb.duckdb.NotImplementedException: Not implemented Error: No support for that ALTER TABLE option yet!
