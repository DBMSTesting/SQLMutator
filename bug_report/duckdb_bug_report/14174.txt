Title: [Adaptive Sniffer] In case files have only one row, be more permissive to detect headers and types.
Description:
When globbing multiple CSV files, if a file that would be ran with the adaptive sniffer only has one row,  the adaptive sniffer could misidentify if the one row would be a header or a data row. 

This PR extends the checks to identify this case, and adds tests for it.

Fix: #14166
