Title: Avoid fast fail: change defaults to run all tests in more cases
Description:
scripts/run_tests_one_by_one.py and SQLLogic's tests Python wrapper currently exit on first failure.

I think it carries more information, given multiple failures might be easier to debug, for limited cost, given default should be still all passing so all executed.

Also fix some nonsense in scripts/sqllogictest/result.py, unsure when it has become outdated.
