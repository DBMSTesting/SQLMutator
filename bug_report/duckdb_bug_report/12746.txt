Title: read_csv cannot skip lines on the basis of comment characters
Description:
### What happens?

Many csv files include headers or comments, typically denoted by a comment symbol or pattern (commonly `#`).  Almost all mainstream csv parsers (R, read.table(), read_csv() etc, python pandas, excel, etc) support user-configured argument to skip lines that begin with a specified comment pattern, but I was surprised to see this option missing from read_csv().  


### To Reproduce

Consider parsing this classic CO2 dataset 

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv("https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt")
```

(Obviously we can often work around this using the `skip` parameter, though that is less convenient and does not support edge cases where commented lines may appear in the middle or at the end of data).
