Title: [CSV Sniffer] Date Adjustment
Description:
This PR makes sniffing slightly more restrictive.
The separator must be either :
* `.`
* `-`
* `/`
* ` `

The year must have at least two digits.

In addition, we also enforce that date/timestamp formats set by the user are tested even if the underlying data is not a numeric value.
