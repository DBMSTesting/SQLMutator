Title: fix: improve C scalar functions API
Description:
Address two problems with the scalar function C API:

1. Scalar functions didn't have a way to report errors and raise exceptions.

2. Scalar functions were passed the extra_info pointer if it set as the first argument to the function, which differed from table functions.

Change the C api for scalar functions such that the function is invoked with a pointer to the CScalarFunctionInfo rather than just a pointer to the extra_info that the user may have set.

Add `duckdb_scalar_function_get_extra_info()` to retrieve the extra_info pointer.

Add `duckdb_scalar_function_set_error()` to allow a scalar function to indicate an error has occurred and an exception should be thrown.

Rather than passing the extra_info directly to the the function
