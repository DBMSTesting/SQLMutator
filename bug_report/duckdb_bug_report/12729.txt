Title: INTERNAL Error caused by INNER JOIN
Description:
### What happens?

When I try to perform an inner join on two tables using DuckDB, I encounter an INTERNAL Error.

### To Reproduce

``` sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INT4, c1 VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE t2(c0 TINYINT, PRIMARY KEY(c0));
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (14161972);
INSERT INTO t1(c0, c1) VALUES (-1.438515327E9, 4.43806148E8); 
SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c0 = t2.c0;
```
```
INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast: value -255 outside of target range [0, -1]
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
