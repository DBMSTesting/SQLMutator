Title: Disable `JEMALLOC_HAVE_MADVISE_HUGE` in jemalloc
Description:
This led to accessing uninitialized memory on systems that did not have it, and I don't think it's an important setting anyway.

Found by this run: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/10587966052/job/29339688673

I've also changed the initialization of a buffer I set in #13564 to match the default on Linux.
