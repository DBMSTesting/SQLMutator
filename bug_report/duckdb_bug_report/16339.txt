Title: Python API: .to_df() segfaults when NumPy is installed but Pandas is missing
Description:
### What happens?

Calling `.to_df()` in the Python API causes a segmentation fault if NumPy is installed but Pandas is not. Ideally, the function should raise a clear error indicating that Pandas is required.

### To Reproduce

```

Creating virtual environment at: venv
Activate with: source venv/bin/activate
