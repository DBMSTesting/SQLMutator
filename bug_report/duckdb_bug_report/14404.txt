Title: `on conflict ... do update set`  fails with `current_timestamp`
Description:
### What happens?

A seemingly correct query using `on conflict ... do update` fails with 

> Binder Error: Table "xxx" does not have a column named "current_timestamp"

while `current_timestamp` is not used as a column name.

### To Reproduce

Can be reproduced with:

```
CREATE TABLE map_ts (
      key VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
      ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
      int INTEGER
      ,map MAP(INTEGER, TIMESTAMPTZ)
);

// This is OK
insert into map_ts (key, int) values ('someKey1', 1)  on conflict (key) do update set int = 2;

// This is OK
// insert into map_ts (key, ts)  values ('someKey2', current_timestamp);

// This is KO
insert into map_ts (key, ts)  values ('someKey3', current_timestamp)  on conflict (key) do update set ts = current_timestamp;
```
