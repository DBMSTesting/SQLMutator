Title: Execution time increasing when running a query multiple times on Windows
Description:
### What happens?

Within one of our specific use case we noticed that when running a query in a loop the execution time increase at every iteration.

### To Reproduce

[The parquet file to reproduce the behavior](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xxsogd2cmkhmdqa7esoef/IncreasingTime.parquet?rlkey=ru12s3v4u1gv5cel50n5sn29f&st=yftod4pl&dl=0)

[The query to reproduce the behavior](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lmbvyfbqxtjoz5shf1qkv/IncreasingTimeQuery.sql?rlkey=8eq73a5day3xh9n8hkdzwk8gb&st=rznnnoyj&dl=0) (it read from the parquet)

Using a connection with ```datasource = :memory:``` in order to execute the specified query we duplicate this connection for every iteration.
The behavior is reproducible even without duplicating the connection.

Our implementation is based on Giorgi's C# DuckDB wrapper, but we have reproduced the issue also on Python and the CLI (by manually executing the query multiple time in sequence).
