Title: Parquet reader: Avoid applying bloom filters if we are casting columns
Description:
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16161 added the ability for stats to be cast from `CastColumnReaders`. While this works, we cannot do bloom filter look-ups through these casts (at least not without additional code to deal with the cast at this layer).

Fixes the issue uncovered at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16191
