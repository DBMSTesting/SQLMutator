Title: Fix data race when writing GeoParquet
Description:
When writing GeoParquet, we stored the column-level auxiliary geoparquet statistics/metadata directly in the `GeometryColumnWriter`, which is not thread safe, causing issues when multiple row-groups are written concurrently. 

This PR moves the column-level geoparquet metadata from the `ColumnWriter` into the associated `ColumnWriterState`, and also introduces a write-lock on the file-level geoparquet metadata struct so that the threads don't race each other when flushing the stats after finishing a row group.

Additionally I've changed the `GeometryColumnWriter` into a `WKBColumnWriter` that directly subclasses the `StringColumnWriter` instead of trying to template the base class as that is significantly messier to do when we also need to wrap the associated state.  This makes the code a bit cleaner, and makes sense given that the WKB geometry encoding is the only one we support right now anyway. I've also realized that the implementation for the other encodings is going to end up different enough that there is probably no point in trying to generalize all the geoparquet specific encoding logic into a common base class anyway.
