Title: Keyboard interrupt (ctrl-c) immediately kills DuckDB on Windows (PowerShell).
Description:
### What happens?

When I press ctrl-c, DuckDB immediately exits. However, I would prefer it to _never_ exit when I press ctrl-c. In other shells and REPLs, I use ctrl-c to clear the current line, etc. For example, bash, zsh, python, ipython. I've noticed that in Linux (WSL), pressing ctrl-c _twice_ causes DuckDB to exit. This is preferable, but still not ideal. (Normally one would use ctrl-d to exit a shell or REPL.)

### To Reproduce

Run `duckdb`, then press `ctrl-c` in Windows PowerShell.

### OS:

Windows 11

### DuckDB Version:

v1.1.3 19864453f7

### DuckDB Client:

CLI
