Title: Realnest HEP benchmarks
Description:
There is a repo with the HEP (High-Energy Physics) Data [benchmarks](https://github.com/iris-hep/adl-benchmarks-index/?tab=readme-ov-file) containing eight queries to one of the datasets we use in the the `RealNest` benchmarks (`run2012B_singleMu`).

The queries from the [Amazon Athena](https://github.com/RumbleDB/iris-hep-benchmark-athena/tree/master/queries) implementation of that benchmark are usable in `Duckdb` almost as they are.

This PR adds those queries to the realness benchmarks set.
