Title: Add missing global options to Python's `write_parquet`
Description:
This PR adds more options to DuckDB's Python Relational API for `write_parquet`, matching the `COPY TO` options, addressing #8896:
- `partition_by`
- `write_partition_columns`
- `overwrite`
- `per_thread_output`
- `use_tmp_file`
- `append`

I would also like to note that the `overwrite` option that was added in the `to_csv` function (#10382) technically passes `overwrite_or_ignore` to the underlying engine:
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/fd5de0607d7ab5bdddad62cc1a0225be72dff967/tools/pythonpkg/src/pyrelation.cpp#L1291-L1296
In order to match this behavior, I've also implemented it the same way. 
Changing it to pass `overwrite` and introducing `overwrite_or_ignore` as an option would be a [breaking change](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/copy.html#copy--to-options), thus I've avoided doing it.

I've also improved the `test_to_parquet` tests by introducing new tests for the above mentioned flags, as well as parameterizing the Pandas engine (similar to the `test_to_csv` tests â€“ using both `NumpyPandas` and `ArrowPandas`).

This PR also makes the Python stubs for `{to,write}_{csv,parquet}` both match, as they are technically aliases.
