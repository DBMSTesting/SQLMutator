Title: After successfully loading large text CSV file, SUMMARIZE fails with OOM at exactly 80% of physical memory
Description:
### What happens?

after loading a large text table (see https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13177 to load the data), `SUMMARIZE` fails with OOM at exactly 80% of the physical memory footprint (2 different machines: 12.8/16gb and 51.2/64gb).

I would have thought that the execution plan would perform the operation out-of-core, instead of exhausting memory

### To Reproduce

load data as per: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13177

```
SUMMARIZE opinions;
```

MacOS 12.7.5 (21H1222)  (fails on other machines too)
