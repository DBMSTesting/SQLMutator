Title: csv_read() creates table with only VARCHARs when all headers and values are surrounded by quotes
Description:
### What happens?

This is probably not a bug but I cannot find anyway around this problem (have scoured the duckdb documentation and posts but cannot seem to find a solution).  I have CSV files which have quotes around all the headers and values but I cannot find the magic combo to effectively have the CSV reader ignore those quotes and infer the correct types.  As such, it treats everything as `VARCHAR.`

### To Reproduce

example csv file would be:

```
"DATE", "ID", "NAME", "AGE"
"2024/08/05","ID1","DAVE",47
"2024/08/05","ID2","ANNA",32
"2024/08/05","ID3","BILL",49
```

creates table with all columns as `VARCHAR`
