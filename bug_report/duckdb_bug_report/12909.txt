Title: [CHORE]: Fix minor SQL test case
Description:
closes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2482

In the linked PR, the test was moved to the bottom of the `statistics_between.test` test file. However, it seems like the regex was incorrectly copied. This PR should fix that. [Original PR that moved the test](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/10553)
