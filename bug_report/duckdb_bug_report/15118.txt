Title: Added support for OSS authentication and oss:// protocol with s3fs method
Description:
This change would enable users to authenticate to Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS). OSS is [fully compatible with S3 SDK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/mount-oss-buckets-to-local-file-systems-by-using-amazon-s3-protocols) as long as the endpoint is correctly routed with virtual hosted style.

This change was made because:
- Even when users are able to use S3 authentication and protocol to directly connect to OSS, some DuckDB functions like `iceberg_scan` would still fail to fetch the data due to the `oss://` protocol written in the metadata.
- No one is maintaining `ossfs` anymore, which begets some unknown error when user tried to authenticate with `fsspec`.
