Title: More nightly test fixes
Description:
* Explicitly define padding in 12-byte structs to align them to 16-bytes consistently, also on 32-bit platforms
* In extension update test, install inet again but do it from a remote source
* Use `optional_idx`  for `Allocator::DecayDelay`, and correctly handle the scenario where it is not set (due to jemalloc not being available)
* Simplify test to avoid `table not missing` failure when using alternative verify
