Title: Remove most BUILD_ options for extensions, using CORE_EXTENSIONS
Description:
Only exception is `BUILD_JEMALLOC`, given jemalloc is special in many regards.

Plan is to do first a round on this, then adding a warning to use those in Makefile, then moving the warning to error.

This might need a couple of iterations, to clean up on ancillary repos (like the docs) but getting there.

Proper heavy lifting is done by CORE_EXTENSIONS option, introduced in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13116.

Once this is in, moving extensions out of tree should become simpler and one more difference removed between in and out of tree.
