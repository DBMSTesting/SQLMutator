Title: Unify task (un)blocking in physical operators
Description:
... and add functionality to _prevent_ tasks from being blocked, e.g., when we have a streaming `LIMIT` on top of a blocking source operator. This has caused us some deadlock issues in the past, which this PR fixes, and hopefully prevents from happening in the future.
