Title: Create a dedicated `RegisteredStateManager` that manages client context states in a thread-safe manner
Description:
The registered states are now being used in different extensions for a wider variety of purposes than initially designed for - it's important the registered states can be accessed in a thread-safe manner as these are also accessed during query execution (although some of these use cases, e.g. the `AzureContextState`, should likely be refactored to use the object cache instead).
