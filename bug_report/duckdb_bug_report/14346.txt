Title: [Appender] Support appending to table with generated columns
Description:
This PR fixes #14343 

The chunk we create and fill for a table in the Appender should not contain Vectors for generated columns, these are added later in the LocalAppend call.

Now they are ignored and no longer cause a "Call to EndRow before all columns have been appended to!" error.
