Title: Automatically call `malloc_trim` to reduce unused outstanding allocations
Description:
After attaching and detaching many databases, DuckDB would hold onto many gigabytes of memory on Linux machines. [This is a well-known phenomenon of the GNU allocator](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/when-allocators-are-hoarding-your-precious-memory/). We can release the memory to the OS by calling `malloc_trim`, which brings the memory down to a few KB.

This PR adds `malloc_trim` to our allocation flushing methods to properly release memory to the OS and reduce our RSS.

I've also fixed a compile warning for Linux in `json_create.cpp`.
