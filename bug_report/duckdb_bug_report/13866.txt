Title: FTS ignore regex to include single quote
Description:
### What happens?

When trying to create a duckdb FTS index with single quotes included in the search regex, the following error occurs
```
con.execute("PRAGMA create_fts_index(my_table, 'CustomerId', 'CustomerName', ignore='(\\.|[^a-z0-9'])+')")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
duckdb.duckdb.ParserException: Parser Error: syntax error at or near "]"
```


### To Reproduce

```
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect("tester.db")
con.execute("CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT 1 AS CustomerId, 'hans' as CustomerName")

# FTS Index creation to include search for lowercase alphanumeric characters and single quotes
con.execute("PRAGMA create_fts_index(my_table, 'CustomerId', 'CustomerName', ignore='(\\.|[^a-z0-9'])+')")

# Trying to escape the single quotes as well does not seem to work with PRAGMA
# Escape with single `\`
con.execute("PRAGMA create_fts_index(my_table, 'CustomerId', 'CustomerName', ignore='(\\.|[^a-z0-9\'])+')")
# Escape with double `\`
con.execute("PRAGMA create_fts_index(my_table, 'CustomerId', 'CustomerName', ignore='(\\.|[^a-z0-9\\'])+')")
```
