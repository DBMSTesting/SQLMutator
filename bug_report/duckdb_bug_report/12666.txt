Title: _LIBCPP_ASSERT_SEMANTIC_REQUIREMENT assertion failure
Description:
### What happens?

I get a SIGABRT on this line:          

```
 _LIBCPP_ASSERT_SEMANTIC_REQUIREMENT(
              !__comp(*(__first + __a), *(__first + __b)), "Your comparator is not a valid strict-weak ordering");

```
in the standard library. It is called from:

```
	//! Neighbors should be reversed when iterating over them.
	std::sort(neighbors.begin(), neighbors.end(), std::greater_equal<idx_t>());

```
in 

`bool PlanEnumerator::EmitCSG(JoinRelationSet &node).
`
The code I use to query is:

```
      let testquery = try! expressionDbConnection.query(
"""
SELECT
  entry.id AS entry_id
FROM
  entry
  JOIN sense ON sense.id_entry = entry.id
""")
```

I compile in debug mode.

### To Reproduce

Call

```
      let testquery = try! expressionDbConnection.query(
"""
SELECT
  entry.id AS entry_id
FROM
  entry
  JOIN sense ON sense.id_entry = entry.id
""")
```
in debug mode.
