Title: Handle extension ABI mismatches in a forward & backward compatible way
Description:
This PR do not introduces behaviour changes for working paths, but improve error messages when extensions are mixed between different incompatible DuckDB versions.

In particular, opening extensions with no ABI specified still reads them as C++-based extensions, and opening extensions with unknown ABI (say we add more of them later) have the ABI logged to user as part of the error message.

Also moving an implementation function to `noexcept`, should likely be done in more places, but can be done independenlty.
