Title: Update rapidfuzz
Description:
Updates from some code extracted from rapidfuzz to a recent version of the library. This has nearly zero immediate user-facing impact (see the one changed test case for a way the newer version brings us in line with other implementations), but paves the way for https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/10345, which I can add in a follow-up PR.
