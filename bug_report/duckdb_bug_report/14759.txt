Title: Optimistic writes: flush the last row group in all scenarios
Description:
When optimistically writing data to disk - there were a few scenarios in which we would not optimistically write row groups:

* For batch insert, when the batches were approximately as large as our internal row group size, we would not always flush them as the `CollectionMerger` would have a collection with a single `ColumnDataCollection` in it
* For regular insert, we would not flush the last row group in `Combine`

For regular insertions, this would not have a large impact as most data would still be written optimistically - but for the optimistic WAL write added in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13372 we need **all** row groups written in sequence to be optimistically written out. By not flushing all row groups, large WAL files would still be created.
