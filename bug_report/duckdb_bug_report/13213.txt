Title: INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast
Description:
### What happens?

I'm getting an internal error on a DELETE transaction:
```
INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast: value 58.982394 outside of target range [58.000000, 58.000000]
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors
```


### To Reproduce

To reproduce:

```
~/git-sandbox/duckdb (main)$ ./build/duckdb
v1.0.1-dev3542 22040decf7
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D .open foodb
D create table foo  (d double);
D begin;
D insert into foo select random() from generate_series(1, 10000000) g(g);
100% ▕████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▏ 
D commit;
D begin;
D delete from foo;
INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast: value 58.982394 outside of target range [58.000000, 58.000000]
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.

```

The database doesn't exist previously, this is a fully-contained example.
