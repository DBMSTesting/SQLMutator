Title: Missing PageEncodingStats in the parquet files created by duckdb
Description:
### What happens?

I am facing an issue while splitting a parquet file generated by DuckDB into multiple files using the parquet-hadoop Java library. 
The Java library could not set the dictionary page offsets correctly in the new files. When investigated further, I observed that the parquet-hadoop Java library depends on encoding stats to set the dictionary page offset correctly, but the parquet file created by DuckDB does not have any encoding stats saved in the footer. 

Below is the footer of the parquet file created by DuckDB (generated using parquet-cli (https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/tree/master/parquet-cli):

```{
  "created_by" : "DuckDB",
  "num_rows" : 1001,
  "row_groups" : [ {
    "columns" : [ {
      "file_offset" : 0,
      "meta_data" : {
        "codec" : 1,
        "data_page_offset" : 157,
        "dictionary_page_offset" : 4,
        "encodings" : [ 0, 8 ],
        "num_values" : 1001,
        "path_in_schema" : [ "X" ],
        "statistics" : {
          "distinct_count" : 32,
          "max" : "9",
          "max_value" : "9",
          "min" : "0",
          "min_value" : "0",
          "null_count" : 0
        },
        "total_compressed_size" : 344,
        "total_uncompressed_size" : 2227,
        "type" : 6
      }
    } ],
    "file_offset" : 4,
    "num_rows" : 1001,
    "total_byte_size" : 33024
  } ],
  "schema" : [ {
    "name" : "duckdb_schema",
    "num_children" : 1,
    "repetition_type" : 0
  }, {
    "converted_type" : 0,
    "name" : "X",
    "repetition_type" : 1,
    "type" : 6
  } ],
  "version" : 1
}

```



### To Reproduce

```
COPY (
      SELECT
         CAST(generate_series % 32 AS STRING) as X 
      FROM
       generate_series(1000)
    ) TO 'test.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);

```
