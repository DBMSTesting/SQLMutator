Title: [Fix] release shared connection pointer before it goes out of scope
Description:
We get occasional segfaults inside close in a multithreaded, loaded application.
gil_scoped_acquire is destroyed before the shared pointer.
In cases where the shared_pointer had become the final reference the destructor is called without holding the GIL.
