Title: Continue download request if HTTP server is not honoring RANGE requests
Description:
Allow httpfs to continue download attempt when target server is not honoring / supporting RANGE requests.

Per the RFC, it's valid for a server to IGNORE *range* headers and return 200 instead.
This patch continues the expected logic when a 200 is found instead of the expected 206.

The server mentioned at #14837  is also providing CHUNK responses.

Closes: #14837
