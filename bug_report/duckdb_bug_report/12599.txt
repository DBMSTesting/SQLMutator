Title: [Relation API] Dont push DISTINCT modifier for EXCEPT/INTERSECT ALL
Description:
This PR fixes #12592 

The ALL variation of a SET OPERATION should have bag semantics.
Previously we pushed a DISTINCT for all except/intersect SetOpRelations, presumably this is because `setop_all` did not exist at the time.
