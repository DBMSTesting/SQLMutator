Title: Support unlimited precision in JSON by using yyjson "raw" values
Description:
Fixes #15038

When this was originally implemented, yyjson did not yet support "raw" values, so the only option was to cast to double (potentially losing precision) or to quote large numbers (making them a string). Now, we can write these numbers as "raw" which does not lose any precision and keeps them numerical.
