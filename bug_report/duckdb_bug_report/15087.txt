Title: Top-N: Perform global boundary checking before doing sort-key conversion
Description:
This PR is essentially a partial revert of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14424 - that fixes a performance regression that was caused by the Top-N operator doing the global boundary checking **after** constructing the sort key, instead of before. This meant that, even for rows where we would be certain they would not be added to the heap, we would be constructing sort keys. This PR brings back the old code that allows the boundary values to be checked directly on the sort keys. In order to facilitate this, we deserialize the global boundary value (stored as a sort key) back into a `DataChunk` that can be compared against directly.
