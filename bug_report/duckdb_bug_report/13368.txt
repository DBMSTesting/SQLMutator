Title: Add http proxy
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/3836.

This PR's main goals is to expose http proxy and http_proxy credentials using basic auth in DuckDB. Along the way I added a few bits and bobs. 

This PR includes:

- a new `http` secret type which has
	- http proxy config
	- custom http headers
	- custom bearer token
- added some tests for the http proxy using squid (similar to whats used to test this in the azure extension)
- I removed the unused bearer token secret type in favor of the new `http` secret type
- MAP type is now supported as a value type in a `CREATE SECRET` statement
- Fix encoding issue for globbing a huggingface url with slashes in the ref name.


# Examples:

Add http proxy through settings:
```
set http_proxy='duckdb.org:1337'
from 'https://mah-server/some-file.parquet' 
```
 Add http proxy through secret:
```
CREATE SECRET http3 (
    TYPE HTTP, 
    http_proxy '${HTTP_PROXY_PRIVATE}',
    http_proxy_username 'john',
    http_proxy_password 'doe'
);
from 'https://mah-server/some-file.parquet'
```

Add custom header map
```
CREATE SECRET http3 (
    TYPE HTTP, 
    EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS MAP{
		'Authorization': 'Bearer ${my token}',
		'my_own_header': 'my_special_value'
	}
);
from 'https://mah-server/some-file.parquet'
```
