Title: Add TPCDS sf-100 benchmarks
Description:
As it was mentioned by @Tmonster, for TPCDS regression tests, we also need to add the large benchmarks to the duckdb/duckdb repository.

This PR adds 22 TPCDS sf100 benchmarks (with answers).

UPD. Some queries showed INCORRECT result because of ordering by NULL (q18, q71, q72, q73) and couple of them TIMEOUT (q22, q67), so after discussing it with @Tmonster I modified also their queries (`ORDER BY ALL`) and updated answers.
Answers on the modifies queries were also updated for the sf1 and sf0.01.
For the time outing queries support of `--disable-timeout` parameter in `scripts/regression_test_runner.py` had been added.
