Title: Fix many backwards compatibility issues when serializing query plans between DuckDB v1.0 and main
Description:
This PR fixes a number of backwards compatibility issues when deserializing plans with main that were serialized with DuckDB v1.0.

* Change `UNNEST` parameter to `ALL` so we can bind the legacy `TABLE` parameter - check type in the bind
* Revert type removal of `quantile` functions
* Add new arguments for `duckdb_indexes`/`duckdb_constraints` to the end of the parameter list
* Only override return type in deserialization if it is not a complete type - otherwise verify that the type is correct instead
* Add a default value to the `comment` parameter for the CSV reader

This PR also lays the groundwork for setting up a CI job that runs these on all tests. The test script is extended so that it can run on all tests, and we have added a new `excluded_test.list` with tests that need to be skipped for a variety of reasons. All remaining tests now work, and new tests will be tested automatically. All that remains is setting up a CI job that actually runs these as part of the nightly, but this can be done in a separate PR.
