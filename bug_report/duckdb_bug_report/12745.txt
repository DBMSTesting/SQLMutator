Title: Fixes warnings detected by cppcheck
Description:
I believe initialization of buffers to null should avoid reading from uninitialized memory. This is hard to demonstrate, since initialization might be done elsewhere, but in that case compiler might get initialization out of the way.

Returning references to temporary objects is more clearly an error, I believe those methods where not really used, but given I saw this it might make sense to remove the problem.
