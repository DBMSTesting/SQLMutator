Title: Python UDF with struct return type has incorrect result
Description:
### What happens?

The results of a Python UDF returning a struct seem to sometimes have the struct fields and values shuffled.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb


con = duckdb.connect()


def example():
    return {
        "country": "country",
        "postal_code": "postal_code",
        "state": "state",
        "city": "city",
        "street2": "street2",
        "street1": "street1",
    }


return_type = """
STRUCT(
    "street1" STRING,
    "street2" STRING,
    "city" STRING,
    "state" STRING,
    "postal_code" STRING,
    "country" STRING
)
"""

con.create_function("example", example, return_type=return_type)


sol = example()
(res,) = con.sql("SELECT example()").fetchone()

assert res == sol
```
