Title: Clean up ChunkInfo when cleaning up a transaction
Description:
When appending to a table, we keep track of which transaction appended which rows using transaction identifiers in order to provide isolation between transactions. There are two modes for this: `ChunkConstantInfo` - for appends of at least `2048` rows, and `ChunkVectorInfo`, which keeps track of transaction identifiers for individual rows. When appending small amounts of rows (e.g. 1000 rows) at a time, we would create the individual row-by-row transaction identifiers. These transaction identifiers would not be cleaned up or merged until a restart - which could lead to many of these transaction identifiers being kept around even when not required. 

This PR adds a new `CleanupAppend` function that performs merging or cleaning up of these transaction identifiers when all transactions that need them have been closed. This prevents increasing memory consumption when doing many small insertions to a table.
