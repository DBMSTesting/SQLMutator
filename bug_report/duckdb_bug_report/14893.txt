Title: Fix arrow table filters
Description:

After looking at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14864, I realized we aren't handling optional filters in arrow scans very well. We filter them out before transform filter, when they should be filtered out in transform filter. Since InFilters are pushed as  children of optional filters, we should not check them in Transform Filter. The switch should be a white-list for what is allowed, and the default case should throw at every other filter type.

Also added tests to catch In filter pushdown. Both from `IN` and from joins.
