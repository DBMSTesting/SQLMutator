Title: Parentheses-free functions are still being called when using quoted identifiers
Description:
### What happens?

Special functions that don't require parentheses for PostgreSQL compatibility reasons (I _detest_ those functions because they permanently trip me up, but that's a [different topic](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/15760)) are still being called when wrapped in quotes, which makes them unescapable.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT
    "localtime", 
    "current_time", 
    "current_date"
```
```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│  localtime   │ current_time │ current_date │
│     time     │     time     │     date     │
├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ 17:58:37.477 │ 17:58:37.477 │ 2025-01-17   │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

PostgreSQL doesn't do this:
