Title: Can not cast field type to Int64 when querying nullable Int64 fields from a Pandas.DataFrame
Description:
### What happens?

As indicated in the title and attachment, even when using the cast function, it is impossible to maintain the cc_id in the dataframe returned by duckdb.query as Int64; the cc_id has been converted to a float64 type.

### To Reproduce

```
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'cc_id': pd.Series([1844743171901218817, 1844691776961568771, None, None], dtype='Int64'),
    'other_column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
})

result = duckdb.query("SELECT CAST(cc_id AS Int64) AS cc_id, other_column FROM df WHERE other_column > 10").df()
result['cc_id']
```
