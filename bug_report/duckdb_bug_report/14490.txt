Title: Inability to write to parquet file when filename is stored as VARIABLE
Description:
### What happens?

While storing the path of a local file in a `VARIABLE` works great for `read_parquet`/`read_csv`, it's impossible to use it when exporting data.

### To Reproduce

```
CREATE TABLE sample_table (
    sample_column TEXT
);

INSERT INTO sample_table (sample_column)
VALUES ('Row 1'), ('Row 2');

SET VARIABLE filename = 'local_file.parquet';
-- Line below works fine
COPY (SELECT * FROM sample_table) TO 'local_file.parquet';
-- Line below fails with 
-- Parser Error: syntax error at or near "'filename'"
-- LINE 1: ...CT * FROM sample_table) TO getvariable('filename');
COPY (SELECT * FROM sample_table) TO getvariable('filename');
```

This is not the case for `read_parquet` as this can handle variables fine. Same holds when reading/writing to csv too.
