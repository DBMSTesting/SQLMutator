### What happens?

Left join with subquery on empty tables causes substract overflow exception:

```cpp
if (!TrySubtractOperator::Operation(left, right, result)) {
	throw OutOfRangeException("Overflow in subtraction of %s (%s - %s)!", TypeIdToString(GetTypeId<TA>()),
			                        NumericHelper::ToString(left), NumericHelper::ToString(right));
}
```


### To Reproduce

```sql
create table t1 (id integer, revision integer, col integer);
create table t2 (id integer, revision integer, col1 integer);

select col, col1 from t1
  left join t2 on t1.id = t2.id
    and t1.revision = t2.revision
where t1.revision = (select max(z.revision) from t1 z where z.id = t1.id);
```
