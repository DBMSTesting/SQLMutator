Title: Importing Arrow extension type with metadata that is not a string/string map errors with `SerializationError`
Description:
### What happens?

When attempting to import an Arrow extension type that doesn't precisely parse into a `{"key": "value"}`, DuckDB throws a `SerializationError`. This includes extension types whose serialization is not JSON (not sure if there are any, but it's theoretically possible) or extension types whose serialization includes complex JSON (GeoArrow, whose CRS is rather deeply nested PROJJSON).

### To Reproduce

From Python with DuckDB 1.2.0:

```python
import duckdb
import pyarrow as pa

field = pa.field(
    "geometry",
    pa.binary(),
    metadata={
        "ARROW:extension:name": "foofyfoo",
        "ARROW:extension:metadata": 'this is not valid json',
    },
)
schema = pa.schema([field])
geo_table = pa.table(
    [pa.array([], pa.binary())],
    schema=schema,
)

# duckdb.sql("""SELECT s2_astext(geometry) as wkt FROM geo_table;""")
#> SerializationException: Serialization Error: Failed to parse JSON string: this is not valid json

field = pa.field(
    "geometry",
    pa.binary(),
    metadata={
        "ARROW:extension:name": "foofyfoo",
        "ARROW:extension:metadata": '{"key": {"complex": "value"}}',
    },
)
schema = pa.schema([field])
geo_table = pa.table(
    [pa.array([], pa.binary())],
    schema=schema,
)
duckdb.sql("""SELECT s2_astext(geometry) as wkt FROM geo_table;""")
#> SerializationException: Serialization Error: Failed to parse JSON string: {"key": {"complex": "value"}}
```
