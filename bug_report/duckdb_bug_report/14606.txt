Title: [Dev] Add `segment_size` to `pragma_storage_info`
Description:
This PR adds `segment_size` to `pragma_storage_info`, this cleanly communicates how much data is actually written by a compression algorithm.

The previous method of calculating this was to measure the distinct block_ids used and comparing those against another table.
This new method isn't entirely equivalent to the old method, as some fragmentation could cause blocks to not get fully used (when a block is >= 80% full it's no longer considered a suitable partial block to append to).

But in the compression ratio tests we usually increase the generated tuple count to counteract this noise anyways, measuring the actual footprint is probably a welcome change (?)

---------------------

Segments get updated / created in quite a couple different places. We already have `segment_size` which seems to always get ceilinged up to the block size, that I didn't want to mess with.
