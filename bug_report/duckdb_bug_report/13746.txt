Title: DuckDB returns different results on different OS
Description:
### What happens?

When running a simple statement on different OS Linux, Windows and MacOS the result can differ.
This frustrates unit tests.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SELECT ARRAY_DISTINCT(['A', 'A', 'B', NULL, NULL]) AS arr;
```

On my Linux and GitHub Linux, reliably I will get:
```
[B, A]
```

On my Windows VM and GitHub Windows, reliably I will get:
```
[A, B]
```

Although I have experimented already with all kind of configurations:
```java
        Properties info = new Properties();
        info.put("old_implicit_casting", "true");
        info.put("default_null_order", "NULLS FIRST");
        info.put("default_order", "ASC");
        info.put("memory_limit", "1GB");
        info.put("threads", "1");
```
