Title: Improve error on enums
Description:
Moving the error messages in cases of missing enum case to be more verbose, given this has basically no additional cost but grants some more information on what the system is doing at the moment the exception is thrown.

Before (using a bug that will be independently fixed in the meantime as example):
```
D LOAD '~/.duckdb/extensions/v1.0.0/osx_arm64/spatial.duckdb_extension';
Not implemented Error: Enum value: '' not implemented
```
After:
```
D LOAD '~/.duckdb/extensions/v1.0.0/osx_arm64/spatial.duckdb_extension';
Not implemented Error: Enum value: '' not implemented in FromString<ExtensionABIType>
```
```
