Title: Explicit windows-2019 instead of windows-latest
Description:
Using windows-latest meant defaulting to a recent Windows SDK, that caused issues such as https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13848 or https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13864

Issue is, at his core, that we were depending on a Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package that is not installed by default on Windows 2019.

Thanks everyone for reporting this, and @szarnyasg and @Mytherin for helping figuring this out.

This PR provide a way forward for build artifact that will be built, but also allow a blueprint (and the means) on how to rebuild `v1.1.0` release Windows artifacts, that will likely happen tomorrow. This will offer a solution after downloading new artifacts, after we can confirm they work.

Other duckdb repositories might have the same problem, and would need to be reviewed.
