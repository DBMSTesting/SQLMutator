Title: Spurious error when adding a scalar-valued equivalent to a table-valued function that returns a single-cell table, apparently triggered by a cast, 
Description:
### What happens?

merge_i() below is a table-valued function that nicely returns a single value in a single row,
but when I try to define a corresponding scalar function,
I get an error about `array_extract(INTEGER, "NULL")`;
this error is in turn triggered by the use of a cast --
specifically, the `merge` function's use of `listofsets[j]::INTEGER = []`.
If this expression is replaced by `true`, then the problem goes away.

The error message is:
```
Binder Error: No function matches the given name and argument types 'array_extract(INTEGER, "NULL")'. You might need to add explicit type casts.
```


### To Reproduce

```
create or replace function merge(listofsets, i, j) as (
  case when listofsets[j]::INTEGER[] = []
       then listofsets
       else listofsets
       end
);

create or replace function merge_i(listofsets, i) as table (
  with recursive cte(j,s) as (
    select i + 1, listofsets
    union all
    select j+1, merge(s, i, j)
    from cte
    where j <= length(listofsets)
  )
  select last(s) as s from cte
);

# This works:
from merge_i( [ [1,2], [2,3], [2,3,4] ], 1);

.print ... but even the act of defining merge_i_scalar as follows raises an error:
create or replace function merge_i_scalar(listofsets, i) as (
  select s from merge_i(listofsets, i) limit 1
);
```
