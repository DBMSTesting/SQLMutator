Title: Using GROUP BY ALL with a window function causes "Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!"
Description:
### What happens?

If you have an aggregated window function in your SELECT clause and use GROUP BY ALL, you get `Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!` even though listing out the group by fields works fine.

### To Reproduce

Create a simple addresses table (no data is necessary):
```sql
create table addresses (city varchar, street_name varchar, income int);
```
The following query works:
```sql
select
    city, street_name, sum(avg(income)) over (partition by city)
    from addresses group by city, street_name;
```
The following query:
```sql
select
    city, street_name, sum(avg(income)) over (partition by city)
    from addresses group by all;
```
causes
```text
Binder Error: Cannot mix aggregates with non-aggregated columns!
```
