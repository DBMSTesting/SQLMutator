Title: Fix duckdb_extensions() listing
Description:
Currently:
```
INSTALL tpcds;
LOAD tpcds;
FROM duckdb_extensions() WHERE extension_name = 'tpcds';
```
Do not show the extension as installed.

This was a problem only with `duckdb_extensions()`, not with INSTALL, LOAD or UPDATE codepaths, but seems a relevant piece to get right.
