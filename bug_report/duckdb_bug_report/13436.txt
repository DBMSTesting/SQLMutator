Title: JSON_TYPE function produces wrong result if path is a column expression
Description:
### What happens?

The `JSON_TYPE` function produces wrong results depending on how I'm passing the path argument

### To Reproduce

Run this query:

```sql
SELECT 
  json_type (json '{"a":1,"b":null}', p),
  json_type (json '{"a":1,"b":null}', 'b')
FROM (VALUES ('b')) AS t (p);
```

This produces:

```
|json_type(CAST('{"a":1,"b":null}' AS "json"), p)|json_type(CAST('{"a":1,"b":null}' AS "json"), 'b')|
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|                                                |NULL                                              |
```

The first result is wrong (SQL `NULL`). It should be just like the second result `'NULL'`
