Title: remove duplicate FastMem copies in binary
Description:
`FastMem` functions are marked with `static inline`. However `static` tellls compiler to generate one copy of function in every translation unit, and `FastMem` functions are too large to be inlined. So currently there are duplicate `FastMem` copies in duckdb's binary, even compiled with full LTO.

It can be checked by:
```
nm duckdb | grep FastMem 
0000000000f9a050 t _ZN6duckdbL10FastMemcmpEPKvS1_m
0000000001143d30 t _ZN6duckdbL10FastMemcmpEPKvS1_m
000000000129f4a0 t _ZN6duckdbL10FastMemcmpEPKvS1_m
0000000000f94800 t _ZN6duckdbL10FastMemcpyEPvPKvm
0000000000fb74d0 t _ZN6duckdbL10FastMemcpyEPvPKvm
0000000000fbccd0 t _ZN6duckdbL10FastMemsetEPvim
```

The better way is to use only `inline` instead. This slightly reduces binary size at about 30KB.
