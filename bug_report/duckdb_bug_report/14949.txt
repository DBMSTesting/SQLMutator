Title: [Python] DuckDB Spark API requires typing_extensions and numpy but they are not being installed
Description:
### What happens?

In, https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/tools/pythonpkg/setup.py no dependencies are specified (i.e. no `install_requires` is present). Hence, `pip install duckdb` will not install any dependencies. However, https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/tools/pythonpkg/duckdb/experimental/spark/_typing.py imports `numpy` and `typing_extensions`. Hence, if you install duckdb into a clean Python environment and use the Spark API, you'll get `ImportError`s.

DuckDB could either:
1. Use an [optional dependency group](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#optional-dependencies) so that these dependencies are installed with e.g. `pip install duckdb[sparkapi]`
2. Move both imports into `if TYPE_CHECKING` blocks. Not sure if this is best practice...
3. Add `typing_extensions` as a fix dependency, it's present in pretty much every Python environment anyway, I can't think of a downside of this? And then change that one type hint which uses numpy to import numpy in `if TYPE_CHECKING`

Happy to implement any of these or another option. I'd recommend the 3rd one as `typing_extensions` is super useful for Python packages which support older Python versions.
