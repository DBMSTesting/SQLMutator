Title: CLI Code Cleanup: rework metadata commands in the shell
Description:
This PR reworks the metadata commands in the shell so that they are structurally provided, instead of implemented as one linked-list:

```cpp
static const MetadataCommand metadata_commands[] = {
    {"backup", 0, nullptr, "?DB? FILE", "Backup DB (default \"main\") to FILE", 3},
    {"bail", 2, ToggleBail, "on|off", "Stop after hitting an error.  Default OFF", 3},
    {"binary", 2, ToggleBinary, "on|off", "Turn binary output on or off.  Default OFF", 3},
    {"cd", 2, ChangeDirectory, "DIRECTORY", "Change the working directory to DIRECTORY", 0},
    {"changes", 2, ToggleChanges, "on|off", "Show number of rows changed by SQL", 3},
    {"columns", 1, SetColumnRendering, "", "Column-wise rendering of query results", 0},
```

In addition, this PR also enables running the formatter on `shell.cpp`
