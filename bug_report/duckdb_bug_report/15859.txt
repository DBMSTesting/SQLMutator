Title: Remove `installed` column from duckdb extensions()
Description:
This is marginal, main advantage is that it allow smoothen up situation between native and duckdb-wasm in the Web use case.

In the case of DuckDB in a Web page, the concept of installed extensions is slightly different, since INSTALL basically registers an URL endpoint, but actual download happens lazily on load.

Plus currently we have multiple fields basically carrying similar informations:
* installed
* install_path
* install_mode

Of them the relevant one is `install_mode`, that carries informations about where the extension did came.

The last 2 are being set only when installed is `true`.

Plus this has been broken, so I guess that's information we can still get away with changing this.
