Title: Dynamically decide whether to do a Perfect Hash Join
Description:
Now that we dynamically compute the min/max for hash join builds, we can use this information to dynamically decide whether to do a perfect hash join (rather than statically while planning queries). The perfect hash join should trigger a lot more often.

I've had to remove `test/sql/join/inner/perfect_hash_join.test` because it checks whether the query plan contains a perfect hash join. However, now that we decide this dynamically, it cannot be printed in `PhysicalHashJoin::ParamsToString()`, as it is decided later than the function is called.

I guess we'll have to trust that the perfect HJ is still being triggered (I'm just kidding; the regression tests will clearly show when this breaksâ€”the perfect HJ should speed up TPC-H, possibly more).
