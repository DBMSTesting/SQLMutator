Title: [Dev] Add getters/setters for the 'column_ids' of a `LogicalGet`
Description:
This is being edited in various places, with no real way to track them or find examples easily in the code (as the `column_ids` name is used in quite a couple places)

I've made the `vector<column_t> column_ids;` private, introducing `GetColumnIds`, `GetMutableColumnIds`, `SetColumnIds` and `AddColumnId`.

`GetColumnIds` returns a `const vector<column_t> &`
Only in two places do we actually need `GetMutableColumnIds`, I think being explicit about this is an improvement.

In a couple other places I was able to add the missing `const` to fix the issues.

-----------------

Inspiration for this PR is that I was working on pushing a LogicalProjection onto a LogicalGet, using the `GetColumnBindings` method, which uses the `column_ids` vector - which is empty at construction.

Not being able to find out where this should be populated
