Title: Broken auto-casting JSON from VARCHAR into list elements - surplus quotes
Description:
### What happens?

When inserting a JSON list as a string into a LIST column, making use of the auto-casting inside DuckDB, then DuckDB will add surplus double quote characters to the list elements.

This results in wrong data being inserted into a table.


### To Reproduce

To reproduce, execute the following DuckDB SQL:
```
create table reproduce_json_thing
(
  my_value string[]
);

insert into reproduce_json_thing
select
  '[ "1", "2" ]' as my_value
;
```

The following query then should return an _empty_ result set:
```
select 
  unnested.*
from 
	reproduce_json_thing, 
	unnest(reproduce_json_thing.my_value) as unnested(val)
where
  unnested.val like '%"%'
;
```
It does return all inserted list elements with surplus double quotes, though.

Instead of inserting the literal `1`, the DuckDB defect is that it inserts `"1"`
