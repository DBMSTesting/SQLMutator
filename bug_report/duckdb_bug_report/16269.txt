Title: Avoid calling SetFilterAlwaysTrue multiple times in RowGroup::CheckZonemap
Description:
During row group checks - we keep track of which filters are always true (and hence do not need to be checked during the actual scan). Due to a missing `else` statement, we could call this method twice for the same filter.

Now this doesn't look problematic, but in `SetFilterAlwaysTrue` we *also* keep track of how many filters have been set as being always true - and if all filters are set as being always true, the filters are skipped entirely.

This can cause problems when optional filters (as e.g. constructed due to a Top-N) are combined with non-optional filters (as e.g. constructed through a `WHERE` clause). The filter would not be correctly executed - leading to incorrect rows sneaking into the result.
