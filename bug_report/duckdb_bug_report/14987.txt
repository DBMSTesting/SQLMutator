Title: Rely on extension-ci-tools workflow to build linux_amd64_gcc4 extensions
Description:
Idea is instead of executing whole workflow job containerized, that means that actions will be run within the container, that in turn means it's hard to  use older images since they will not have the required dependecies versions for the actions (in particular node 20).

Solution is to containerize explicitly the relevant tests in the workflow, invoking actions outside of the container in the regular image that powers the workflow.

Heavy lifting has been done by @samansmink in https://github.com/duckdb/extension-ci-tools/pull/79 and connected PRs.

This PR allows to avoid the need for ACTIONS_ALLOW_USE_UNSECURE_NODE_VERSION in Python CI.
