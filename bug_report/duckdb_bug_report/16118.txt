Title: v1.2 broke select from gzipped json
Description:
### What happens?

After upgrading to v1.2, reading a gzipped json file demanded a large increase in maximum object size and subsequently failed with invalid character. The same json without gzip compression reads fine in both v1.x and v1.2.

### To Reproduce

```
SELECT * FROM 'fundos_list.json.gz';
```
