Title: Inconsistent time vs. timetz behavior on different platforms (nightly)
Description:
### What happens?

As requested on Discord I'm creating an issue for the following:

In my CL bindings I haven't implemented `time_tz` yet, but I have a test for querying regular old `time` values:

```sql
SELECT t.time AS d , extract('hour' FROM t.time) AS hour , extract('minute' FROM t.time) AS minute , extract('microsecond' FROM t.time) AS microsecond FROM (SELECT current_time AS time) AS t
```

On nightly this returns `duckdb_type_time` for `d` on Linux, but on Windows and macOS it returns `duckdb_type_time_tz`. If I put in an explicit cast to `time` macOS returns `duckdb_type_time` as expected, but on Windows I still get `duckdb_type_time_tz`. I've seen this for quite a while on nightlies (maybe for a month).

I assume the types returned for the same query should be identical on all supported platforms. What is even more unexpected is that the explicit cast doesn't seem to have an effect on Windows.

### To Reproduce

Run the following query on different platforms via the C API and check the type for `d`:

```sql
SELECT t.time AS d , extract('hour' FROM t.time) AS hour , extract('minute' FROM t.time) AS minute , extract('microsecond' FROM t.time) AS microsecond FROM (SELECT current_time AS time) AS t
```
