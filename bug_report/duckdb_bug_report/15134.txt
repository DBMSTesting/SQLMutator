Title: Avoid cleaning up past releases if we have not just uploaded a new one
Description:
Currently Python CI did fail for 10 nights in a row due to multiple unconnected issues (mainly deprecation of ALLOW_UNSAFE_NODE and randomness that creept in) and that means that we do not have any installable `nightly` version via:
```
pip install duckdb --pre --upgrade
```
(currently will install only v1.1.3)

Solution is inverting the logic: cleanup is triggered only AFTER uploading something, that should guarantee that it never remains empty.
