Title: "Table with name [...] does not exist" when reading file that exists
Description:
### What happens?

Trying to read a zipped CSV file and getting an error that the file doesn't exist. I've verified it exists.

### To Reproduce

I'm trying to read a zipped CSV file from the DuckDB shell:

```
D select count(*) from '~/03nov2023.csv.zip';
```

but getting an error:

```sh
Catalog Error: Table with name ~/03nov2023.csv.zip does not exist!
Did you mean "temp.information_schema.schemata"?
LINE 1: select count(*) from '~/03nov2023.csv.zip';
```

I suspect that DuckDB may not like my ZIP file (or may not decompress ZIP files at all); if that's the case, I think the error message could be tweaked to say something like "DuckDB does not decompress ZIP files" rather than "the file doesn't exist". I'm new to the project, but happy to help contribute in any way I can ðŸ˜„
