Title: [Dev] Fix Roaring compression bug on appending small vectors
Description:
This PR fixes <https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3748>

Two issues with AppendVector:
- We were using `validity.GetValidityEntry(entry_idx)` where `entry_idx` is entirely based on `to_append` and does not account for offset within the validity, based on `appended`.
- We were not accounting for "ragged starts", which means the bits we care about are the top N bits of a validity entry, where the other `ValidityMask::BITS_PER_VALUE - N` bits are already processed.
