Title: [Dev] Make (previously implicit) assertion explicit for DuckTransactionManager
Description:
This will likely make the problem hit by #13022 surface much sooner

When creating a StorageExtension the extension has to provide a TransactionManager.
It is easy to reach for the regular DuckTransactionManager here, but that won't work because this expects the AttachedDatabase to have created the `unique_ptr<StorageManager> storage;` which will *only* happen for DuckCatalog's
