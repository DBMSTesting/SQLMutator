Title: read_json gives error with wildcard in path but succeeds without
Description:
### What happens?

Something weird is going on with `read_json` on `1.2.0`:

Running `select * FROM read_json('./data/mplus/receipt/*.json.gz');`

gives:

```
Invalid Input Error:
Malformed JSON in file "./data/mplus/receipt/1055147_a728f086d4849f6927dd06f40c2f37083fcf9ad41b63c683e617d0ad9bae9fd3.json.gz", at byte 3600875 in record/value 1003: unexpected character.
```

But if I run this file separately:

```sql
select activityId from read_json('./data/mplus/receipt/1055147_a728f086d4849f6927dd06f40c2f37083fcf9ad41b63c683e617d0ad9bae9fd3.json.gz');
```

it works!

Any idea what's causing this bug? If I read the error correctly it's processing record 1003, but the files only contain <= 1000 elements each, I double checked with `jq`.
