Title: [METRICS] Small fixes
Description:
Some small metrics-related fixes:
- `PRAGMA enable_profiling = 'no_output'` combined with `PRAGMA profiling_mode = 'detailed'` no longer prints an extra new line
- The test for `Physical Plan` and `Planner` metrics now creates a larger physical plan, so the `Physical Plan` timer always produces a time larger than zero
