Title: Bugfixes
Description:
Fixes:
1. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15695 by properly resetting file handle if table function is stopped early from outside `read_json` (as is the case with the recursive CTE in the issue)
2. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15696 by trying to parse the `"Last-Modified"` HTTP field, and ignoring the field entirely it if it fails (URL returns wrong format in the issue, but with this fix it still won't read because the URL doesn't support range requests)
3. https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/15641 by respecting the `FileLockType` on Windows instead of doing some default behavior
