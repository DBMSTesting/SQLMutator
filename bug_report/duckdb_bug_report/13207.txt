Title: [CSV Reader/Progress Bar] Fixes
Description:
This PR fixes the following issues:
1. A cast from double to integer in the progress bar would throw internal errors for very large csv files.
2. When searching for a new line position on new buffers, escaped values would try to insert into the result vector independent of the the type of that vector, causing an internal error.
3. Unnecessary error messages would be produced when trying to find a new line.
