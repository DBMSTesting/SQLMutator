Title: Assign memory to states in a specific order in `TemporaryMemoryManager`
Description:
Due to parallelism, the memory assignments in `TemporaryMemoryManager` are non-deterministic. While we cannot make it fully deterministic, we can make it more consistent.

When evaluating one large and one small join, we try to give the small join enough memory so that it does not need to spill to disk, at the cost of assigning less memory to the large join. However, if memory were assigned to the large join first, the small join would sometimes get less than we calculated it should. This would cause performance to be worse due to more disk spilling, but only if memory assignments happened in this order.

This PR addresses this problem by looping through `TemporaryMemoryState`s in a fixed order so that the "most important" states, such as smaller joins, get assigned memory before "less important" states. This should make performance consistent better when evaluating multiple memory-intensive joins simultaneously.
