Title: Calling read_csv on this https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-07/banklist.csv crashes DuckDB
Description:
### What happens?

When I call read_csv on the csv file https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-07/banklist.csv while passing parameters to ignore errors and store rejects, DuckDB CLIcrashes. No error is reported

With DuckDB WASM, it also crashes but I get at least an error message back:
```
Error: INTERNAL Error: Information loss on integer cast: value -3 outside of target range [0, -1]
This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic.
For more information, see https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/internal_errors

    at Fo.onMessage (worker_dispatcher.ts:202:51)
    at Wc.globalThis.onmessage (duckdb-browser-eh.worker.ts:29:19)
```
after this event, any subsequent access to the duckdb instance results in 
```
Error: FATAL Error: Failed: database has been invalidated because of a previous fatal error. The database must be restarted prior to being used again.
Original error: "Information loss on integer cast: value -3 outside of target range [0, -1]"
