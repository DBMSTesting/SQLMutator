Title: Result returned for incorrect sub-query
Description:
### What happens?

Result generated for incorrect sub-query : for eg. 
Reproduced on Live demo Duckdb Shell
```
select season_num from train_services;
Binder Error: Referenced column "season_num" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "train_services.station_name"
LINE 1: select season_num from train_services;
```

But this query runs fine on small data set, For large data set takes lot of time to run .
```
select * from t2 where episode_num in ( select season_num from train_services);
 1 ┆ 1 ┆ 1966-09-08  ┆ 0 ┆ 1 ┆ 0 ┆ 1 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 5 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 0 ┆ 1 
```

### To Reproduce

```
Create table t2 as from 's3://duckdb-blobs/data/Star_Trek-Season_1.csv';
CREATE TABLE train_services AS  FROM 's3://duckdb-blobs/train_services.parquet';
select * from t2 where episode_num in ( select season_num from train_services);  -- Executed Successfuly 
select season_num from train_services; -- Binder Error
```
This query should fail : select * from t2 where episode_num in ( select season_num from train_services);
