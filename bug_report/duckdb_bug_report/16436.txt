Title: Self-referential Foreign Key Causes Duplicate Primary Key Error on UPDATE
Description:
### What happens?

When using a self-referential foreign key in DuckDB, updating the foreign key column to reference the same row causes a Duplicate key "sid: 1" violates primary key constraint error. This behavior is unexpected since the row already exists and should be able to reference itself without violating the primary key constraint. Seems DuckDB is trying to insert a new row.

Expected Behavior:
The UPDATE statement should succeed, allowing the row to reference itself via the foreign key.

Actual Behavior:
DuckDB throws the following error:

```
Constraint Error: Duplicate key "sid: 1" violates primary key constraint.
If this is an unexpected constraint violation please double check with the known index limitations section in our documentation (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/indexes).
[SQL: UPDATE sid SET currency_sid = 1 WHERE sid = 1;]
```

### To Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
```
CREATE TABLE sid (
    sid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    sid_name VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    currency_sid INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (currency_sid) REFERENCES sid(sid)
);

INSERT INTO sid (sid, sid_name) VALUES (1, 'TEST_SID');
```

```
UPDATE sid SET currency_sid = 1 WHERE sid = 1;  # Error Here
```
