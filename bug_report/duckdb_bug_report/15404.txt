Title: [Dev] Checkpoint base + validity before finalizing both
Description:
This PR is a continuation on #15388 

Summary of the changes:
- The `SegmentLock` used to ensure safe access to the `ColumnSegmentTree` of the `ColumnData` is now held by the `ColumnCheckpointState`
This does mean that the lock is now held for the duration of the checkpoint, until it's released at the end of `RowGroup::Checkpoint`
- The `StandardColumnData` now interleaves the checkpointing of base+validity, meaning the old base data is still available to the validity when its being checkpointed.
- With `ALTERNATIVE_VERIFY` the validity checkpoint will now also scan the base data, just to verify that this is now possible (in a future PR (#15365) we will make use of this)

Some misc changes are made so the lock of the validity is being used
Previously the validity's `ColumnSegmentTree` was not already locked when `StandardColumnData` was checkpointing, so it grabbed the lock when it performed the scan, which would now result in a deadlock
