Title: No pushing filters below projections that cast to a lower logical type id
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12577

It was also important to realize that if the cast is to a higher logical type, than the filter can be pushed down, since all values of the lower logical type can always be cast to the higher logical type (i.e all INT values can be cast to VARCHAR values).

The other way around, however, does not work, and when such a cast occurs (i.e VARCHAR to INT) the filter cannot be pushed down.
