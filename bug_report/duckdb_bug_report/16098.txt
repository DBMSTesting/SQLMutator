Title: Window function range between 1 following and 1 following returns a result when it should not
Description:
### What happens?

The window function:
```
first (year_total) over (
        partition by
          sale_customer__id
        order by
          sale_date__year range between 1 following
          and 1 following
      ) 
```
returns values for some records when it should return NULL.

Further, running the query repeatedly returns different results each time.


### To Reproduce

Load the attached file.

Run the query:
```
select * from
(
  select
    sale_customer__id,
    year_total,
    next_year,
    (
      first (year_total) over (
        partition by
          sale_customer__id
        order by
          sale_date__year range between 1 following
          and 1 following
      ) 
    ) as recompute_next_year,
    sale_date__year
  from
    without_where_small
)
    where next_year is distinct from recompute_next_year;
```

In DuckDB 1.1.3 this always returns no records.
In DuckDB 1.2.0 this returns a various set of records.

You can recreate the without_where_small table if necessary with the following query:
```
create table without_where_small as
(
  select
    sale_customer__id,
    year_total,
    (
      first (year_total) over (
        partition by
          sale_customer__id
        order by
          sale_date__year range between 1 following
          and 1 following
      ) 
    ) as next_year,
    sale_date__year
  from
    year_total_small
);
```
