Title: Fix shared_ptr issues in RowGroup and add locks to WAL initialization
Description:
Fixes issues found by thread sanitizer. `shared_ptr` objects *themselves* cannot be safely shared across threads on all implementations. Instead, we use an atomic pointer for atomic access, and the shared pointer is only modified behind a lock.
