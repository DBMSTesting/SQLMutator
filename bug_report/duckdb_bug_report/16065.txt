Title: calling some functions appear to interfere with read_csv processing
Description:
### What happens?

calling some functions appear to interfere with read_csv processing

### To Reproduce

This works as expected:
```
$ seq 3 | duckdb -csv -header  -c "with a as (select 'hello'), b as (from read_csv('/dev/stdin')) select * from a,b;"
"'hello'",column0
hello,1
hello,2
hello,3
```

However, changing the `'hello'` to a function such as `today()` produces no rows:

```
$ seq 3 | duckdb -csv -header  -c "with a as (select today()), b as (from read_csv('/dev/stdin')) select * from a,b;"
```

Similarly for other function I tried such as `current_catalog()`
