Title: Auto completion in v1.2.0 is adding a '.' to table names
Description:
### What happens?

When using tab completion on a table name without a qualifying schema name, an extra '.' is being appended to the completed name

e.g.

🦆🦆🦆 > .tables
Russian_tax   reject_scans  rejects
🦆🦆🦆 > from russ

hitting tab now gives

🦆🦆🦆 > from russian_tax.  <-- extra '.' character

whereas

🦆🦆🦆 > from main.Russi

hitting tab now gives the correct

🦆🦆🦆 > from main.Russian_tax
