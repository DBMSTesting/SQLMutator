Title: [Dev] Made `reference<CompressionFunction> function` private in `ColumnSegment`
Description:
This PR is a follow up to a change made in #14878 

In that PR we changed `CreateTransientSegment` to require the CompressionFunction, because of that it is now always set by the constructor, making the deleted lines in every touched compression function obsolete.

Because of this I tried to downgrade the type from `reference<CompressionFunction>` to `const CompressionFunction &`
In doing so I discovered there is one place where it *does* actually need to change; when the stats say the segment is constant.

This change was made outside of the ColumnSegment, but it immediately calls into a method of the ColumnSegment where it has access to the required variables as well, so I moved the code and made the member private.

I think this should help in reasoning about the ColumnSegment, as it is now clear when and how the `function` member can change.
