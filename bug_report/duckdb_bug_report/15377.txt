Title: only delete unique row_ids
Description:
fixes: https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3702

It is possible to delete the same row multiple times within the one transaction. From a storage perspective, the deleted row stays deleted and there is no problem. From a user perspective that uses returning, the problem is that the returning statement will return the duplicated rows.

To fix this, we need to call `table.Delete` so we know how many rows were actually deleted. Since every row in a chunk passed to `PhysicalDelete::SINK` is deleted and we just want to avoid returning rows multiple times, we keep track of already deleted row_ids using the global state. If a row_id has not yet been deleted, add it to the returning_collection, if it has been deleted, ignore it.
