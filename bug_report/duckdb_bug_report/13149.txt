Title: [Python] Fix various issues uncovered by #12959
Description:
This PR references #12959

Namely points 1 and 5 have not been addressed by this PR.
Both of which are not trivially fixed.
1 because of the very overloaded responsibilities of the createDataFrame method.
5 because this is a problem at the Relation level.

Fixes are as follows:
- ColumnExpression can now be created with multiple names, to qualify the column with a table.
- (pyspark) DataFrame methods have been adjusted to return a non-ambiguous Column
- DuckDBPyRelation::Join has been adjusted to turn a list of strings into a USING clause
- `desc` and `asc` have been added to `spark.sql.functions`

Relation's constructor has been adjusted to take an `alias` parameter, this is now a private member of the Relation and is `const`.
Removing the need for `GetAlias`. The method has not been touched by this PR however.
