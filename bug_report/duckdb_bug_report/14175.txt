Title: Implement `map_extract_first`
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14167 - not a bug, but behavior is now different.

We used to auto-detect `STRUCT`, but we now auto-detect `MAP`, and dot-notation for extracting fields no longer works for certain inputs.

However, if we implement `map_extract_first` and rewrite dot-notation on `MAP`s to this function we can still do the previous behavior.

Since this is not a bugfix but somewhat of a feature we could consider pointing this to the `feature` branch instead.
