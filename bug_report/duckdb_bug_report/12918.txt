Title: Fix #12870 - improve error message when encountering schema mismatches in COPY tbl FROM file.parquet
Description:
Fix #12870

This PR improves the error message when there are schema mismatches when copying from Parquet files into a table.

e.g.:
```sql
D create table integers(i int);
D copy (select date '1992-01-01' d) to date.parquet;
D copy integers from date.parquet;
```

```
Conversion Error: In Parquet reader of file "date.parquet": failed to cast column "d" from type DATE to INTEGER: Unimplemented type for cast (DATE -> INTEGER)

In file "date.parquet" the column "d" has type DATE, but we are trying to load it into column "i" with type INTEGER.
This means the Parquet schema does not match the schema of the table.
Possible solutions:
* Insert by name instead of by position using "INSERT INTO tbl BY NAME SELECT * FROM read_parquet(...)"
* Manually specify which columns to insert using "INSERT INTO tbl SELECT ... FROM read_parquet(...)"
```

This requires an extra field in the `ParquetBindData`. In order to not break forwards compatibility we up the storage serialization version, and only serialize this extra field when the new storage serialization version is used.
