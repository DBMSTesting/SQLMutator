Title: [Julia] Import database
Description:
### What happens?

As posted on Discord, importing a database with multiple definitions does not seem to be supported within the Julia API, or is there a specific command to use ?



### To Reproduce

Step 1: create and export a database with multiple views, e.g. 
```
CREATE VIEW v1 AS (SELECT 1);
CREATE VIEW v2 AS (SELECT 2);
EXPORT DATABASE '/tmp/testdb';
```

Step 2. With the julia API, try to import it:
```
julia> DBInterface.execute(connection, "IMPORT DATABASE '/tmp/testdb'")
ERROR: Invalid Error: Cannot prepare multiple statements at once!
```
