Title: Unexpected values when using alias that happens to be a (joined) column name
Description:
### What happens?

Possibly related to: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13952

When referring to an alias that is also a column name in a joined table, the joined table column is used instead of the alias. See:

```
WITH CTE_years AS (
	SELECT 2022 AS "financialYear", 100 as "myInt", UNION ALL
	SELECT 2023 AS "financialYear", 200 as "myInt", UNION ALL
	SELECT 2024 AS "financialYear", 300 as "myInt",
), CTE_dates AS (
	SELECT '2022-03-01'::date AS "importantDate" UNION ALL
	SELECT '2023-05-01'::date AS "importantDate" UNION ALL
	SELECT '2024-07-01'::date AS "importantDate"
)
SELECT 	t1."importantDate"         AS "importantDate",
	"importantDate".YEAR()     AS "myInt",
	"myInt"+1                  AS "myIntPlusOne",
FROM CTE_dates AS t1
LEFT JOIN CTE_years AS t2
ON t1."importantDate".YEAR() = t2."financialYear";
```

This gives the following output:
```
importantDate	myInt	myIntPlusOne
2022-03-01	2.022	101
2023-05-01	2.023	201
2024-07-01	2.024	301
```

I expect `myIntPlusOne` to be referring my alias `myInt` that I just set (four digit year int). Not the column from the CTE (three digit int).

In this MWE it's clear what's going wrong, but when joining many wide parquet files, I'm unsure how to make use of an alias when it's also a column name in a joined dataset. Even if I pick unused aliases now, in the future the parquets might change and then the aliases are pointing to the incorrect column.
