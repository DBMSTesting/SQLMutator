Title: v1.2 ATTACH DATABASE not working?
Description:
### What happens?

Is there any difference in attach syntax in version 1.2?

```sql
.open "mydb.db";
create table mytable (C1 VARCHAR(10));
insert into mytable values ('a');
select * from mytable; -- 1 row
attach 'mynewdb.db' as TOMERGE;
create table TOMERGE.mytable (C1 VARCHAR(10));
insert into TOMERGE.mytable SELECT * FROM mytable;
select * from TOMERGE.mytable; -- no rows: error!
DETACH TOMERGE;
```
