Title: Initialize random_seed to silence warning on uninitialized variable
Description:
Example of failure: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/12700951834/job/35404617301

Here detection is likely off (to a degree, given I would expect random not to use the passed in content, but hard to say).
Given it costs nothing it's better to just initialize it.
