Title: Not correctly reading Cgroup V2 memory limit
Description:
### What happens?

When loading duckdb inside a docker container whose memory is limited with "--memory" option, maximum memory is set to 80% of the host's memory, not the available memory in the container.

172cfbf includes support for reading cgroups limits, but it isn't reading the limit inside the container.


### To Reproduce

```
import duckdb
print(duckdb.sql("select current_setting('memory_limit')"))
```

run this in a docker container with limited memory:

```
$ docker run -t -i --memory=16GB test:test python /script/strace-test.py
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ current_setting('memory_limit') │
│             varchar             │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ 49.9 GiB                        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

It's not specific to Python either, you can get the same behaviour with:

```
duckdb -s "select current_setting('memory_limit')"
```

The host machine has 64GB RAM, so this is the right number for the host, but not for the container.
