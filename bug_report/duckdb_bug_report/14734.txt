Title: DuckDB does not properly read TIMETZ types

### What happens?

The attached parquet file as a single TIMETZ column and DuckDB can not properly parse the timezone value. 
The parquet file viewed via https://dataconverter.io/view/parquet looks like this:

However, DuckDB returns the following:
```
D select * from 'timetz_column.parquet';
┌─────────────────────┐
│        col33        │
│ time with time zone │

└─────────────────────┘
```
