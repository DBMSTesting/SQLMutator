Title: Use IOException for failed fstat calls
Description:
We've been getting `INTERNAL EXCEPTION: Information loss on integer cast: value -1 outside of target range [0, -1]` when things were not quite right with the filesystem. Looking at core dumps, it became clear that calls to `LocalFileSystem::GetFileSize` were failing because the underlying `fstat` call was failing. As almost all callers of `LocalFileSystem::GetFileSize` were casting the result value from `int64_t` to `idx_t` (i.e. `NumericCast<idx_t>(fs.GetFileSize(*handle))`) this would result in the above cryptic exception.

Similar to other places in the LocalFileSystem class I've changed this now to throw an IOException instead, to make it clear what the actual failure is.
