Title: Initialize the grouping sets when there is a group by all to enable filter pushdown
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3316

The `GROUP BY ALL` doesn't add grouping sets to the logical aggregate like a regular `GROUP BY` does. 
The grouping sets indexes come from how many grouping expressions there are, and not how many group_indexes there are. This is because in the presence of a HAVING clause, the Having Binder will add another group by expression that is not picked up when the `groupby_all_indexes` are calculated.
