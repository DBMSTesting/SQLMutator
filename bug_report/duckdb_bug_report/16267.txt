Title: [Python Dev] Add the correct variant of the `-std=c++11` flag based on the compiler (MSVC or not)
Description:
This PR addresses https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16237

My local builds started failing because `-std=c++11` was missing, this should fix the issue for both flavors of compiler.
Please verify that this doesn't break the MSVC environment @cfis
