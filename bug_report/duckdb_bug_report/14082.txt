Title: Inserting a TIMESTAMPTZ into a TIMESTAMP column ignores the time zone
Description:
### What happens?

If I have a table with a TIMESTAMP column and I insert a timestamp that includes a timezone it ignores the timezone, so when I read the value and apply a time zone for presentation the values no longer make sense. My assumption was that the TIMESTAMP column was microseconds from epoch based on the docs, so inserting a timestamp with a timezone should still keep the same time since epoch if that's what we're storing

from the docs:
>Timestamps represent points in absolute time, usually called instants. DuckDB represents instants as the number of microseconds (µs) since 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00.




### To Reproduce

test case:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test(d TIMESTAMP, d2 TIMESTAMPTZ);

SET timezone = 'UTC';
INSERT INTO test(d, d2) VALUES(now(), now());

SET timezone = 'Australia/Sydney';
INSERT INTO test(d, d2) VALUES(now(), now());

SELECT
    d, d at TIME ZONE 'Australia/Sydney' as d_sydney,
    d2, d2 at TIME ZONE 'Australia/Sydney' as d2_sydney
FROM test;
```

output:

```
┌─────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│            d            │          d_sydney          │             d2             │        d2_sydney        │
│        timestamp        │  timestamp with time zone  │  timestamp with time zone  │        timestamp        │
├─────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ 2024-09-24 00:38:01.061 │ 2024-09-24 00:38:01.061+10 │ 2024-09-24 10:38:01.061+10 │ 2024-09-24 10:38:01.061 │
│ 2024-09-24 10:38:01.061 │ 2024-09-24 10:38:01.061+10 │ 2024-09-24 10:38:01.061+10 │ 2024-09-24 10:38:01.061 │
└─────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

My expectation is that the values for when we cast to the Sydney timezone match in both cases.
