Title: Remove iceberg, again
Description:
This is a revert of https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15456, that reintroduced it.

When building Boost::filesystem, an iceberg VCPKG's dependency, in the context of the linux_arm64 cross-compiled platform there is a funny dependency on a specific CMake version.

While investigating, it's saner to remove it from CI and avoid unneded failures.
