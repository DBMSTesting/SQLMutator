Title: information_schema.table_constraints and key_column_usage always list "memory" for table_catalog on ATTACHed databases
Description:
### What happens?

When using the `ATTACH` statement, the `information_schema.table_constraints` and `information_schema.key_column_usage` tables will always list `memory` for the `constraint_catalog` and `table_catalog`.

This makes it impossible to determine which attached database the constraints come from when multiple database files are attached, especially when some have some tables or constraints with the same names.

Thus making it not possible to read the full database schema from the `information_schema` of those attached databases.

### To Reproduce

First test behavior when starting duckdb with specified database which works correctly:
1. From command line run `duckdb test.db`  where test.db is a DuckDB file with some tables.
2. Run `select * from information_schema.table_constraints;`
3. Notice `constraint_catalog` and `table_catalog` for all tables from `test.db` are correctly listed as `test`
4. Same with `select * from information_schema.key_column_usage;`
5. Now try `select * from information_schema.tables;`
6. Notice `table_catalog` is correctly listed as `test`

Then check behavior when using `ATTACH`
1. From command line run `duckdb` 
2. Attach a `duckdb` database eg. `ATTACH 'test.db' as test`
3. Run `select * from information_schema.table_constraints;`
4. Notice `constraint_catalog` and `table_catalog` for all tables are listed as `memory`
7. Same with `select * from information_schema.key_column_usage;`
8. Now try `select * from information_schema.tables;`
9. Notice in this case `table_catalog` is correctly listed as `test`

(Didn't share data set because it is reproducible with any DuckDB database file that has tables with constraints.)
