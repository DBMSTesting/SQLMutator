Title: [easy] [no-op] Minor optimization on iterator lookup
Description:
While reading the code, I found these places does double lookup in the set / map container, while we could save the second lookup by (1) store the returned iterator for `find`; (2) leverage the `emplace` API provided by the container.

Reference to `emplace` API, which returns the iterator and whether the item is new:
