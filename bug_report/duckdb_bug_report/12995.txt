Title: Improve EXPLAIN output of Delim Joins and Delim Gets
Description:
This PR adds `idx` annotations to `DELIM_JOIN`, and `DELIM_SCAN` nodes in the explain output of queries. Similar to recursive and materialized CTEs, this makes it easier (or possible) to match a `DELIM_SCAN` with its dedicated `DELIM_JOIN`.
