Title: Please add table partitioning native support
Description:
### What happens?

I would like to have native table partitioning support like here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html

### To Reproduce

I guess you could split the table by adding a suffix e.g. 1 and inserting/importing data and doing mod 10 on e.g. date column, but it's not native support
