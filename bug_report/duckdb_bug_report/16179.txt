Title: unified names for duckdb-extensions
Description:
Currently, the naming pattern for DuckDB extensions is inconsistent with the naming pattern used for DuckDB binaries.
Specifically:
- Extension names:
```
linux-extensions-64
duckdb-extensions-${{ matrix.duckdb_arch }} (OSX and Wasm)
windows_amd64_mingw-extensions
```

This PR aligns the naming pattern for extensions across all platforms to use `duckdb-extensions-${{ matrix.duckdb_arch }}`
