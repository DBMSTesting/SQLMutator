Title: Remove outadated test that fails somehow randomly and doesn't add much
Description:
Test would fail randomly, probably depending on state of environment that is determined by order of executions of other tests.

Also, INET will move out of tree, so keeping this has not much value.

Example of failures (just today):

Linux extension building: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/10198460377/job/28255497134?pr=13219
