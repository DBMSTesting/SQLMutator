Title: [Python][Jupyter] Don't use `ExplainFormat::HTML` for `explain('analyze')`
Description:
This PR fixes #13926

For Jupyter we use the HTMLTreeRenderer (equivalent to `EXPLAIN(FORMAT HTML)` when `rel.explain()` is used.

The HTML format is not implemented for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` which causes an error to be thrown.
Now we no longer use the HTML format when `analyze` is provided to `rel.explain()`
