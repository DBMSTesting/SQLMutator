Title: add index plan callback to IndexType
Description:
This PR adds another hook to the `IndexType` class to allow indexes to control how the physical plan gets generated from a logical `CREATE INDEX` plan. 

Previously the `CreatePlan` for the `LogicalCreateIndex` operator was hard-coded to only plan `ART` indexes. Custom index types (such as those in vss and spatial) relies on optimizer extensions to "hijack" the query plan and replace the `LogicalCreateIndex` with e.g. `LogicalCreateHNSWIndex` before physical planning could begin. This hack and resulted in a lot of duplicated and very advanced code in these extensions, and also came with the unfortunate side effect that you could not create these index types at all if the optimizer was disabled.

This is just the first step in a larger extension index rework Im working on, and I want to make the interface here even tighter in the future by e.g. handling sorting/null filtering/expression type validation before we hand of control to the extension, as I think that is something that could be generalized and/or is interesting for most index types and is a bit complicated to do right now.
