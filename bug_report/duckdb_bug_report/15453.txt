Title: [Dev] Slight cleanup of `assert.hpp`
Description:
I was confirming whether or not `relassert` was running `DuckDBAssertInternal`, it does (though it looks like it somehow misses certain assertions because of optimizations(?))

Always found this condition a bit hard to read, so I separated it into separate lines, and also removed the use of `DUCKDB_USE_STANDARD_ASSERT`, since I could find no reference to this define anywhere else (setting or reading)
