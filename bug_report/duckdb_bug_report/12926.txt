Title: Inconsistent behavior when inserting date/time data from CSV into timestamptz column
Description:
### What happens?

When inserting data from a CSV file into a table with a `timestamptz` column, the behavior is inconsistent. Direct insertion from the CSV results in NULL values, while inserting through an intermediate table works correctly.
Use the following csv file:
[abc.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16157070/abc.csv)


### To Reproduce

```sql
-- This works correctly
SELECT * FROM 'abc.csv';

-- This results in NULL values for the timestamptz column
CREATE TABLE test (column0 timestamptz, column1 numeric, column2 numeric, column3 numeric);
INSERT INTO test SELECT * FROM 'abc.csv';

-- This works correctly
CREATE TABLE test2 AS SELECT * FROM 'abc.csv';
INSERT INTO test SELECT * FROM test2;
```
