Title: fixed length array conversion to arrow crashes beyond a certain size with `uint64` data type
Description:
### What happens?

Converting DuckDB's fixed length array to its arrow equivalent causes the Python process to crash. This seems to only happen around a size of 9,000 elements and only with the `uint64` data type.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb
duckdb.sql("select cast(repeat([0], 9000) as uint64[9000])").arrow()
```

output:

```
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  python
```

### OS:
