Title: Avoid schema changes with IF NOT EXISTS
Description:
We've noticed that repeated calls of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for the same table were causing catalog versions to go up (causing rebinds for other queries). As ORMs are frequently using this pattern to ensure that a table / schema exists before inserting data (i.e. packaging the CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS into the same TX as the INSERT statement), this led to rebinds happening all the time.
