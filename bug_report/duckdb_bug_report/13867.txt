Title: Random generator gives repeated results 
Description:
### What happens?

random() gives repeated results even when run only 100k times and single-threaded.

In comparison, numpy gives unique results even when asked for 100M random numbers.

### To Reproduce

```sql
SET THREADS to 1;
SELECT count() FROM (SELECT DISTINCT random() AS a FROM range(100_000));
```
```
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│        99998 │
└──────────────┘
```
