Title: [Python][Dev] Fix tests relying on undefined `exec` behavior
Description:
It seems `exec` can't directly make changes in the current frame that are reflected on the frame after `exec` ends.
This breaks on 3.13, instead we're moving the replacement scan into the `exec` call so the frame is definitely available.

These tests are testing how replacement scans behave on names that are keywords in DuckDB, which is why `exec` is used to programmatically create variables with these names (might be a little over engineered but the tests are easily extendable)
