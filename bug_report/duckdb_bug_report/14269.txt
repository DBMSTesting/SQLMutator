Title: Add support for pkg-config
Description:
DuckDB provides CMake package. It's useful to detect link options from projects that use CMake, Meson and so on as a build system. But there are build systems that don't support CMake package but support pkg-config.

pkg-config support is useful for projects that use those build systems.

This PR targets only libduckdb.so. libduckdb_static.a support is out-of-scope of this PR.
