Title: [Python] Add the SQLExpression method to the Expression API
Description:
This PR addresses some issues mentioned here:
#16418
#14696
#8469

With the `SQLExpression` method it's possible to create any arbitrary expression that would be possible through SQL.
This is identical to what happens under the hood with `rel.select('<some arbitrary expression list>')` only the result is wrapped in an `Expression` and can be used with the rest of the Expression API.
