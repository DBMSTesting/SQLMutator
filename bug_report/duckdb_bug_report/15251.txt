Title: Grouped aggregation performance improvements
Description:
I did some profiling and added a few performance improvements. Most notably:
1. Reducing the size of the HT during `Sink` if rows are wide (reduces cache misses)
2. Reducing the number of partitions if rows are wide (reduces cache misses)
3. Add an unpartitioned data collection for small appends (reduces partitioning overhead)

Other changes are pretty minor.

This should slightly improve performance for high-cardinality grouped aggregations.
