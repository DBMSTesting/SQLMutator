Title: Line dependent buffer
Description:
In this PR, we modify the buffer size to be dependent on the `max_line_size` option.

This ensures that our buffers are always appropriately sized when `max_line_size` is set correctly, allowing us to read CSV files with very large lines.

Summary:

By default:
- `max_line_size`: 2097152 bytes (~2MB)
- `buffer_size`: 16 * `max_line_size` (~32MB)
- `per_thread_bytes`: 4 * `max_line_size` (~8MB)

The `buffer_size` and `per_thread_bytes` will only be adjusted if `max_line_size` is set to a value larger than the default.
