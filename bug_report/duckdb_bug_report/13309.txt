Title: spark api import failed: Import "duckdb.experimental.spark.sql" could not be resolved
Description:
### What happens?

Cannot import `duckdb.experimental.spark.sql` (Even though I can see the path `/xxx/data_sync/lib/python3.10/site-packages/duckdb/experimental/spark` exists in my Python venv project folder)

![example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b91fbe3a-9992-4702-bea8-d74ec70e9f47)
 

### To Reproduce

the code is:
```
from duckdb.experimental.spark.sql import SparkSession as session
from duckdb.experimental.spark.sql.functions import lit, col

import duckdb

print(f"duckdb version {duckdb.__version__}")
cursor = duckdb.connect()
print(cursor.execute('SELECT 42').fetchall())

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DuckDB_Spark").getOrCreate()
```

The output:
```
(data_sync) ght@node1:~/hyiyang/pyproj/data_sync$ python data_query_duck.py 
duckdb version 1.0.0
[(42,)]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ght/hyiyang/pyproj/data_sync/data_query_duck.py", line 10, in <module>
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DuckDB_Spark").getOrCreate()
NameError: name 'SparkSession' is not defined
```

Env details:
```
(data_sync) ght@node1:~/hyiyang/pyproj/data_sync$ python --version
Python 3.10.12
(data_sync) ght@node1:~/hyiyang/pyproj/data_sync$ pip list | grep duckdb
duckdb                   1.0.0
(data_sync) ght@node1:~/hyiyang/pyproj/data_sync$ cat /etc/os-release 
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS"
```

Also tried the code in my laptop, which is WSL2 + Ubuntu 22, still the same error.
