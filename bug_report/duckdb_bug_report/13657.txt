Title: query hangs forever using views, completes immediately with equivalent tables
Description:
### What happens?

This code never finishes:

```python
import duckdb

create_tables = False
con = duckdb.connect()
con.sql("CALL dsdgen(sf=0.01)")
con.sql("COPY store_sales TO 'store_sales.parquet'")
con.sql("COPY customer_demographics TO 'customer_demographics.parquet'")
cd = con.read_parquet("customer_demographics.parquet")
ss = con.read_parquet("store_sales.parquet")

if create_tables:
    ss.create("ss")
    cd.create("cd")
else:
    ss.create_view("ss")
    cd.create_view("cd")

sql = """
SELECT
  t3.cd_marital_status
FROM ss AS t2
JOIN cd AS t3
  ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN cd AS t4
  ON t3.cd_marital_status <> t4.cd_marital_status
LIMIT 1
"""

print("starting query")

result = con.sql(sql)
result = result.arrow()
assert len(result) == 1
```

Additionally it starts to create an enormous `.tmp` directory that doesn't stop growing.

If I replace all the `read_parquet` calls with equivalent tables created with `CREATE TABLE` the query finishes immediately. Setting `create_tables = True` does that in the example.

### To Reproduce

```python
import duckdb

create_tables = False
con = duckdb.connect()
con.sql("CALL dsdgen(sf=0.01)")
con.sql("COPY store_sales TO 'store_sales.parquet'")
con.sql("COPY customer_demographics TO 'customer_demographics.parquet'")
cd = con.read_parquet("customer_demographics.parquet")
ss = con.read_parquet("store_sales.parquet")

if create_tables:
    ss.create("ss")
    cd.create("cd")
else:
    ss.create_view("ss")
    cd.create_view("cd")

sql = """
SELECT
  t3.cd_marital_status
FROM ss AS t2
JOIN cd AS t3
  ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN cd AS t4
  ON t3.cd_marital_status <> t4.cd_marital_status
LIMIT 1
"""

print("starting query")

result = con.sql(sql)
result = result.arrow()
assert len(result) == 1
```
