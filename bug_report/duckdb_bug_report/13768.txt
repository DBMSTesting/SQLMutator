Title: [Python] The GIL should not be held during the bind of a Relation
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2561

During bind, the MultiFileReader would make of the UnionByName::UnionCols method which spins up an executor that then hits the PyFileSystem (with the provided test).

Inside the `fsspec` LocalFileSystem the GIL is released and then grabbed again, but the main thread is still holding the GIL that was grabbed before binding began and is spinlocking until the execution is finished.
