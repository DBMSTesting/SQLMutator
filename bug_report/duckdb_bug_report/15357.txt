Title: [Dev] Fix erroneous assert in `ZSTD` scan for `LogicalTypeId::VARCHAR`
Description:
This PR fixes #15354 

Other assertions and the TypeIsSupported method:
```c++
bool ZSTDFun::TypeIsSupported(PhysicalType type) {
	return type == PhysicalType::VARCHAR;
}
```

All check for `PhysicalType::VARCHAR`, which is a wider net than `LogicalTypeId::VARCHAR`, causing this:
```c++
D_ASSERT(result.GetType().id() == LogicalTypeId::VARCHAR);
```

To (needlessly) panic when a BLOB or BITSTRING is encountered, when assertions are turned on (debug builds).
