Title: Slow join performance when adding a condition that applies to only the left table
Description:
### What happens?

When joining between two tables with a filter in the join condition that applies only to the left table we see very very poor performance. Without this filter the join is extremely fast, but with it the code becomes very slow. 

In the below example (after removing the 'explain' commands) the first query completes for me in less than a second, while the query with the filter in the join conditions runs for many minutes.

The explain plan shows that the query without the filter uses a fast `HASH_JOIN`, while the query with the filter uses a much slower `BLOCKWISE_NL_JOIN`.

This problem has been brought up before [here](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/10387) - and there are ways to get around this problem by restructuring the query with union statements - but this becomes impractical when we have queries with multiple joins that take this form. 

 I'm not familiar with the technical limitations that stops queries of this type from using a HASH_JOIN, but it would be helpful if the query planner was able to handle this type of query in a more efficient way.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS numbers AS (
    WITH setup AS (
        SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
    )
    SELECT
        row_number() over () as id
    FROM setup as a
    CROSS JOIN setup as c
    CROSS JOIN setup as d
    CROSS JOIN setup as e
    CROSS JOIN setup as f
    CROSS JOIN setup as g
    CROSS JOIN setup as h
    CROSS JOIN setup as i
    CROSS JOIN setup as j
    CROSS JOIN setup as k
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fizzbuzz AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        case when id % 15 == 0 then 'fizzbuzz'
            when id % 5 = 0 then 'buzz'
            when id % 3 = 0 then 'fizz'
            else null
        end as fizz_type
    FROM numbers
);
```

```sql
-- No filter in left join predicate - uses fast HASH_JOIN
EXPLAIN
SELECT
    *
FROM fizzbuzz
LEFT JOIN numbers
    ON numbers.id = fizzbuzz.id;
```

```sql
-- Has a filter on left join predicate - uses slow BLOCKWISE_NL_JOIN
EXPLAIN
SELECT
    *
FROM fizzbuzz
LEFT JOIN numbers
    ON numbers.id = fizzbuzz.id
    AND fizzbuzz.fizz_type in ('fizz', 'buzz');
```
