conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:', read_only=False)
conn.execute("INSTALL aws;")
conn.execute("INSTALL httpfs;")
conn.execute("LOAD aws;")
conn.execute("LOAD httpfs;")

# %%
aws_credentials = get_aws_credentials(profile="test-mlops")

command = f"""
CREATE SECRET secret1 (
    TYPE S3,
    KEY_ID '{aws_credentials["aws_access_key_id"]}',
    SECRET '{aws_credentials["aws_secret_access_key"]}',
