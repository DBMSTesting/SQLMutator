Title: FIX: Discrepancy Between Count and Sum Queries in SQL
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/3388

If a nested comparison happens between two constant vectors, where both values are note NULL, then the result must always be True or False. This follows Postgres syntax. Is also related to https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/14094

Changing the unnamed structure comparison test also follows Postgres syntax

```
select (NULL, 6)  <> (6, 5);
```
outputs
```
?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
```
