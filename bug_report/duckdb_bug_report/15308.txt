Title: Fix RelationStatisticsHelper to estimate table filters correctly
Description:
Follows from investigating https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15197

Since all table filters were created as a ConjunctionAND with a `IsNotNULL` Filter, the relation statistics helper assumed all table filters were conjunction AND filters and would bail if the table filter was not a ConjunctionAND filter.  https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15197 removed the need to add the `ISNOTNULL` filter, a side effect of this was that the table filters would not be used to estimate the cardinality of the tables. 

This PR fixes that. Let's see what the regressions do.
