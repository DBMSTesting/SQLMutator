Title: Check vector type in GetVectorScanType to avoid concurrent race when updating validity
Description:
When scanning a column, `GetVectorScanType` needs to be consistent between the validity column data and the top-level column data, otherwise an `InternalException` is thrown. As the return value of `GetVectorScanType` changes based on whether or not updates are found, this could cause an issue if an update was performed in between the scan of the top-level column data and the validity column data. This PR resolves that by checking if the result vector type was already set to a non-flat vector.
