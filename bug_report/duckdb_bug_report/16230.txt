Title: Pivot only supports single-argument aggregates
Description:
### What happens?

Aggregates with multiple arguments don't seem to be supported in PIVOT statements



Is it possible to support this? In the meantime this is possible to workaround, but it would be helpful.

### To Reproduce

```
INSERT INTO dummy_data VALUES
  ('A', 10, 2),
  ('A', 20, 4),
  ('B', 15, 1),
  ('B', 25, 3),
  ('C', 30, 5),
  ('C', 40, 2);

PIVOT dummy_data on category using weighted_avg(value, weight) as val;
```

throws this error:
```
Binder Error:
Columns can only be referenced within the aggregate of a PIVOT expression
```
