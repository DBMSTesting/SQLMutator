Title: Concurrency groups for R and Wasm
Description:
The latest nightly-build for `R` [was skipped](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/13275346242/job/37063805368) because `higher priority waiting request for 'InvokeCI' exists`. It happened because it was in common concurrency group, but it needs its own. 

This PR adds a concurrency groups for `R` and `Wasm` workflows (in `wasm` it was missing).
