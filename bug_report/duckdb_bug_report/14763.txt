Title: Not working: "A macro can query a Common Table Expression (CTE) / WITH clause that is in scope during execution"
Description:
### What happens?

According to the article at https://duckdb.org/2024/03/01/sql-gymnastics.html:

"A macro can query a Common Table Expression (CTE) / WITH clause that
is in scope during execution"

This does not seem to work (any longer) as can be seen by running
the program below; doing so produces:
```
┌────────────────┐
│  "version"()   │
│    varchar     │
├────────────────┤
│ v1.1.4-dev1693 │
└────────────────┘
Catalog Error: Table with name zz does not exist!
```


### To Reproduce

```
select version();

# The i-th row as a list
create or replace function ijTable2Row(m) as (
  select array_agg(value order by j)
  from zz
  where i = m
);

# Pretty-print the mxn matrix stored as an ij-table named zz
create or replace function ijTable_pp(m,n) as table (
  select ijTable2Row(i) as rowi
  from range(1, m+1) t(i)
  order by i
);

with zz as (select 1 as i, 1 as j, 1 as value)
from ijTable_pp(1,1);
```
