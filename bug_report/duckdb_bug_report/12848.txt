Title: Fix regression in Parquet reader `TryOpenNextFile`
Description:
For some time now we lazily expand the list of files, because it is better to expand complex glob patterns during execution. This has introduced a regression in opening files ahead while threads are waiting for the current file to be opened in `TryOpenNextFile`.

This function opens up to `<thread_count>` files ahead while waiting, up to the number of total files, of course. However, here, we assumed that the number of readers is equal to the number of total files, which is no longer true now that we lazily expand the list of files to be read. The fix is to also call `ResizeFiles` in this method as well.

This improves the performance of reading multiple remote files.
