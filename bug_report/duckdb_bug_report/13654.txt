Title: Improve secret deserialization error message
Description:
When a user interacts with the secret manager (secret creation or lookup) when a persistent secret exists of an unknown type, the query will fail. This is not really nice, but fixing it before 1.1 is not going to happen. This PR improves the error message to at least provide a hint to the user which file to delete to restore the state
