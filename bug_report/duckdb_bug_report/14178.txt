Title: [httpfs] R2 secrets now require a 'REGION' to be provided
Description:
### What happens?

In `1.0.0`, the following secret was enough to successfully import from an R2 bucket:

```sql
CREATE SECRET "r2_${bucketName}" (
    TYPE R2,
    ACCOUNT_ID '${accountId}',
    KEY_ID '${accessKeyId}',
    SECRET '${secretAccessKey}',
    SCOPE 'r2://${bucketName}',
    SESSION_TOKEN '${sessionToken}'
);
```

In `1.1.1`, attempting to import with this secret results in:

```
HTTP Error: HTTP GET error on '/${bucketName}/?encoding-type=url&list-type=2&prefix=${prefix}%2F' (HTTP 400)
```

Adding a `REGION` to the secret gets it working again:

```sql
CREATE SECRET "r2_${bucketName}" (
    TYPE R2,
    ACCOUNT_ID '${accountId}',
    KEY_ID '${accessKeyId}',
    SECRET '${secretAccessKey}',
    SCOPE 'r2://${bucketName}',
    SESSION_TOKEN '${sessionToken}',
    REGION: 'auto' 
);
```

### To Reproduce

Create an R2 bucket and applicable S3 secret. I've only tested with a session, scope, etc as seen above but guessing it should reproduce without.

Reason I say that is I'm guessing this is an inadvertent side-effect of #13167 (specifically https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13167/commits/c07dad437c721699ef5b005a3932a79a9bf0e97a), where the old default region was removed:

```diff
- empty_params.region = "us-east-1";
``` 

Note that [Cloudflare uses "us-east-1" as an alias for "auto"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/api/#bucket-region)

Create the secret

```
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE R2,
    KEY_ID 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
    SECRET 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',
    ACCOUNT_ID 'your-account-id-here' -- your 33 character hexadecimal account ID
);
```

Attempt to import

```
SELECT * FROM 'r2://my-bucket/file.parquet';
```
