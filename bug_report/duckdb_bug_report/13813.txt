Title: Unexpected result when using `IN` with `TIME` values
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test cases. The second query should return `true` since the value after casting is `12:34:56` and the IN expression should be evaluated to true. Besides, if the `false` is expected, its negation query should not be evaluated as `false`.


### To Reproduce

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
CREATE   TABLE  t1(c0 TIME WITH TIME ZONE);
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES ('12:34:56');

SELECT t1.c0 FROM t1; -- 12:34:56+08

SELECT (CAST(t1.c0 AS TIME) IN ('12:34:56')) FROM t1; -- false (unexpected)
SELECT NOT (CAST(t1.c0 AS TIME) IN ('12:34:56')) FROM t1; -- false

```
