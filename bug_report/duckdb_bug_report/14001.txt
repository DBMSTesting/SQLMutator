Title: `ignore_errors` parameter is causing data loss during `TOO MANY COLUMNS` error type
Description:
### What happens?

When using the `read_csv_auto()` function in 1.1.0, the `ignore_errors` parameter has strange behavior that didn't exist in 1.0.0. If a row within the CSV produces the `TOO MANY COLUMNS` error type, none of the other rows within the CSV are returned in the select query.

### To Reproduce

[Here is sample data I used in order to reproduce.](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17032405/mock_duckdb_test_data.csv)

```sql
CREATE VIEW test AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(
        'mock_duckdb_test_data.csv',
        header=True,
        ignore_errors=True
        );
```

Create a view with the sample data, and then query the results:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM test AS t;
```

- In 1.1.0, the line with the `extra_record` will have been added to the headers, and no other data is returned.
- In 1.0.0, as expected, the lines with errors are skipped and the good data is returned.

Additionally, if you add `store_rejects` when creating the view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW test AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(
        'mock_duckdb_test_data.csv',
        header=True,
        ignore_errors=True,
        store_rejects=True
        );
```

An internal error is returned:

`INTERNAL Error: Attempted to dereference unique_ptr that is NULL! This error signals an assertion failure within DuckDB. This usually occurs due to unexpected conditions or errors in the program's logic. For more information, see https:// duckdb. org/ docs/ dev/ internal_errors`
