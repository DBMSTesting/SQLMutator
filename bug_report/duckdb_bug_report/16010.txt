Title: Remove sampling functionality
Description:
Addresses https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/4110

Sampling has bad memory management right now, which is causing larger ingestions to fail. In the interest of releasing early next week, it's probably best that it is removed and later added when memory issues are resolved
