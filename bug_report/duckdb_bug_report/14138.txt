Title: Iterate over py::list objects by value instead of by reference.
Description:
`py::list` iterator has two implementations depending if pybind11 is compiled for cpython or pypy. For cpython the iterator returns essentially `PyObject*`, so taking a reference is not needed. For pypy, returned object is a temporary, so it requires that iteration happens by value instead of reference. Currently it's the only problem for building duckdb for pypy.
