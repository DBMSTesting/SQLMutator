Title: Have CSV Parellel tests on CI again
Description:
At some point one of the CI refactors, disabled the Parallel CSV Tests.

This PR makes the CI run it again, all tests are slow, and they take about ~20 seconds, so the extra flag is not really necessary.

The file `data/csv/mixed_new_line.csv` is breaking, but should be fixed with: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15959

Hence I'm skipping it for now.
