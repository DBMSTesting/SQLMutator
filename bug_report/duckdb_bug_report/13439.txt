Title: Avoid rounding errors and simplify memory assignments in `TemporaryMemoryManager`
Description:
I saw [an assertion failure in CI in the `TemporaryMemoryManager`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/10401273810/job/28803977429?pr=13433#step:6:3804), unrelated to, but triggered by [my open PR](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13433).

The assertion failed because the counts were slightly off, caused by rounding errors between `idx_t` to/from `double` casts and some counters being updated without holding the lock. I've updated the calculations to avoid rounding errors and simplified the memory assignments to ensure the assertions hold.
