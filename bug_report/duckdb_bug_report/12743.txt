Title: Conversion Error: Overflow exception in date/time -> timestamp conversion
Description:
### What happens?

When I try to query with `params` that are `datetime` with `tzinfo` I get `Conversion Error: Overflow exception in date/time -> timestamp conversion`.

Maybe this is a bug. Maybe its just not very clear from the documentation how to use datetime `params` with time zones.

I've tried searching the documentation and doing google search without luck.

### To Reproduce

Run

```python
from datetime import datetime

import duckdb
import pandas as pd
from pytz import timezone

ts_df = pd.DataFrame({ "ts": [pd.Timestamp('2024-01-01 00:00:00+0100', tz='Europe/Copenhagen'), pd.Timestamp('2024-01-02 00:00:00+0100', tz='Europe/Copenhagen')] })

query = "select * from ts_df where ts = $notationtime"
params = {"notationtime": datetime(2024, 1, 1),}
params_zoneinfo = {"notationtime": datetime(2024, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone("Europe/Copenhagen")),}

with duckdb.connect() as conn:
    conn.sql("set TimeZone = 'Europe/Copenhagen'")
    
    print(conn.sql(query, params=params).df())
    print(conn.sql(query, params=params_zoneinfo).df())
```

and see

```bash
$ python script.py
                         ts
0 2024-01-01 00:00:00+01:00

          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
