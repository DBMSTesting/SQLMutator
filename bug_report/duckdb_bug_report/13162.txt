Title: [CSV Reader] Comment Option
Description:
This PR adds a `comment` option to the CSV Reader.

The idea is to have the same functionality as Pandas, hence the comment is a "character indicating that the remainder of line should not be parsed. If found at the beginning of a line, the line will be ignored altogether. This parameter must be a single character. Fully commented lines are ignored by the parameter `header` but not by `skiprows`. For example, if comment='#', parsing `#empty\na,b,c\n1,2,3`  will result in 'a,b,c' being treated as the header." ([source](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html))

This PR also adds sniffing of comments. It is currently limited to checking the possibility of applying `#` automatically as an option, but it's easy to extend this to more options if necessary.

It also adds many tests, including tests with different buffer sizes, and combinations with potential problematic options (i.e., `ignore_errors`, `skip_rows`, `store_rejects`).

Fix: #12746
