Title: Regression: Spurious error when adding a scalar-valued equivalent to a table-valued function that returns a single-cell table
Description:
### What happens?

The following program used to work in v1.0.0 1f98600c2c, but in v1.1.0 fa5c2fe and v1.1.3-dev38 it gives an error:
```
Binder Error: ARRAY_SLICE can only operate on LISTs and VARCHARs
```

Please note that I'm aware that adding type declarations in shuffle()
is a workaround.

The problem also arises if quiescence_table() itself is
declared and used as a scalar function.  In fact, that is the core
problem here: previously one could readily change a 1x1 table-valued
function into a scalar function, but this has become impossible
(without adding unwanted type declarations) in cases such as this.

(This error is similar to the one reported at https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/14236
but in that case, the program also fails using v1.0.0.)


### To Reproduce

```
create or replace function shuffle(lst) as lst[2:] || lst[1:1];

create or replace function quiescence_table(start) as table (
  with recursive cte as (
    select shuffle(start) as state, 1 as n
    union all
    select shuffle(state) as state, n+1 as n
    from cte
    where state != start
  )
  select last(n) as n
  from cte
);  

create or replace function quiescence(start) as (
  select n from quiescence_table(start)
);  

select quiescence([1,2,3]);
```
