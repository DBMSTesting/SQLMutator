Title: Fix script/regression/benchmark.py rework
Description:
Avoid running whole list of tests, but tests only failed ones

I think #14557 reworked the benchmark runner, but the old behaviour that was only regressions where iterated on was not kept.
Basically, you run 100 tests, 3 fails, only those 3 needs to be re-run (up to 5 times in total).
