Title: Added query progress callback
Description:
Currently we can get query progress with the `duckdb_query_progress` function but we need to poll it during the query execution. This PR adds `duckdb_set_progress_callback` function that we can use to register a callback that will be executed whenever query progress changes.

@Mytherin If you think this is worth adding, I'll add the function to the header generation files.
