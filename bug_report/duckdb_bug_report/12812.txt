Title: [Python] Accept a list of `Expression` objects in `DuckDBPyRelation.aggregate`
Description:
This PR fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2007

`aggregate` used to only accept a `str`, this adds the ability to provide a `list` of [`Expression`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/8469) objects while preserving the old behavior.
