Title: discussions #15981: remove confusing comment in "duckdb/tools/shell/shell.cpp"
Description:
Currently, a comment of the first line in "duckdb/tools/shell/shell.cpp" is wrote "/* DO NOT EDIT!". 
However, "duckdb/tools/shell/shell.cpp" has been many modified in actually.

I guess this comment confuse to new outside contributors.
So, I remove this comment in this modification.
