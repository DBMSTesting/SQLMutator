Title: [Python] Dont use the new `__arrow_c_stream__` for Polars when scanning `DataFrame` or `LazyFrame`
Description:
This PR fixes #13793 

An additional fix might need to be made so executing a relation made from an arrow_scan created from an object that provides the `__arrow_c_stream__` method does not trigger an error.

That currently throws an InternalException which is definitely not great, so that should at the minimal be downgraded to an InvalidInputException.

A further step could be to make it so that these relations can actually be executed multiple times, but that has lower priority in my opinion.
