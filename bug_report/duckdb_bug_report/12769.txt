Title: Fewer system calls in LocalFileSystem::ListFiles
Description:
In `LocalFileSystem::ListFiles` there are a few too many syscalls that are not actually required for correctness.

* We would call `DirectoryExists`, followed by `opendir` - but [opendir](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/opendir.3.html) already returns a `nullptr` if the directory does not exist.
* We would call `access` with `F_OK` (literal 0) to test for the existence of a file followed by `stat`, but [stat](https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat) returns `-1` if the file does not exist.

Removing these syscalls speeds up globbing by around ~10% on my macbook:

```sql
select count(*) from glob('**');
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│        70452 │
└──────────────┘
