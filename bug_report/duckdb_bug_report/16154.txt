Title: Fixes for CSV AFL Issues
Description:
There are mainly two fixes in this PR:

1. If buffer_size = 1, this could cause an error when calculating buffer sizes for decoding.
2. If the buffer size is set, the maximum line size should be equal to or smaller than the buffer size (a line can never be larger than the buffer). I've adjusted the code to handle this automatically or throw errors if the user manually sets both options, creating conflicts. Since the maximum line size is now adjusted based on the buffer size, I also had to increase a few buffer size tests that would otherwise break because they were slightly too small (e.g., not accounting for newline characters like \r\n).
