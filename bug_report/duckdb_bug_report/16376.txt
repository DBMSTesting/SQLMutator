Title: [SwiftRelease CI] fetch tags before checking there is already a tag with the same name
Description:
[SwiftRelease CI](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/13488488943/job/37682897743#step:8:19) fails when it tries to push with the tag name which is already exists.
The way how it checks that looks good, but maybe it should first fetch the tag names and check only then - this PR adds a line to fetch the tags.
