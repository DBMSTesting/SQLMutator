Title: Windows CI for the Julia Pkg errors with 'Could not load symbol "duckdb_vector_size"'
Description:
### What happens?

We have a failing Julia package build with DuckDB_jll 1.1.0 for Windows GitHub runners: https://github.com/TulipaEnergy/TulipaEnergyModel.jl/actions/runs/10833112611/job/30062514253

Revelant part reproduced:

```
ERROR: LoadError: could not load symbol "duckdb_vector_size":
The specified procedure could not be found. 
```

I saw other failures on 1.1.0, but I couldn't tell if they were related to this issue or not.

### To Reproduce

I created a simple repo building a Julia package that runs DuckDB here: https://github.com/abelsiqueira/DuckDBDebug.jl/actions/runs/10835456425/job/30067028887

You can see:
- It passes for ubuntu on DuckDB_jll 1.0.0 and 1.1.0
- It passes for Windows on DuckDB_jll 1.0.0
- It fails for Windows on DuckDB_jll 1.1.0

The code is very simple, and it doesn't actually run, since it fails on precompilation, but everything is included in the repo (https://github.com/abelsiqueira/DuckDBDebug.jl).
