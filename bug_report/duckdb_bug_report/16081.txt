Title: Import database 'my_directory' failing on database exported to parquet
Description:
### What happens?

I was attempting to move my 26gb DB from the 1.13 storage version to 1.2.
After exporting the 1.13 version in parquet format I attached to a blank persistent db in 1.2 storage format, then ran IMPORT DATABASE.
It failed part way through, I think on the largest file/table which may be larger than my memory (16gb) when unpacked the parquet file for that table was 2.6gb.
I've attached screenshots of the commands and the errors.

(By the way I was doing it this way because when i tried copy from db1 to db2 I got a primary key error, so I don't think the copy command respects the table order, I don't know whether this is something known or needs a separate issue raised for it? I've included a screenshot of that too)
