Title: duckdb_param_type returns DUCKDB_TYPE_INVALID for VARCHAR params (only)
Description:
### What happens?

The C API function `duckdb_param_type`, when called for a parameter of type VARCHAR, returns DUCKDB_TYPE_INVALID.

### To Reproduce

Here's a test case that fails:

```c
TEST_CASE("Test duckdb_param_type for VARCHAR", "[capi]") {
	duckdb_database db;
	duckdb_connection conn;
	duckdb_prepared_statement stmt;

	REQUIRE(duckdb_open("", &db) == DuckDBSuccess);
	REQUIRE(duckdb_connect(db, &conn) == DuckDBSuccess);
	REQUIRE(duckdb_prepare(conn, "select ?", &stmt) == DuckDBSuccess);

	REQUIRE(duckdb_bind_varchar(stmt, 1, "a") == DuckDBSuccess);

	REQUIRE(duckdb_param_type(stmt, 1) == DUCKDB_TYPE_VARCHAR);
}
```

It fails on the final REQUIRE with `0 == 17`.
