Title: Propagate collations through functions in a generic manner
Description:
Supersedes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12359

This PR adds a new property to functions - `FunctionCollationHandling`. This can be used to handle collations across different functions in an easy way. There are three settings:

* **PROPAGATE_COLLATIONS (default)**: Propagate collations, but do not apply them. This means that if the function returns `VARCHAR`, and any of the input arguments are `VARCHAR`, the return type will inherit the collations of the input arguments.
* **PUSH_COMBINABLE_COLLATIONS**: Propagates collations and applies **combinable** collations prior to calling the function. Combinable collations are "simple" collations like `nocase` and `noaccent`, but not `icu` collations that are more complex.
* **IGNORE_COLLATIONS**: Ignore collations entirely.

`PUSH_COMBINABLE_COLLATIONS` is used for various functions, e.g. `contains`, `starts_with`, `glob`, `like`, etc:

```sql
D SELECT 'hello' COLLATE NOCASE LIKE '%HEL%' AS result;
┌─────────┐
│ result  │
│ boolean │
├─────────┤
│ true    │
└─────────┘
```
