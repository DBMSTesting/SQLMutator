Title: Propagate schema in CreateIndexInfo
Description:
https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/commit/3b8ded3c7dd640f6d82e2a8fb79b6de9f24bcf92 fixes index creation to respect use schema commands. However, the schema information does not end up in `CreateIndexInfo`, where e.g. a rebind could find it.

This PR sets `create_index_info->schema` in `DuckCatalog::BindCreateIndex` according to the TableCatalogEntry it receives.
It also fixes the copy constructor of CreateIndexInfo to propagate the schema.
