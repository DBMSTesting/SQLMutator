Title: Unify entropy and mode aggregates - and skip specialized implementations for entropy with smaller binary
Description:
The `entropy` implementation is currently mostly a copy-paste of the `mode` function - in that it keeps a frequency map. This PR unifies it with the `mode` function, provides support for all types including nested types, and always uses the fallback implementation in case `SMALLER_BINARY` is triggered.
