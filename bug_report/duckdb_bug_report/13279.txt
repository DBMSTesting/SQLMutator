Title: Avoid clang-tidy-diff to check Python sources or extension folder
Description:
This should fix spurious errors like: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/10180824415/job/28159638617?pr=13202#step:7:98
```

/home/runner/work/duckdb/duckdb/tools/pythonpkg/src/pyrelation.cpp:1:10: error: 'duckdb_python/pybind11/pybind_wrapper.hpp' file not found [clang-diagnostic-error]
Error while processing /home/runner/work/duckdb/duckdb/tools/pythonpkg/src/pyrelation.cpp.

```

Note that clang-tidy already is NOT working in the tools/pythonpkg directory, I am not sure whether we want to bring that back that behaviour.

I have tested this by adding a narrowing double -> int implicit cast, that was not flagged in by `make tidy-check` and after this PR is not flagged also by `make tidy-check-diff`.

For now making so that behaviour is the same between checks on nightly and checks on PRs.
