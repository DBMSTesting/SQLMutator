Title: [Dev] Minor cleanup to BufferManager and BlockHandle API
Description:
- `BlockHandle::Load` and `BlockHandle::LoadFromBuffer` are no longer static. As a result `BlockHandle` now inherits from `enable_shared_from_this` to enable `shared_from_this()` [1].
- `BufferManager::Allocate` has lost the *out* parameter `shared_ptr<BlockHandle> *block`. Instead the `BlockHandle` is retrieved from the created `BufferHandle` with `GetBlockHandle()`

[1] This works because we *always* use `make_shared_ptr` when creating a `BlockHandle`, but perhaps we should formalize this and make the constructor private, creating a static method that returns a `shared_ptr` instead - so a BlockHandle can never be created without a `shared_ptr` backing it.
