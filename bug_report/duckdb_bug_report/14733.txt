Title: Support default values when appending data chunks
Description:
This PR implements the C++ side of appending data chunks with default values.

~~The driver/user/etc. can configure which column holds a default value. The motivation is that a few columns are typically filled with their respective default values during ingestion, similar to `INSERT INTO`.~~

~~If these columns change, the `Appender` automatically flushes all previous pending data and adjusts the default columns.~~

I changed the behavior to mimic that of `INSERT INTO`. If no active columns are provided, we assume the data chunk contains all columns. Once we provide active columns, all non-active columns default to their default values, or `NULL`.
