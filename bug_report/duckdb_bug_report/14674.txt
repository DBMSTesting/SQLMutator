Title: Allow a variable type `rowid` pseudocolumn in tables
Description:
This PR introduces support for configuring the `rowid` pseudo-column to use a type other than `BIGINT`. In particular, it enables `rowid` to be defined as either a `BLOB` or `VARCHAR`.  I think this is useful when working with external data sources, and especially Apache Arrow provided data sources.  This PR is one step on the road for enabling `DELETE`/`UPDATE`/`INSERT` to tables via Apache Arrow Flight but could be used by other data sources.

### Changes

To support this, I’ve updated the `TableCatalogEntry` to specify the type of `rowid` as a `LogicalType`, so this change can be used by other catalog implementations.

@pdet, In the Arrow integration, `ArrowTableFunction::ArrowToDuckDB` now accepts an optional `rowid_column_index` parameter to indicate the position of the `rowid` column within the Arrow table. This change ensures that `rowid` can appear at any position within an Arrow array.

To fully support this functionality, I also adjusted `BindContext::AddBaseTable`, and the `LogicalGet`, and `Binding` classes, ensuring that the `rowid` column type is dynamic but defaults to `LogicalTypeId::ROW_TYPE` if unspecified.

### Discussion

I realize this PR is a big bigger than the size I typically send, and will require more energy to review.  I tried to make it as small as possible, but if there is a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do I'm happy to rework the approach.  I’d also be happy to discuss any details or adjustments to make this approach work smoothly for others.  Thanks for reviewing this.
