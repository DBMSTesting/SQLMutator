Title: Feature #3036: Window Spooling
Description:
*  Add a Seek method for built on a new PrevScanIndex method to support random access to collections. The scans are linear for now, but that should be good enough for the current task.
* Plumb through everything needed to accumulate WindowDataChunk tuples in a ColumnDataCollection.
* Convert the value storage for the "value" window functions to use collections. Note that the validity masks for IGNORE NULLS and EXCLUDE are still memory resident, but they are a lot smaller.
* Create an explicit class for WindowAggregatorLocalState that can handle building and reading the argument collection in parallel instead of using a DataChunk and locks.
* Convert the na√Øve aggregator to use collections. 
* Convert the segment tree aggregator to use collections.
* Move all of the WindowDataChunk collection scanning functionality into a single class.
* Convert WindowDistinctAggregator to use paging collections.
* Create a wrapper for multi-threaded appending to WindowDataChunk objects.
* Move RANGE values to a collection.
* Convert the custom window functions to use collections instead of in-memory DataChunks.
* Track the insert data validity and pass it down to avoid checks.
* Pass down context so we can get real memory flushing sizes.
