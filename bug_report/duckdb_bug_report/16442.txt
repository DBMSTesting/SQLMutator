Title: Bump delta to working commit
Description:
Example of build problems:
- v1.2-histrionicus: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/13556221109
- main: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/actions/runs/13556221101

This is against `v1.2-histrionicus` branch, so that it can then later merged in `main` while keeping the config aligned.
