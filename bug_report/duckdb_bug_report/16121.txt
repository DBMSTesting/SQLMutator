Title: Use aws s3api put-object to avoid override
Description:
This changes (for the better?) two different things:
* extensions stored on S3 are not publicly reachable (since I believe that's handled via CDN)
* `aws s3api put-object --if-none-match '*'` is used instead of `aws s3 cp`, that will override objects

This is clearly untested, but strategy to check this is working as intended would be, for the first part just merging and checking if nightly extensions are reachable via the extension endpoint (and if not changing CDN settings), and for the second part:
* merge this in main
* trigger InvokeCI this twice with the same commit, checking what happens
* first run is expected to be successful
* second run is expected to be also successful, but don't upload any artifact (this can be checked with timestamps AND looking at the logs)
