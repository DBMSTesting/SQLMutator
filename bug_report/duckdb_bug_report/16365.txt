Title: Unable to install Postgres Extension DuckDB 1.2 Java driver
Description:
### What happens?

I am using a AWS graviton instance and using DuckDB 1.2 with **java driver**.
When I try to load the postgres scanner extension, I get the following error
```
root=> install postgres;
ERROR:  HTTP Error: Failed to download extension "postgres_scanner" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.2.0/linux_arm64_gcc4/postgres_scanner.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 403)
Extension "postgres_scanner" is an existing extension.

For more info, visit https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/troubleshooting/?version=v1.2.0&platform=linux_arm64_gcc4&extension=postgres_scanner
DETAIL:  java.sql.SQLException: HTTP Error: Failed to download extension "postgres_scanner" at URL "http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.2.0/linux_arm64_gcc4/postgres_scanner.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 403)
Extension "postgres_scanner" is an existing extension.
```

- This happens only with DuckDB 1.2 with **java driver**.
- DuckDB 1.1.3 with java driver works fine
- DuckDB 1.1.3 and 1.2 CLI works fine

When I digged deaper, DuckDB java 1.1.3 is identifying the platform as `linux_arm64` but DuckDB java 1.2 is identifying the platform as `linux_arm64_gcc4` (on the same EC2 instance) which is the problem.
