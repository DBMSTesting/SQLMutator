Title: Implement Union By Name on read csv relation
Description:
t is important to note that the sniffer will be re-executed during the actual read, as it is necessary to determine the unique schema file.

One option for the future is to cache the file schemas and dialects. However, this is currently challenging because the information is passed to the binder through named parameters. But maybe it is still worth considering a way of passing per-file cached options especially if other table relations undergo a similar process.
