Title: Create or Replace Temporary Type x as Enum not supported
Description:
### What happens?

Temporary types / temporary enums don't appear to be supported just yet. 

I found a use case for this when creating an enum type to use as the columns to pivot outwards in a dynamic PIVOT (using the `query` table function). Since `query` can only execute a single statement, I need to create the enum ahead of time. Without a temporary type, I need to do a fair bit of bookkeeping to ensure transactional safety. The syntax I end up having to use is:
```sql
BEGIN;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS columns_parameter_enum;
CREATE TYPE columns_parameter_enum AS ENUM (FROM build_my_enum('my_table_with_nulls', ['col2'] , []));

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE my_results AS 
    FROM dynamic_aggregates('my_table_with_nulls', ['col1', 'col3', 'col4'], ['count(col1)'], ['col2'], [], subtotals:=1, grand_totals:=1);
DROP TYPE columns_parameter_enum;
COMMIT;

FROM my_results;
```

My ideal syntax would be:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TYPE columns_parameter_enum AS ENUM (FROM build_my_enum('my_table_with_nulls', ['col2'] , []));

FROM dynamic_aggregates('my_table_with_nulls', ['col1', 'col3', 'col4'], ['count(col1)'], ['col2'], [], subtotals:=1, grand_totals:=1);
```

(Note the `dynamic_aggregates` function uses the `query` table function together with a `pivot` and refers to the `columns_parameter_enum`)

### To Reproduce

These do not work just yet:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TYPE my_enum AS ENUM (SELECT 42 UNION ALL SELECT 43);
```

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE my_enum AS ENUM (SELECT 42 UNION ALL SELECT 43);
```

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TYPE my_enum AS ENUM (SELECT 42 UNION ALL SELECT 43);
```

All of the above return the same message:
```
Parser Error: syntax error at or near "TYPE"
```

This works:
```sql
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS my_enum;
CREATE TYPE my_enum AS ENUM (SELECT 42 UNION ALL SELECT 43);
```
