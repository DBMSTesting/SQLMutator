Title: array_agg with ORDER BY does not respect default_collation
Description:
### What happens?

When using the array_agg function with an ORDER BY clause, it appears that the default_collation setting is not being respected. This leads to unexpected sorting behavior, particularly with mixed-case strings.

### To Reproduce

```sql
set default_collation = EN_US;
WITH values AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array('0,2,a,A,b,c,d,D,f,h,p,P,r,R,x,z', ',')) AS value
)
SELECT array_to_string(array_agg(value ORDER BY value ASC), ',') AS c FROM values;
```
Expected Result
The result should be sorted case-insensitively, similar to a regular ORDER BY clause:
```
0,2,a,A,b,c,d,D,f,h,p,P,r,R,x,z
```
Actual Result
The result is sorted with uppercase letters appearing before lowercase letters:
```
0,2,A,D,P,R,a,b,c,d,f,h,p,r,x,z
```
**Additional Context

When using a simple ORDER BY clause outside of array_agg, the collation is respected:

```sql
WITH values AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array('0,2,a,A,b,c,d,D,f,h,p,P,r,R,x,z', ',')) AS value
)
SELECT * FROM values ORDER BY value;
```
This produces the expected case-insensitive sort order.

PostgreSQL produces the expected result with the same query (postgres has `en_US.UTF-8` collation):

```sql
WITH values AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array('0,2,a,A,b,c,d,D,f,h,p,P,r,R,x,z', ',')) AS value
)
SELECT array_to_string(array_agg(value ORDER BY value ASC), ',') AS c FROM values;
```
Result:
```
0,2,a,A,b,c,d,D,f,h,p,P,r,R,x,z
```
