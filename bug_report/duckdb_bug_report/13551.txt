Title: Remove patches (vss and substrait), bump other repositories
Description:
After this is in, those are the extensions that will be missing / will need to be looked at:
 - [ ]: postgres (https://github.com/duckdb/postgres_scanner/pull/247 + bump / remove patches)
 - [ ]: spatial (remove patches + bump)
 - [ ]: azure (remove patches + bump)
 - [ ]: delta (bump?)
 - [ ]: possibly ug_catalog ?
 - [ ]: extension-template ?

The other will have no patches and all aligned to respective main branch.

This includes a commit from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13112, that can then be closed.
