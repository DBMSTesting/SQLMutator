Title: Extend least/greatest to support all types, and always return the same type as its input types
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/11606

This PR reworks the `least/greatest` functions so that they support all types, instead of the currently (limited) set of types. As seen in the given issue, implicit casting can lead to incorrect results for certain types for these functions. After this rework we maintain the original types. We try to combine types if they are different according to our implicit cast rules, or throw an error if this is not possible. Sort keys are used for types that are not natively supported.

After this PR `least/greatest` can be used for all types, similar to how we can use min/max or comparison operations for all types, e.g.:

```sql
D select least([1], [2]) as result;
┌─────────┐
│ result  │
│ int32[] │
├─────────┤
│ [1]     │
└─────────┘
```
