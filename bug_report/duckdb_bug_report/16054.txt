Title: Benchmark runner: catch and log errors + add support for `retry load N` syntax
Description:
Instead of terminating with an uncaught exception the benchmark runner now logs that there was an error.

In addition, we add a new syntax `retry load N` which can be used to retry the load phase up to `N` times in case of errors. We use this in the h2oai benchmark (which downloads CSV files from a remote source and sporadically runs into failures on our CI).
