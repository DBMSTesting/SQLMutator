Title: Feature #12699: ROW_NUMBER Secondary Sorts
Description:
* Fix MergeSortTree::AggregateLowerBound to compare values properly. This would allow us to use sort keys as level elements, but is not currently leveraged
* Use a unique WindowTokenTree to implement secondary sorting for ROW_NUMBER window functions
* Make WindowNtileExecutor a subclass WindowRowNumberExecutor, not WindowValueExecutor.
* Don't add the NTILE argument to the collection (it is just per-row)
* Compute the NTILE row number from the sort, if requested.
