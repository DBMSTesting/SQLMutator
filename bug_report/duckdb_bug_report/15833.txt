Title: json_structure() doesn't parse date, time, timestamp, or uuid types
Description:
### What happens?

I'm using `json_structure()` to understand my JSON data before casting to a STRUCT. All my timestamp columns are coming back as VARCHAR.

To debug, I tried looking at other string-like data types (at least in how they're represented in JSON). It seems all of them are read as strings.

### To Reproduce

```
-- Setup
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW examples AS
SELECT 
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS timestamp, 
    CURRENT_TIME AS time,
    CURRENT_DATE AS date,
    UUID() AS uuid;

-- All VARCHAR
SELECT
    examples::json AS table_as_json,
    json_structure(table_as_json) AS json_stucture,
FROM examples;

-- Reading from a JSON file fixes time, date, and uuid
-- timestamp still not parsed
COPY examples to 'examples.json';

DESCRIBE FROM 'examples.json';
```

| table_as_json                                                                                                                                      | json_stucture                                                                              |
