Title: Wrapping DISTINCT with UNNEST eliminates DISTINCT's effect
Description:
### What happens?

For demonstration, consider the following table:

`select * from sample;`
| name | value | description |
|------|------:|-------------|
| a    | 1     | d1          |
| b    | 2     | d2          |
| b    | 2     | d3          |
| c    | 4     | d4          |
| c    | 4     | d5          |

With the following query I can get distinct name and value combinations:

`SELECT DISTINCT("name", "value") FROM sample;`
| main.row("name", "value") |
|---------------------------|
| (a, 1)                    |
| (c, 4)                    |
| (b, 2)                    |

The result has 1 column which is of struct type. When I try to unnest this struct, results are not distinct any more:

`SELECT UNNEST(DISTINCT("name", "value")) FROM sample;`
| element1 | element2 |
|----------|---------:|
| a        | 1        |
| b        | 2        |
| b        | 2        |
| c        | 4        |
| c        | 4        |

Basically I would expect distinct `name` and `value` for this query:

`SELECT TODAY() AS create_date, UNNEST(DISTINCT("name", "value")) FROM sample;`
| create_date | element1 | element2 |
|-------------|----------|---------:|
| 2024-07-19  | a        | 1        |
| 2024-07-19  | b        | 2        |
| 2024-07-19  | b        | 2        |
| 2024-07-19  | c        | 4        |
| 2024-07-19  | c        | 4        |

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample(name STRING, value INT, description STRING);

INSERT INTO sample VALUES ('a', 1, 'd1'), ('b', 2, 'd2'), ('b', 2, 'd3'), ('c', 4, 'd4'), ('c', 4, 'd5');

-- below query returns distinct rows
SELECT DISTINCT("name", "value") FROM sample;

-- below query returns not distinct rows
SELECT UNNEST(DISTINCT("name", "value")) FROM sample;

-- below query also returns not distinct rows
SELECT TODAY() AS create_date, UNNEST(DISTINCT("name", "value")) FROM sample;
```
