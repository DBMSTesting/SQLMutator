Title: Rework Wasm extensions CI, and use out_of_tree_extensions.cmake
Description:
Thanks to work in the bump to [recent spatial](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/15158) and other work that went in CI recently, this should make trivial to keep in sink extensions for DuckDB-Wasm and other platforms.

Note that this DO NOT yet uploads or sign extensions, but that's an independent step that can be done in a follow up.
