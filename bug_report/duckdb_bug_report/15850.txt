Title: Nightly Linux AMD64 (x86_64) CLI client link stuck in November 2024
Description:
Requesting https://artifacts.duckdb.org/latest/duckdb-binaries-linux.zip (as linked on the [download page](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=main&environment=cli&platform=linux&download_method=direct&architecture=x86_64)) returns a binary where `./duckdb --version` returns `v1.1.4-dev2261 ed90e384ef`; [`ed90e384ef`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/ed90e384ef) is from November 25, 2024, and there have been quite a few changes (including a bugfix I would like to try) since then.
