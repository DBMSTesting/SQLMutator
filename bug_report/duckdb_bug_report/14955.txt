Title: Adding an index returns inconsistent results
Description:
### What happens?

My table has a `cluster_id` field which multiple rows share. This table was originally generated using the rust bindings but I use the CLI for queries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM clusters LIMIT 1;
```

returns one row with `event_cluster_id = 1`. But when I run

```sql
SELECT * FROM clusters WHERE event_cluster_id = 1;
```

I get 0 rows.

Dropping the index on cluster_id fixes the issue. Is there any reason why adding an index produces inconsistent results?

I can't attach the db file because it is too large (500M rows).
