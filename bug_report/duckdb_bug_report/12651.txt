Title: PIVOT should have syntax to GROUP BY no columns
Description:
### What happens?

You want to PIVOT your data but only have one row of output with data in columns. There's no syntax to indicate that any extra fields should be ignored. The default behavior of PIVOT is to group by all other fields (GROUP BY ALL). The PIVOT case needs something like GROUP BY NONE or just an empty GROUP BY.

### To Reproduce

```sql
CREATE TABLE Cities (
    Country VARCHAR, Name VARCHAR, Year INTEGER, Population INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('NL', 'Amsterdam', 2000, 1005);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('NL', 'Amsterdam', 2010, 1065);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('NL', 'Amsterdam', 2020, 1158);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('US', 'Seattle', 2000, 564);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('US', 'Seattle', 2010, 608);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('US', 'Seattle', 2020, 738);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('US', 'New York City', 2000, 8015);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('US', 'New York City', 2010, 8175);
INSERT INTO Cities VALUES ('US', 'New York City', 2020, 8772);

PIVOT Cities
ON Year
USING sum(Population);
-- This groups by Country and Name

-- I would like to just get one row with a column for each year.
-- The shortest workaround I know of is
with step1 as (select sum(Population) as Population from Cities group by Year),
pivot step1 on Year using sum(Population);
```
