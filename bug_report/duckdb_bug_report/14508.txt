Title: Swift - casting to date not working as expected
Description:
### What happens?

The expectation of the following code should result in a date, as it is in the CSV, which is mm/dd/yyyy.  Instead, it shows as Date(days: 19970)

'''
   case .date:
    TabularData.Column(self.cast(to: Date.self)).eraseToAnyColumn()
'''

The cast is not working - how do you fix this ?
