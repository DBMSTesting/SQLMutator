Title: CREATE TABLE now supports columns with `ENUM[]` types.
Description:
This PR fixes #14099 

I also noticed that `catalog.schema.user_type` and `schema.user_type` don't support this, and attempted to fix this here directly, but the issue appears to be at the parser level so for now I've just added a test so we're aware of this limitation.

I created another method to deal with all of the base_type logic, letting the arrayBounds be processed in the outer layer, removing a bunch of if/else chains and cleaning up the code because of that.
