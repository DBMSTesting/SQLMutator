Title: C API - Cannot get named parameter type
Description:
### What happens?

When using [named parameters](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/prepared_statements.html#named-parameters-parameter), `duckdb_param_type` always returns `Invalid`. Works fine for other types of parameters.


### To Reproduce


```c
state = duckdb_open(NULL, &db);
state = duckdb_connect(db, &connection);

state = duckdb_prepare(connection, "CREATE TABLE person (name VARCHAR, age BIGINT);", &preparedStatement);
state = duckdb_execute_prepared(preparedStatement, &result);

state = duckdb_prepare(connection, "INSERT INTO person VALUES ('Alice', 37), ('Ana', 35), ('Bob', 41), ('Bea', 25);", &preparedStatement);
state = duckdb_execute_prepared(preparedStatement, &result);

state = duckdb_prepare(connection, "Select * from person where age=$age;", &preparedStatement);

//paramType is Invalid. Works fine if I use positional or auto-incremented parameters.
auto paramType = duckdb_param_type(preparedStatement, 1);
```
