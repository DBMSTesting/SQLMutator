Title: Fix issue #16377
Description:
There were a few faulty test cases for the `USING KEY` variant of `WITH RECURSIVE`. TL;DR, the test cases generated more than one value for a key in one iteration, without taking the order into account. This resulted in a race condition when parallelism was applied.
