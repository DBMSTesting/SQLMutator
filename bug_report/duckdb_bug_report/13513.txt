Title: Estimated Cardinality value should stay consistent during optimization process
Description:
fixes https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb-internal/issues/2723

Cardinality Estimation happens in Join Order Optimization. We would like to keep these estimated cardinalities consistent as the optimization process runs. Sometimes, however, during statistics propagation, new filters are introduced and inner joins are replaced with cross products, which are then converted back into inner joins. When these new operators are created, we loose the estimated cardinality that was defined during the join order optimization process. This PR should fix that. 

It also adds some code to print the estimated cardinality of an operator when you print the logical plan when debugging.
