Title: [Dev] Fix alignment issue in Roaring compression method
Description:
This PR fixes a bug found internally

Since we're dealing with either `uint16_t` or `uint8_t` in the container data, we could get into the situation where our pointer is aligned to `uint8_t` and the next container to write wants to store `uint16_t` - we need to align this.
