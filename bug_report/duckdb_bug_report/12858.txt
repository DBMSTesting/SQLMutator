Title: [Fix] Mixing block sizes and compression functions
Description:
Fixes a situation where we load `{bit packing + type}` into the available global compression functions and later try to use it for smaller block sizes. We did not perform the `supports_type` check for already-loaded functions.

Additionally, this PR contains the remaining feedback from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/12691.
