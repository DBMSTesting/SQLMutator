Title: unable to parameterize call to DESCRIBE
Description:
### What happens?

One way to collect the column names of a table, t, into a list is:
```sql
select array_agg(column_name) from (describe t);
```
But it is currently not possible to abstract this into a DuckDB MACRO:
```sql
create macro cols(myt) as (select array_agg(column_name) from (describe myt));
```
```console
Catalog Error: Table with name myt does not exist!
```
There's a similar problem with attempting to abstract the following into a MACRO:
```sql
create macro cols(t) as (select json_keys(j) from (select t::json j from t));
```
Is this a bug?  If not, how could cols(myt) be defined as a MACRO that
does not depend on the JSON extension?


### To Reproduce

Assuming myt is not already a table:

```
create or replace macro cols(myt) as (select array_agg(column_name) from (describe myt));
```
