Title: Unexpected result after creating index on varchar column
Description:
### What happens?

Consider the following test case. The third query is unexpected as it falsely returns an empty table. The second query shows that the expression `t0.c0<='a'` is true for all the rows and thus the third query should return `'a', 'a'`. 

I could reproduce it on both nightly build v1.0.1-dev5272 4d18b9d05c and source build v1.0.1-dev5276 0e6dacd893. Things go well on stable release v1.0.0 1f98600c2c.

### To Reproduce

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0;

CREATE  TABLE  t0(c0 VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('a');
CREATE INDEX t0i0 ON t0(c0 );
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES ('a');

SELECT * FROM t0; -- 'a', 'a'
SELECT ((t0.c0)<=('a')) FROM t0; -- true, true
SELECT * FROM t0 WHERE ((t0.c0)<=('a'));
-- Expected: 'a', 'a'
-- Actual: empty table
```
