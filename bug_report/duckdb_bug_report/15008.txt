Title: for-loop-erase bugfix in filter pushdown
Description:
doing myvector.erase_at(idx) inside a for(auto idx=0; idx < myvector.size(); i++) would make you skip the element after the erased one, because STL compacts the vector

this bug results in less predicates getting pushed down than possible
