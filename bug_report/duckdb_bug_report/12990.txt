Title: Add work-around for R client table function initialization back in under a config setting
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/12947

The join-filter pushdown needs the source initialization to be postponed so that we have the dynamically pushed down filters available when the probe is initialized. This conflicts with a work-around we need for the R client where we need to initialize all scans in the main thread as R's stack-depth detection algorithm does not deal well with multi-threading. In order to reconcile this we add a flag `initialize_in_main_thread` that can be set in the R client.

Note that setting this flag effectively disables dynamic join filter pushdown.
