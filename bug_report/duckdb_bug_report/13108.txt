Title: Fixes for RegexFindAll function errors and multibyte character support
Description:
This PR addresses two issues with the `RegexFindAll` function:
1. Corrected out-of-range position errors and potential segfaults when the entry string had more than two matches. That was because of the `position += ...` in the code.
2. Fixed infinite loops when the function gets empty string delimiters.

Additionally, the function now supports multibyte characters.

**Note**: These issues had not caused failures previously because this specific functionality hadnâ€™t been used in these cases so far. However, they may arise when `RegexFindAll` is used in the `string_split` function.
