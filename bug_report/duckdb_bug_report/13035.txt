Title: Fixes for LogicalType::ANY and fixed_size_map
Description:
* `LogicalType::ANY` in the C API currently relies on catching an `InternalException` to deal with invalid types in various places. This does not work with `CRASH_ON_ASSERT` (which breaks my local workflow) - and we shouldn't be throwing internal exceptions ever anyway. This PR fixes it so we detect invalid types up-front instead.
* Adds a static cast to the `fixed_size_map` as this causes warnings on some CI runs otherwise
