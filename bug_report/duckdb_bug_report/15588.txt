Title: InternalException should only invalidate database when encountered during execution
Description:
Internal exceptions signal failures of internal assertions in DuckDB - as such we force the database to be shut down, as they might leave DuckDB in an unknown state.

Most of the internal exceptions we encounter, however, happen during the bind/optimization phases - and these do not have any danger of leaving the database in an unknown state. This PR makes it so that only internal exceptions encountered during the execution or commit/rollback phases invalidate the database.
