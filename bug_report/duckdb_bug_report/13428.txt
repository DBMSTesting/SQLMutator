Title: I deleted SEQUENCE from default value of the table but i can't CREATE OR REPLACE SEQUENCE
Description:
### What happens?

Hi,

I have created a sequence and used it as the default value of a column in a table. I want to manually add data to the relevant column in this table and then set the start value of the sequence.

The error message: Dependency Error: Cannot drop entry "seq_personid" because there are entries that depend on it.
table "Persons" depends on index "seq_personid".
Use DROP...CASCADE to drop all dependents.

I added the sql.

### To Reproduce

```
CREATE SEQUENCE if not exists seq_personid START 1;

CREATE TABLE if not exists Persons (
    id integer default nextval('seq_personid'),
    name varchar(255) not null
);

insert into Persons (name) values('a001');
insert into Persons (id, name) values(2, 'a002');

ALTER TABLE Persons ALTER COLUMN id SET default 0;

CREATE or REPLACE SEQUENCE seq_personid START 3;
--Dependency Error: Cannot drop entry "seq_personid" because there are entries that depend on it.
--table "Persons" depends on index "seq_personid".
--Use DROP...CASCADE to drop all dependents.

ALTER TABLE Persons ALTER COLUMN id SET default nextval('seq_personid');

insert into Persons (name) values('a003');
insert into Persons (name) values('a004');

select * from persons;
```
