Title: duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Failed to create directory "/root/.duckdb/": Read-only file sy
Description:
### What happens?

When I try to execute `connection.sql(query=query, params=params)` inside my deployed docker container I get

`duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Failed to create directory "/root/.duckdb/": Read-only file system`.

The problem is that my filesystem is readonly for security reasons. I'm not allowed to deploy if its not readonly.

The writeable place I can use is `/tmp`. I also have a netapp fileshare which is writeable at `/home/jovyan/fshared`. I tried looking in the documentation - but I cannot see it described anywhere how I can change this.


### To Reproduce

Deploy in docker with readonly filesystem. Run `connection.sql(query, params)`.
