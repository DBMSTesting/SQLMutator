Title: Add `struct_concat`
Description:
This PR adds a new `struct_concat` function to merge multiple structs horizontally.
Concatenating structs with duplicate keys results in an error. Concatenating unnamed structs is supported, but you cannot mix named and unnamed.

A future cool improvement to consider when there are structs containing keys of the same name would be to merge their entries into a new list of the type of the duplicate key (or max logical type). The resulting new member could even be a ARRAY as the number of duplicates would be known at bind time.
