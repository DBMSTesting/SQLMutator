Title: Fix pessimizing move issue in collate_expression's copy.
Description:
Such seemingly helpful moves are harmful since they make returned value ineligible for copy elision.  More context is in https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231124-00/?p=109059

There are lots of other places where the same issue happens in the codebase and I'd recommend using tools like clang-tidy to fix all of them.
