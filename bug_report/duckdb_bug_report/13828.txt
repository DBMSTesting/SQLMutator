Title: Incorrect cast from varchar to int8
Description:
### What happens?

Expecting EXPLAIN to show casting of `'i8'::int8` to `TINYINT` to be consistent with other shorthand casts.



### To Reproduce

```
duckdb> EXPLAIN SELECT 'i8'::int8,'i16'::int16,'i32'::int32, 'i64'::int64, 'u8'::uint8, 'u16'::uint16, 'u32'::uint32, 'u64'::uint64;
┌───────────────────────────┐
│         PROJECTION        │
│   ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─   │
│    CAST('i8' AS BIGINT)   │
│  CAST('i16' AS SMALLINT)  │
│   CAST('i32' AS INTEGER)  │
│   CAST('i64' AS BIGINT)   │
│   CAST('u8' AS UTINYINT)  │
│  CAST('u16' AS USMALLINT) │
│  CAST('u32' AS UINTEGER)  │
│   CAST('u64' AS UBIGINT)  │
└─────────────┬─────────────┘
