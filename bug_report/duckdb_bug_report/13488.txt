Title: Apply extension patches via 'patch' instead of 'git apply'
Description:
Idea is that even when submodules are not being fetched from git (say folder populated independently), this should work the same.

duckdb-wasm already moved to using patch unix command, CI here should only test that current workflows are not impacted.
