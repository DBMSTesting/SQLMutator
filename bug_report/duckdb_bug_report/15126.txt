Title: Skip building azure extension due to problems installing libxml
Description:
Solution might be overriding libxml's vcpkg config, to be experimented on extension side.

Note this means `azure` will not be built on regular CI, and needs to be handled separately.

Tradeoff I think it's still OK, given most CI, also on forks or PRs is failing mid-vcpkg due to problems fetching from the `gnome.gitlab.com` endpoint that appears to be under water and returning 503.
