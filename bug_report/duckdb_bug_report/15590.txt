Title: Annotate errors in table macros with the call position of the table macro
Description:
This now correctly points at the call of the table macro as the source of the error, instead of a location within the table macro (which does not make sense in the query that is actually being run).

Example:
```sql
D create macro count_tbl(x) as table SELECT COUNT(*) FROM query_table(table_name);
D select * from count_tbl('tbl');
```
```
Catalog Error:
Table with name table_name does not exist!
Did you mean "pg_tablespace"?

LINE 1: select * from count_tbl('tbl');
                      ^

```
