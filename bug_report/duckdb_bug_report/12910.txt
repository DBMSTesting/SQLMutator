Title: [C-API] `duckdb_data_chunk_reset` should mention stale pointers
Description:
### What happens?

Calling `duckdb_data_chunk_reset` could turn these into dangling pointers:
- `duckdb_vector_get_validity`
- `duckdb_vector_get_data`

After calling `duckdb_data_chunk_reset` these methods should be called again and the results from calls before `duckdb_data_chunk_reset` should be considered stale and outdated.

The inline docs in the `duckdb.h` header should mention this.
