Title: "out of range" error when reading parquet with unsigned tinyint or unsigned smallint
Description:
### What happens?

"out of range" error when reading parquet with unsigned tinyint (unsigned int8) or unsigned smallint (unsigned int16).  

Error message for tinyint:
```
Invalid Input Error: Failed to cast value: Type UINT32 with value 4294967295 can't be cast because the value is out of range for the destination type UINT8
```

Error message for smallint:
```
Invalid Input Error: Failed to cast value: Type UINT32 with value 4294967295 can't be cast because the value is out of range for the destination type UINT16
```

### To Reproduce

Create a **parquet** file **containing at least 1 row** with this **schema**:
```
message schema {
  OPTIONAL INT32 hcol0 (INTEGER(8,false));
}
```
or
```
message schema {
  OPTIONAL INT32 hcol0 (INTEGER(16,false));
}
```

Use Duckdb to query the parquet:
```sql
select hcol0 from READ_PARQUET('data.parquet');
```

Example parquet files (the extension is put as `.txt` to be able to upload here)
[utinyint.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18060837/utinyint.txt)
[usmallint.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18060836/usmallint.txt)

```sql
select hcol0 from read_parquet('utinyint.txt');
select hcol0 from read_parquet('usmallint.txt');
```
