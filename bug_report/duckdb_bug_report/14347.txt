Title: [PySpark] Add withColumns, withColumnsRenamed, cos, acos, any_value, approx_count_distinct and various array functions
Description:
One commit per function to make it easier to review:
- DataFrame.withColumns
- DataFrame.withColumnsRenamed
- cos
- acos
- any_value
- approx_count_distinct
- array_distinct
- array_intersect
- array_union
- array_min
- array_max

Happy to further build out the API in subsequent PRs if there is interest! It would be super handy if we can get it to a higher coverage.
