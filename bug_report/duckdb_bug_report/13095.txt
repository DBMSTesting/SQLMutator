Title: Add support for ZSTD compressed JSON files
Description:
This PR adds support for reading ZSTD JSON files via the JSON extension.

I re-used the `ZstdFileSystem` class implemented in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/2697 to avoid code duplication.

There is one thing I'm not sure about and it's the fact that `ZstdFileSystem` supports writes. I don't know what will be the effect on the JSON extension.
