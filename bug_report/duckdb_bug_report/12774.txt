Title: `duckdb.connect()` with Python API should accept `Path` objects
Description:
### What happens?

With the Python API, `Path` instances are not accepted as file paths. 

### To Reproduce

```python
>>> import duckdb
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> c1 = duckdb.connect('/tmp/test1.db')
>>> c2 = duckdb.connect(Path('/tmp/test2.db'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: connect(): incompatible function arguments. The following argument types are supported:
    1. (database: str = ':memory:', read_only: bool = False, config: dict = None) -> duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection

Invoked with: PosixPath('/tmp/test2.db')
```
