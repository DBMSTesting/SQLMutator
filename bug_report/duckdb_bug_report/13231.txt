Title: [DEV] CSV Tests Refactor and Sniffer decoupled of the vector size
Description:
This PR improves CSV Testing by:
* Unifying path where CSV files used in our tests are located. Now they are all in ('data/csv').
* Tests were revisited to add `PRAGMA enable_verification` where possible.
* All tests should now pass regardless of `vector_size`; hence, this requirement was removed. The sniffer is now independent of the vector size.
* Some tests were abandoned, these were cleaned up and readded.
