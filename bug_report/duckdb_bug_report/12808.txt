Title: [Fix] Improve performance of ART leaf operations
Description:
Fixes https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/7565.

This PR contains changes to improve ART leaf performance.
- [x] Append row IDs to the head of a leaf chain instead of the tail.
- [x] Merge leaf chains directly without copying row IDs.
- [ ] Move non-full leaves to the front during `remove`.
- [ ] Attempt low-effort defragmentation during `remove` by merging two adjacent leaf nodes, if possible.
- [ ] Remove memory safety checks from performance-critical code paths.
- [ ] Potentially remove the hash lookup of fixed-size buffers.
