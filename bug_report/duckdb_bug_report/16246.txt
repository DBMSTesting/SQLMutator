Title: Arena allocator for `MinMaxN` and skip `NULL`s when creating enum
Description:
Instead of allocating a `std::vector` per group, we now use arena allocations to allocate fixed-size arrays. This greatly reduces contention on the system allocator when there are many threads/groups. It also fixes the scaling issues encountered here: https://duckdb.org/2024/10/25/topn.html

I also removed an error thrown when a `NULL` was encountered when creating an `ENUM`. This was unnecessary, as we could just skip.
