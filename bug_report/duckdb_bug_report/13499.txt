Title: Add support for registering custom casts (and types) through c api
Description:
This PR is a follow-up that contains #13490 but also adds new functions for registering custom cast functions. 

These work similarly to scalar functions and provide similar capabilities to set e.g. custom user data. But compared to implementing cast functions in C++, the c-api also provides the possibility to detect whether or not the cast is executed within a TRY_CAST. Additionally it won't throw an exception in a non-try cast as soon as you set the error message (as would be the case if you used c++'s `HandleCastError` util). This allow c-based cast functions to be able to clean up any temporary resources when an invalid cast input is encountered during a non-try cast, while also being able to explicitly short-circuit execution by simply returning false when they are ready after setting the error message.
