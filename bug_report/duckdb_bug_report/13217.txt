Title: Query with hive partitioning much slower than hardcoded path
Description:
### What happens?

I'm running the following 2 queries which do exactly the same thing on an azure ADLS Gen2 Premium. each day folder has one file of approximately 200-300MB
Based on the results it seems that one with hive partitioning is much more slower. Is this normal behavior? I thought hive partitioning provides better execution times.

### To Reproduce

 Querying the parquet files with hive partitioning enabled approximately 23s to return
````
SELECT
    AVG(Profit),
    "Country",
    strftime(to_timestamp(Timestamp / 1000), '%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00') as Hour
FROM
    read_parquet('az://mycontainer.blob.core.windows.net/orders-hive-date/*/*/*/*.parquet', hive_partitioning = true)
WHERE
    year = 2023
    AND month = 01
    AND day = 01
GROUP BY
    "Country",
    strftime(to_timestamp(Timestamp / 1000), '%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00')
ORDER BY
    Hour;    
````

Querying the parquet files with hardcoding values takes approximately 3s
```
SELECT
    AVG(Profit),
    "Country",
    strftime(to_timestamp(Timestamp / 1000), '%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00') as Hour
FROM
    read_parquet('az://mycontainer.blob.core.windows.net/orders-hive-date/year=2023/month=01/day=01/*.parquet')
GROUP BY
    "Country",
    strftime(to_timestamp(Timestamp / 1000), '%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00')
ORDER BY
    Hour;
