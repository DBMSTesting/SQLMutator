Title: Switch floating point division and modulo to use IEEE semantics for division by zero by default, and add ieee_floating_point_ops setting that can be used to revert back to old behavior
Description:
Implements https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/10956

This PR changes the behavior of floating point division/modulo by zero to by default follow IEEE-754 semantics, i.e. the following results are returned:

|   expr   | result |
|----------|-------:|
| 1.0 / 0  | inf    |
| 1.0 / -0  | -inf   |
| -1.0 / 0 | -inf   |
| -1.0 / -0 | inf    |
| 0.0 / 0  | nan    |
| 0.0 / -0  | nan    |
| nan / -0  | nan    |
| nan / 0  | nan    |
| inf / 0  | inf    |
| inf / -0  | -inf   |

Previously all of these would return `NULL`.

The `ieee_floating_point_ops`  setting is added which can be used to return to the previous behavior, by setting this to `false`.

```sql
SET ieee_floating_point_ops=false;
```

e.g.:

```sql
D select 1.0 / 0.0 AS result;
┌────────┐
│ result │
│ double │
├────────┤
│    inf │
└────────┘
D SET ieee_floating_point_ops=false;
D select 1.0 / 0.0 AS result;
┌────────┐
│ result │
│ double │
├────────┤
│   NULL │
└────────┘

```
