Title: feat: refactor getting tie_break_offset in SelectBestMatch
Description:
We have a case where we need access to the tie break offset of different secret storages when we do `LookupSecrets` in one secret storage (the one on the server side). This refactor adds "tie break offset" of a secret storage to the parameter list of `SelectBestMatch` method so that this function can be more flexibly used without needing to rely on the class it belongs to (GetTiebreakOffset()). As a result, I'm also changing this function to `static` (still `protected`) in SecretStorage to make it clear that it's not tied to any class instance and adding `tie_break_offset` to be a const parameter when instantiating a SecretStorage class to ensure that this value doesn't get modified after initialization.
