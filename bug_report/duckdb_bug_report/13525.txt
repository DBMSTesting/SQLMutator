Title: Regression: query that runs instantly on GA release hangs indefinitely on the last few nightlies
Description:
### What happens?

A query of moderate complexity and based on small-ish datasets hangs indefinitely on the past few nighty builds. The same query finishes correctly instantly on the GA release.

### To Reproduce

```sql
  select      row_number() over ()
  ,           count(distinct upper_ch1_ch2) over()::int  as num_bigrams
  ,           sum(count_ch1_ch2) over ()            as bigram_count_all
  ,           count_ch1_ch2 / bigram_count_all         as actual_bigram_frequency
  ,           ch1.actual_frequency * ch2.actual_frequency as expected_bigram_frequency
  from        read_csv('stat_bigrams.csv')    as stat_bigrams
  inner join  read_csv('stat_stat_chars.csv') as ch1
  on          stat_bigrams.ascii_upper_ch1  = ch1.ascii_upper_ch
  inner join  read_csv('stat_stat_chars.csv') as ch2
  on          stat_bigrams.ascii_upper_ch2 = ch2.ascii_upper_ch;
```
