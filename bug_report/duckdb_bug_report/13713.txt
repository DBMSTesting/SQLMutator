Title: Restore etag mechanism
Description:
Thanks @carlopi for the catch, this PR https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13700 broke the etag mechanism completely because updating uses force installing internally.

This PR adds another option to extension installing: `use_etags` which needs to be set explicitly. We set this only for the `update extensions` command so a force install will actually redownload regardless of the etag.

Testing this is a bit awkward, we could use the http proxy logs for this, but I feel the added test complexity and fragility is not really worth it here. I tested this PR locally and it seems to work nicely.
