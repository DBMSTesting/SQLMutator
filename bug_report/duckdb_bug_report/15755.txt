Title: Add support for deserializing a list of SetOperations in the SetOperationNode
Description:
This is a forwards-compatibility change. We plan to add support for multiple children to set operations, in particular to `UNION` operations, to avoid deeply nested trees. That did not make it in for this release - but this PR sets it up so that the system will be ready for these types of plans to be serialized into views in the storage format going forward.
