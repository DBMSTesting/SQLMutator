Title: odd `extract` interval behavior
Description:
### What happens?

In duckdb 1.0.0, using the python library, I ran the following:
```python
duckdb.sql("select datepart('year', INTERVAL '640 days')")
```
and it returned
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ datepart('year', CAST('640 days' AS INTERVAL)) │
│                     int64                      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                              0 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

I would have expected the answer to be 1, or perhaps for there to be an error warning me that the mapping from days to years is leap year-dependent but maybe there's some justification for this behavior.

### To Reproduce

Run the following:
```
import duckdb
duckdb.sql("select datepart('year', INTERVAL '640 days');")
```
