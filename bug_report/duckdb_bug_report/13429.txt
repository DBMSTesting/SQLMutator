Title: create_function -> Invalid Input Error: This function can not be called with an active transaction!, commit or abort the existing one first
Description:
### What happens?

  ```
conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
conn.execute(f"SELECT installed,loaded FROM duckdb_extensions() ;").fetchone()   
conn.create_function("line_3point_min_angle",CheckUdf.line_3point_min_angle )
```
before create_function,fetchone will be error 
`    conn.create_function(attr_name, attr_value,
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: This function can not be called with an active transaction!, commit or abort the existing one first`

but fetchall()  not error
```
 conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
conn.execute(f"SELECT installed,loaded FROM duckdb_extensions() ;").fetchall()
conn.create_function("line_3point_min_angle",CheckUdf.line_3point_min_angle )

```



### To Reproduce

```
    conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
    conn.execute(f"SELECT installed,loaded FROM duckdb_extensions() ;").fetchone()
    conn.create_function(CheckUdf.line_3point_min_angle, "line_3point_min_angle")
```
fetchone() then create_function will be error
```
conn.create_function(attr_name, attr_value,
duckdb.duckdb.InvalidInputException: Invalid Input Error: This function can not be called with an active transaction!, commit or abort the existing one first

```
but fetchall() not error
```
    conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
    conn.execute(f"SELECT installed,loaded FROM duckdb_extensions() ;").fetchall()
    conn.create_function(CheckUdf.line_3point_min_angle, "line_3point_min_angle")
