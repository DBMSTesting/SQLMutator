Title: Proper NULL handling in special json extraction functions
Description:
Following a [comment here](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13481#issuecomment-2360050486), I've decided to take a closer look at the `NULL` handling and return types of JSON extraction functions in PostgreSQL and BigQuery, and found that we were inconsistent:
1. While `json_extract`/`->` should return a JSON `null` value when doing, e.g., `SELECT '{"duck": null}'->'duck';`, `json_extract_string`/`->>`/`json_value` should return a SQL `NULL` value.
2. The return type of `json_value` should be `VARCHAR`, not `JSON`.

Both points were not implemented correctly in DuckDB, which this PR fixes.
