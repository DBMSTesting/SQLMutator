Title: aggregate(df).* is a syntax error but should be unnest(aggregate(df))
Description:
### What happens?

From my understanding of https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/expressions/star.html#struct, I should be able to apply `struct.*` anywhere, including on the result of an aggregate. 

### To Reproduce

```sql
FROM (
    SELECT unnest(range(10)) % 3, random(), random()
) df(id, value1, value2)
SELECT first(df).*
GROUP BY id
```
throws
```
 Parser Error: syntax error at or near "*"
```
but should do the same as 
```sql
FROM (
   SELECT unnest(range(10)) % 3, random(), random()
) df(id, value1, value2)
SELECT unnest(first(df))
GROUP BY id
```
```
