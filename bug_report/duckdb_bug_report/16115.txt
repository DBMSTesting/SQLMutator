Title: Adds pre-optimization hooks for DuckDB
Description:
It can sometimes be useful to run optimizers before DuckDB’s built-in optimizers to inspect and modify the raw logical query plan.

This PR introduces a hook that lets extensions register optimizer functions to run before DuckDB’s own optimizers.
