Title: Misleading error message in correlated subquery
Description:
### What happens?

Using non-existent columns of a pandas DataFrame within an EXISTS subquery produces the error message

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced table "df" not found!

### To Reproduce

```
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': [0, 1, 2, 3],
    'b': [1, 3, 5, 7]
})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3],
    'b': [-2, -4, 5, 4, 6, 1, -1]
})

result_df = duckdb.sql("""
SELECT df.a
FROM df
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM df2
    WHERE df2.aa = df.a AND df2.b < 0  -- Use of column df2.aa in place of df2.a
)
""").df()
print(result_df)
```
