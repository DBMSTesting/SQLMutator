Title: Race condition in parallel installations of extensions
Description:
### What happens?

When running multiple instances of DuckDB in parallel with the following command:

```
INSTALL httpfs;
INSTALL postgres;
```

I occasionally see one or more instances failing with the error:

```
IO Error: Could not remove file "$HOME/.duckdb/extensions/v1.0.0/linux_arm64/httpfs.duckdb_extension": No such file or directory
```

My guess is that each instance does something like:

1. Check an extension exists.
2. Delete the extension.

And that this results in a race condition between instances, e.g.

1. Instance 1 sees that an extension exists.
2. Instance 2 sees that an extension exists and deletes it.
3. Instance 1 tries to delete the extension but fails.

### To Reproduce

I am using the following script to reproduce the error:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

for i in $(seq 1 10); do
  duckdb -cmd 'install httpfs; install postgres;' :memory: &
done

sleep 10
```

And am running this several times on a Linux VM until the failure occurs (it can take a few executions).

```bash
while true; do
  rm -rf ~/.duckdb
  ./reproduce_extension_failure.sh
done
```

I cannot reproduce the failure when running on macOS, only Linux.
