Title: Duckdb incorrectly computes WAL path when using windows `\\?\` path prefix
Description:
### What happens?

When passing a windows path with the prefix `\\?\` ([see windows path docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file?redirectedfrom=MSDN#maximum-path-length-limitation)) to duckdb, it prepends the `.wal` extension before the question mark in the `\\?\` prefix, rather than appending it as normally expected.

### To Reproduce

```
import pathlib
import duckdb

print(pathlib.Path(r"\\?\\C:\Users\John\Downloads\abc.db").exists())
# prints True

duckdb.connect(r"\\?\\C:\Users\John\Downloads\abc.db")
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# duckdb.duckdb.IOException: IO Error: Cannot open file "\\.wal?\\c:\users\john\downloads\abc.db": The network path was not found.
```
