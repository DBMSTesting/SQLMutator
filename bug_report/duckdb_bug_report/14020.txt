Title: Seeing a single value changed after inserting ~1.5million row polars df to duckdb and then querying back out
Description:
### What happens?

When I write these 9 polars dataframes (saved as parquet files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18-xFUBLvPyux-erwETaATOV_fUpkLp4B?usp=sharing) to a duckdb table, I find that one single value from one single column is changed when I read the data back out.

### To Reproduce

First, download these 9 parquet files to your local machine: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18-xFUBLvPyux-erwETaATOV_fUpkLp4B?usp=sharing

Then, run the following code:
```
import duckdb
import polars as pl
import os
from datetime import date
from zipfile import ZipFile

### Constants
FILESDIR = "path_you_saved_downloaded_parquet_files_to" 
DAYS = range(1,10)
DUCKDB_FILE = os.path.join("path_you_saved_downloaded_parquet_files_to", "so_test.ddb")

### Read data from disk and write to duckdb
for day in DAYS:
    pldf = pl.read_parquet(os.path.join(FILESDIR, f"f{day}_masked.parquet"))
    with duckdb.connect(database=DUCKDB_FILE, read_only=False) as conn:
        if day == 1:
            conn.execute(f"CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE so_test AS SELECT * FROM pldf")
        else:
            conn.execute(f"INSERT INTO so_test SELECT * FROM pldf")        

### Verify that the data has changed by comparing a specific row from last df to its record in duckdb
PROBLEM_ROW = 1108956

print(pldf.slice(PROBLEM_ROW,1))  # hour=4.0
with duckdb.connect(database=DUCKDB_FILE, read_only=False) as conn:
    print(conn.execute(f"SELECT * from so_test WHERE (DAILY_FILE_ROW_ORDER = {PROBLEM_ROW}) and (DAILY_FILE_DATE = '2021-01-09')").pl())  # hour=3.0 now
```

Below is a screenshot of what I see when I run the code above. Note the rows are identical except `hour` has been changed from `4.0` to `3.0` (Also, I see `hour` for that row has been changed to `3.0` even if I read the result as a pandas `.df()`).
