Title: CSV Sniffer refuses to read simple file
Description:
### What happens?

DuckDB will not read this file as CSV no matter which settings I try.
[stops.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17804278/stops.txt)

```sql
select * from read_csv('stops.txt'); reads the file as a single column
select * from read_csv('stops.txt', header=true, delim=','); returns
```
```console
Invalid Input Error: Error when sniffing file "stops.txt".
It was not possible to automatically detect the CSV Parsing dialect/type
```

Adding additional parameters causes the same result.

### To Reproduce

Have the previously attached file available

```sql
select * from read_csv('stops.txt', header=true, delim=',');
```
