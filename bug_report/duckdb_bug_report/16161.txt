Title: Parquet Reader: Split `CreateReader` into two separate stages - `ParseSchema` and `CreateReader`
Description:
The current Parquet reader uses the ColumnReader for two purposes:

* Parsing schema metadata (getting the types/names and reading stats)
* Reading the data

This PR splits up these two cases. The `ParquetColumnSchema` class is added which fulfills the first purpose. The new `ParseSchema` method looks at a Parquet schema and converts that into a `ParquetColumnSchema`. This is used in the `ParquetReader` to obtain the result types of the file.

The column readers are now created using the `CreateReader` method *based on* the `ParquetColumnSchema` objects. As a result, creating the column readers is significantly simpler (as the Parquet metadata has already been parsed at this stage). We can also avoid creating column readers for columns we are not going to read - which can lead to significant performance improvements when we are only reading a small subset of the columns when reading small-ish files.
