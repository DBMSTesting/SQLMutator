Title: Parquet reader only uses performance cores, not e cores.
Description:
### What happens?

I have an Intel Core i9 14900K. It has 8 performance cores and 16 'e' cores (which are slower but more energy-efficient).

When I run a count on ~200 Parquet files around ~1.1GB each I can see the P cores maxing out but the e cores are left untouched.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT filename
FROM   READ_PARQUET('*.parquet', filename=true) a
WHERE  bbox.xmin > ?
AND    bbox.xmax < ?
AND    bbox.ymin > ?
AND    bbox.ymax < ?;
```

Is there some performance being left on the table here? Is this something that is within DuckDB's control?

The SSD these files are on can do ~600 MB/s but was averaging around 50-100 MB/s during the above count.

DuckDB's settings says it has 24 threads available.

```sql
D SELECT * FROM duckdb_settings() where value = '24';
```

```
