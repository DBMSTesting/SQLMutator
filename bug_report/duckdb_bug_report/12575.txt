Title: feat: new inet functions
Description:
Currently, INET extension is missing functions for INET range operations, related issue https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/10947.  
However, this PR aims to add the subnet contains operations and other helper functions.

* Add missing `BUILD_INET` in `Makefile`.
* All new functions works with IPv4/IPv6 and contains tests.
* Add five new INET functions compatible with PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-net.html):

`netmask` Computes the network mask for the address's network.
```sql
netmask(inet '192.168.1.5/24') → 255.255.255.0
```

`network` Returns the network part of the address, zeroing out whatever is to the right of the netmask.
```sql
network(inet '192.168.1.5/24') → 192.168.1.0/24
```

`broadcast` Computes the broadcast address for the address's network.
```sql
broadcast(inet '192.168.1.5/24') → 192.168.1.255/24
```

`<<=` Is subnet contained by or equal to subnet?
```sql
inet '192.168.1.5/32' <<= inet '192.168.1.0/24' → true
```

`>>=` Does subnet contain or equal subnet?
```sql
inet '192.168.1.5/32' >>= inet '192.168.1.0/24' → false
```
