Title: CLI: Replace \n with \r\n again in history again
Description:
This reverts to previous behavior - I mistakenly thought we didn't need to do this anymore now that we support all newline types in the history file, but it is still necessary to keep history with `\r\n` newlines in-memory as other code in the CLI relies on that behavior
