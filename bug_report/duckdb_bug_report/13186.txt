Title: [C API] Add duckdb_scalar_function_set_volatile that allows changing FunctionStability of a scalar function
Description:
Fixes #13128

Unless functions are marked as `Volatile` it is assumed that functions return the same output given the same input, which allows several optimizations to take place and short-circuit execution of the function for every row. This PR exposes this setting in the C API using the `duckdb_scalar_function_set_volatile` function:

```c
void duckdb_scalar_function_set_volatile(duckdb_scalar_function function);
```
