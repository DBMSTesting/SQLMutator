Title: toRelativeDayNum() and toRelativeHourNum() not working as expected in MacOS
Description:
**Description**
When running
`Starting ClickHouse 22.10.2.11 (revision: 54467, git hash: d2bfcaba0022ff70075078987cf253c6e0c12183, build id: <unknown>)`
on Apple M1 with
`Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0`
the toRelativeDayNum() and toRelativeHourNum() functions don't work as expected. Please see the following fiddle:

https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/8ef242b6-964e-4367-b778-52653336ad85

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes

**Expected behavior**

I'd expect those two functions to work just like their siblings (toRelative{Year,Quarter,...}Num()) 

**Schema**

```
create database if not exists helloworld;

create table if not exists helloworld.counter (metric_id String NOT NULL Codec(ZSTD(20)), timestamp DateTime64(9) Codec(DoubleDelta), value Float64 Codec(Gorilla)) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY metric_id;

insert into helloworld.counter values ('metric_A', '2022-01-01 01:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-02 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-03 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-04 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-05 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-06 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-07 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-08 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-09 00:00:00.000000000', 1), ('metric_A', '2022-01-09 01:00:00.000000000', 2);

// These four selects work on both MacOS and Fiddle
// select toRelativeYearNum(timestamp) as year, sum(value) as value from helloworld.counter group by year;
// select toRelativeQuarterNum(timestamp) as quarter, sum(value) as value  from helloworld.counter group by quarter;
// select toRelativeMonthNum(timestamp) as month, sum(value) as value  from helloworld.counter group by month;
// select toRelativeWeekNum(timestamp) as week, sum(value) as value  from helloworld.counter group by week;

// ...these queries come back empty on MacOS
// select toRelativeDayNum(timestamp) as day, sum(value) from helloworld.counter group by day;
// select toRelativeHourNum(timestamp) as hour, sum(value) as value from helloworld.counter group by hour;

// ...unless you do something like
// select 'foo', toRelativeDayNum(timestamp) as day, sum(value) from helloworld.counter group by day;
// select 'foo', toRelativeHourNum(timestamp) as hour, sum(value) as value from helloworld.counter group by hour;
