Title: Parameterized views can be created with parameters which are not allowed, for example table name
Description:
It is allowed to create a Parameterized views which never could be executed:
```
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS test AS
SELECT * FROM {data_table:Identifier};
```

There is no expectation that this view will work - we do not support it. If you try to execute it, there will be an error:
`DB::Exception: Both table name and UUID are empty. (UNKNOWN_TABLE)`

*What is expected*
if we try to create a parameterized view with table name as a parameter or other not supported features, there should be some error during CREATE VIEW statement, not after.
