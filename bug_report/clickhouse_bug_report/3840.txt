Title: Potential data loss - 18.14.18 -> 18.16.0 Changed behavior with Array(Tuple) columns
Description:
I have a table with an Array(Tuple(Date, UInt16)) column called _metrics. Noted after the upgrade to 18.16.0 that this table now had two columns - _metrics.1 Array(Date) and _metrics.2 Array(UInt16). I could no longer select on the _metrics column nor see any data from the _metrics.1 column (all arrays were empty).

I can recreate the table using CREATE TABLE .. AS .. SELECT - this works as expected. Following a server restart however the table reverts to the above behaviour. Additionally creating the table using plain CREATE TABLE rather than CTAS converts Array(Tuple) columns to Array columns as above.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Changing column definition automatically:

```
clickhouse-demo :) create table tuple_test (id UInt64, val Array(Tuple(Date, UInt16))) engine = MergeTree order by (id);

CREATE TABLE tuple_test
(
    id UInt64, 
    val Array(Tuple(Date, UInt16))
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec. 

clickhouse-demo :) desc tuple_test format PrettySpace;

DESCRIBE TABLE tuple_test
FORMAT PrettySpace

name    type            default_type   default_expression   comment_expression

id      UInt64                                                                
val.1   Array(Date)                                                           
val.2   Array(UInt16)                                                         

3 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 
```

2. Potential data loss:

```
drop table if exists tuple_test;
create table tuple_test engine = MergeTree order by tuple(id) as select 1 as id, [(toDate('2018-01-01'), 3),(toDate('2018-01-02'), 4)] as val;

CREATE TABLE tuple_test
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY tuple(id) AS
SELECT 
    1 AS id, 
    [(toDate('2018-01-01'), 3), (toDate('2018-01-02'), 4)] AS val

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec. 

clickhouse-demo :) desc tuple_test format TSV;

DESCRIBE TABLE tuple_test
FORMAT TSV

id	UInt8			
val	Array(Tuple(Date, UInt8))			

2 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec. 

clickhouse-demo :) select * from tuple_test format PrettySpace;

SELECT *
FROM tuple_test 
FORMAT PrettySpace

id   val                                

 1   [('2018-01-01',3),('2018-01-02',4)]

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 

## Restart server here

clickhouse-demo :) desc tuple_test format TSV;

DESCRIBE TABLE tuple_test
FORMAT TSV

id	UInt8			
val.1	Array(Date)			
val.2	Array(UInt8)			

3 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 

clickhouse-demo :) select * from tuple_test format PrettySpace;

SELECT *
FROM tuple_test 
FORMAT PrettySpace

id   val.1   val.2

 1   []      []   

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
