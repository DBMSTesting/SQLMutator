Title: Bug report: Strange error message "Unknown column: c3" while processing SELECT query with CTE
Description:
**Describe the bug**

I used my fuzzing tool to test ClickHouse (v21.5.6.6-stable), and found that it returned stange error message when processing a sql.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

**How to reproduce**

* ClickHouse server version: v21.5.6.6-stable
* Installation: 
```
1. mkdir build; cd build
2. cmake ..  \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug     \
        -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_ALL=OFF     \
        -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_SERVER=ON     \
        -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_CLIENT=ON     \
        -DENABLE_LIBRARIES=OFF     \
        -DUSE_UNWIND=ON     \
        -DENABLE_UTILS=OFF     \
        -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DSANITIZE=address
3. sudo make install
```

* Test command: 
```
1. clickhouse-server &

2. clickhouse-client --query '
create table t_q1ht4gq_5 (
c_zeij INTEGER NOT NULL,
c_fehk75l TEXT ,
c_jz TEXT ,
c_wynzuek TEXT ,
c_nkt INTEGER NOT NULL,
c_g TEXT ,
c_mc2 TEXT ,
primary key(c_nkt)
) engine = MergeTree();'

3. clickhouse-client --query '
WITH
cte_1 AS (select  
    subq_0.c0 as c1,
    subq_0.c0 as c2,
    subq_0.c0 as c3  
  from
    (select  
          ref_6.c_zeij as c0
        from 
          t_q1ht4gq_5 as ref_6
        ) as subq_0
  ), 

cte_2 AS (select  
    (ref_30.c_zeij <> ref_29.c_nkt) as c4 
  from 
    t_q1ht4gq_5 as ref_29
      inner join t_q1ht4gq_5 as ref_30
      on (ref_29.c_nkt = ref_30.c_zeij )
  )
select  
    (select c4 from cte_2 order by c4 limit 1 offset 5) as c3, 
    ref_34.c3 as c15 
  from 
    cte_1 as ref_34
;'
```

**Expected behavior**

Normally run without any error message

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

```
Received exception from server (version 21.5.6):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown column: c3, there are only columns c1, NULL, NULL.
```

**Additional context**

I am not sure whether this bug is duplicated with #25389 , but they looks different. So I hope you can help me confirm this issue.
