Title: Bloom filter is still used with not has
Description:
On a table with an ´array Array(Int32)´ and a data skipping index ´INDEX a array TYPE bloom_filter GRANULARITY 3´

When doing a ´Select count() from MyTable´ it’s return 500M 
When doing a ´Select count() from MyTable where has(array, 0)´ it’s return 90M .
When doing ´Select count() from MyTable Where not(has(array,0))’ it’s return 0, while the expected result is 410M. 

I think when there is a not, the index should just not be used and the query should return the same result as if there was no indexs.
