Title: RabbitMQ ENGINE randomly re publishing messages
Description:
**Describe the bug**
I have a table based on RabbitMQ ENGINE, I do inserts in that table and it works as expected and I am able to see incoming messages in rabbitmq. BUT from time to time I am getting this log message in the error log and exactly after that one of my previously posted messages becomes republished.

2021.02.23 17:43:16.443563 [ 21028 ] {} <Error> StorageRabbitMQ (test): Producer's channel 20 error: connection lost
2021.02.23 17:43:16.443671 [ 21028 ] {} <Error> StorageRabbitMQ (test): Library error report: connection lost


**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
 ClickHouse server version 21.2.4 revision 54447

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
ClickHouse server version 21.2.4 revision 54447
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
`drop table if exists clickhouse.test;
drop table if exists clickhouse.input;
drop table if exists clickhouse.clickhouse_mv;
drop table if exists clickhouse.clickhouse_mv;

CREATE TABLE clickhouse.test ( 
	key UInt64,
	value UInt64,
	date DateTime
) ENGINE = RabbitMQ SETTINGS rabbitmq_host_port = ' ',
	rabbitmq_exchange_name = 'test',
	rabbitmq_format = 'JSONEachRow',
	rabbitmq_persistent = 1,
	rabbitmq_num_consumers = 1;



CREATE TABLE clickhouse.input ( 
	key UInt64,
	value UInt64,
	date DateTime 
) Engine = MergeTree ORDER BY (date);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW clickhouse.clickhouse_mv TO clickhouse.test AS 
SELECT * FROM clickhouse.input;

INSERT INTO clickhouse.`input` (`key`, value) VALUES(52, 5221);
`

**Expected behavior**
I think once a message is published it should not be published again. 

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
