Title: Max and avg on the same null value should return the same answer
Description:
We are showing IoT results in a time series graph over x amount of time. We need to show max and average results but are getting zeros back for max when we would expect nulls in the following case:

avg(null, null, null) = null
max(null,null,null) = 0 (expect null here)

Once we have those results, we need to average but since max returns zero instead of null, we have more results to average, giving a false answer.

This also causes issues when we have states (0 and 1) on devices that only report changes. So if we max 3 nulls because a device has simply not had a change from 1 to 0, then the max still comes back as 0 which is not correct.

Expect to see:
avg(null, null, null) = null
max(null,null,null) = null

Any way of forcing this behaviour? It is vital so that we can display our 1000s of graph points correctly.
