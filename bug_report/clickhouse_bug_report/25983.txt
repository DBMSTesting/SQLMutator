Title: Why is the result of the Clickhouse query unstable
Description:
Clickhouse version: 20.12.3

When I execute this SQL query on the distributed table:

41 results are returned.

When I executed it again, I found that 43 results were returned.

After comparison, I found the two missing data and confirmed that the missing data were not inserted during this period; And the two data are on the same slice;

Log in to the corresponding partition to view the log_ ID finds the query log of the partition. It is found that the query is returned successfully and there is no exception in the log; Comparing the two SQL logs, the missing query logs have the following doubts:

1: There are multiple slow read logs
2: Peak memory usage (for query): 0.00 B.

Why does this happenï¼Ÿ
thanks.
