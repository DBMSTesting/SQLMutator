Title: Wrong results when using LowCardinality columns as join pivots (`USING` column) across tables 
Description:
**Describe the bug**
It seems LowCardinality(String) have different hashed value in different tables for the same string value.

I have a region column in different tables as type `LowCardinality(String)`, the JOIN seems to give empty rows for some values of Region while there are matching rows in the two subqueries.


**How to reproduce**
* ClickHouse server version : v19.4.3

* Example with two tables 

table 1
``` sql
CREATE TABLE test.quants
(
    TS                         DateTime,
    Region                  LowCardinality(String),
    Metric                   LowCardinality(String),
    QuantAvg             Float64,
    Updated               DateTime
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(Updated)
PARTITION BY (Region, toYYYYMM(TS))
PRIMARY KEY (Region, TS)
ORDER BY (Region, TS,Metric)
```

table 2
``` sql
CREATE TABLE test.trends
(
    TS                         DateTime,
    Region                  LowCardinality(String),
    Metric                   LowCardinality(String),
    TrendAvg             Float64,
    Updated               DateTime
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(Updated)
PARTITION BY (Region, toYYYYMM(TS))
PRIMARY KEY (Region, TS)
ORDER BY (Region, TS,Metric)
```

Now the following join queries will give empty results even while having matching rows for some regions while correct results for others.
``` sql
SELECT TS,Region,Metric, QuantAvg, TrendAvg FROM 
(
      SELECT 
             TS,Region,Metric,QuantAvg 
      FROM test.quants
      WHERE Region = 'asia'
) ALL LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT 
             TS,Region,Metric, TrendAvg 
      FROM test.trends
      WHERE Region = 'asia'
) USING TS,Region,Metric
```
