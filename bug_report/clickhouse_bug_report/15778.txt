Title: Update Incorrect
Description:
Update with wrong value.

```sql
`job_state` Nullable(Int8)
```
The current job_state value is 3, I want to update it to 10

```sql
ALTER TABLE xxx UPDATE job_state = 10 WHERE name = 'xxx';
```

But after the execution, the value becomes -24, and does not change when update again.
