Title: Update table to date fields using toDateOrNull generates unexpected behaviour
Description:
**Describe the unexpected behaviour**

I have this table with a field `Nullable(my_date)`. I intend to update some field with another date, but sometimes this date may not be set. So, using the query above does change the field value, but with not the expected one.

---
```sql
alter table
  my_db.my_table
update
  my_field = toDateOrNull('2020-08-02')
where name = 'some_name_here'
```
---
**Result**
|  name | dt  |  val |
|---|---|---|
|   Car | 2027-12-08  | Missan  |

---
**Expected Result**
|  name | dt  |  val |
|---|---|---|
|   Car | 2020-08-02  | Missan  |
---
**The problem here** seems to be OrNull word. The result of the update field is `2027-12-08`, but when I use just toDate [`my_field = toDate('2020-08-02')`] the field value is the correct one
