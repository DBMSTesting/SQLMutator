Title: ON CLUSTER query gives: DB::Exception: Cannot provide query execution status
Description:
I'm getting the following error very randomly about a dozen times a day:

Code: 341, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Cannot provide query execution status. The query's node /clickhouse/task_queue/ddl/query-0000269928 has been deleted by the cleaner since it was finished (or its lifetime is expired) (version 20.10.3.30 (official build))

The error occurs on the following two query types: Truncate / ALTER TABLE

I can't 100% repoduce as it happens randomly, but last time I had it happen, I was running about a dozen ALTER TABLE UPDATE queries (in series), and it would fail sometimes on query 1, sometimes on query 8 etc. 100% random.

Is there some sort of setting that the cleaner uses to delete the queries node that can be adjusted or is this a bug?
