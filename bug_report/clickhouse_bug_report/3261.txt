Title: Use of datetime fuction required when using datetime function in primary key for SummingMergeTree
Description:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test
(
    created_at DateTime,
    value      UInt64
)
    ENGINE = SummingMergeTree((value))
        PARTITION BY toDate(created_at)
        ORDER BY (toStartOfFiveMinute(created_at));

INSERT INTO test
VALUES (now(), 1);

SELECT *
FROM test
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2018-09-01 00:00:00' AND now()
```

Throws 
>  DB::Exception: Illegal type String of argument of function toStartOfFiveMinute.

This works 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM test
WHERE created_at BETWEEN toDateTime('2018-09-01 00:00:00') AND now()
```
but for standard queries is not requied to convert datetime string to datetime.
