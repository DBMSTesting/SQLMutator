Title: Deleting rows causes Bad size of marks file error
Description:
**Describe the bug**
After executing the following command:
```
ALTER TABLE table DELETE WHERE pageviews < '2020-06-17'
```
The query executes and running `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pageviews` runs correctly; however, running the following query on the table throws an error:
```
SELECT DISTINCT topic_id, uniqExact(content_id) content_count FROM pageviews WHERE user_id = 1 GROUP BY topic_id
```

The error is as follows:
```
Code: 246, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Bad size of marks file '/var/lib/clickhouse/data/default/pageviews/20191222_0_21_2_46/content_id.null.mrk2': 0, must be: 4440: While executing MergeTreeThread (version 20.3.5.21 (official build))
```

**How to reproduce**
* ClickHouse 20.3.5.21 via Docker in Kubernetes
* Any interface
* Table is a ReplicatedMergeTree

From what I've noticed, the issue happens with any ReplicatedMergeTree regardless of schema. The delete operation involved deleting approximately 170 million rows.

I can't see any errors in the server logs for the actual delete command, so it just seems like the files in question aren't updated as intended?
