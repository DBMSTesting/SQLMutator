Title: In the version 20.4.4.18 when change the receive_timeout parameter that will not work
Description:
1. I try to change the receive_timeout parameter through two ways
1.1 set receive_timeout = xxxxx
1.2 added receive_timeout into the users.xml
both methods when i check the system.settings table, this will show the value which i changed.

However when this changed
i still can get this result
Timeout exceeded while receiving data from server. Waited for 300 seconds, timeout is 300 seconds.
Cancelling query.

2. Then i see the source code about this part, maybe i check the wrong part, but i find this
In the file ConnectionParameters.cpp

and this DBMS_DEFAULT_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_SEC is the macro

And this value will be the parameter for the ConnectionTimeoutsâ€˜s Constructor
and i see the Server.cpp

looks like this part can read the settings value
so i am not sure why this setting is not working when really execute query


Thanks
