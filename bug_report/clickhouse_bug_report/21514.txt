Title: clickhouse-client sometimes hangs on server exception
Description:
**Describe the bug**
We're inserting data into ClickHouse using clickhouse-client. Sometimes when a server error occurs the client is stuck indefinitely with no output.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
21.2.5.5

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
21.2.5.5

* Which interface to use, if matters
clickhouse-client

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
zstd -d --stdout file.tsv.zst |
clickhouse-client --host localhost --port 9001 \
  --min_insert_block_size_rows=100000000 \
  --min_insert_block_size_bytes=4000000000 \
  --max_insert_block_size=16777216 \
  --query='
    INSERT INTO database.tmp_table (column1, column2, ..., columnN) FORMAT TSV
  '
```
The compressed input file is usually 5GB or larger in size. 
We run quite a few such commands and sometimes there is an error and the process is stuck doing nothing.

**Expected behavior**
In case of errors, the clickhouse-client should exit properly.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
