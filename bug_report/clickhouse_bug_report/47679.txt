Title: SIGSEGV while uploading to S3 for part > INT_MAX
Description:
Reproducer:

```sql
INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/clickhouse/test.csv', '', '', 'TSV')
SETTINGS s3_truncate_on_insert = 1, s3_max_single_part_upload_size = '10Gi'
SELECT repeat('a', 1024)
FROM numbers((pow(2, 30) * 5) / 1024)
SETTINGS s3_truncate_on_insert = 1, s3_max_single_part_upload_size = '10Gi'
```

Note, that usually it is not a problem since multi part upload is used, but when you turn it OFF you can see the problem.

And the problem is the `stringstream::gcount` breaks `stringstream` when it holds more the `INT_MAX`
