Title: Random Load Balance Policy returns Inconsistent Results on Select
Description:
**Describe the bug**
The default `load_balancing` policy, `random`, returns inconsistent results for subsequent queries for a distributed table pointing to a 6-node 6-shard 2-replica cluster of materialized view tables.

Switching the `load_balancing` setting to `in_order` (mostly) resolves the issue.  `in_order` still breaks during restarts (doesn't seem to query the other healthy replica for the shard).

**How to reproduce**
* Version: 19.9.2 revision 54421
* Configure a cluster with 2-way replication sharing nodes. (e.g. 2 nodes, 2 shards, 2-way replication)
* Create a raw data table and insert some data on all servers.
* Create a MV table with the ReplicatedAggregatingMergeTree engine on the raw table.
* Create a distributed table on top of that MV.
* Set load_balancing to random
* Query table and observe inconsistent results.

We will work on putting together an example to try and reproduce the bug.
