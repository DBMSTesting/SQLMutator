Title: Strange error for distributed table engine
Description:
**Describe the bug**
I got error "Table default.test_all_2 doesn't exist.. "  when I executed tables join  with distributed table engine
I already entered database credit_ga, but it report the table doesn't exist in database default, so it's strange
but when I use global join instead of join, I got the result as below.
additional, by my testing, result for global join and join is same for two tables of distributed table engine,
only one table with distributed table engine joins another table with no distributed table engine, which need global join.
so can you explain?thanks

**How to reproduce**
test-1-118.raipeng.com :) use credit_ga
