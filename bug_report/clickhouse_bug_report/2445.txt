Title: Nested data type incorrect empty insert issue
Description:
Steps to reproduce:

1. Create table with the following structure:

```
xxxx :) CREATE TABLE test.cmdts_test (  cmdts Nested( cmdty_id Nullable(UInt16), cmdty_name Nullable(String), cmdty_group_id Nullable(UInt16), cmdty_group_name Nullable(String)) ) ENGINE = Log

CREATE TABLE test.cmdts_test
(
    cmdts Nested(
    cmdty_id Nullable(UInt16),
    cmdty_name Nullable(String),
    cmdty_group_id Nullable(UInt16),
    cmdty_group_name Nullable(String))
)
ENGINE = Log

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
```
2. Insert data by leaving one of the fields empty(not NULL, but empty square brackets)

```
xxxx :) INSERT INTO test.cmdts_test VALUES ([5], ['myname'], [], ['fafa'])

INSERT INTO test.cmdts_test VALUES

Ok.

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
```
3. Now select from that table

```
xxxx :) SELECT * FROM test.cmdts_test;

SELECT *
FROM test.cmdts_test


Exception on client:
Code: 89. DB::Exception: Unknown compression method: 108: while receiving packet from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1

Connecting to localhost:9000.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 1.1.54383.
```

**With NULL value passed, works as expected, however.** I guess it would be nice to assume if no value is passed for that nested field, then the values should be NULL. Or at least the insert shouldn't pass.
