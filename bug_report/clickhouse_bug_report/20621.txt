Title: Issue when copying data with aggregateFunction(avg, ....) between servers
Description:
We are trying to copy data from one server with version 20.5.2.7 (official build) to another one version 21.1.2.15 (official build)

After copying all data we have acknowledged that there are differences in several fields that are defined as avg aggregateFuncion in this way
```
....
`duration` AggregateFunction(avg, UInt32),
`scroll` AggregateFunction(avg, UInt8),    
`rfv` AggregateFunction(avg, UInt32),
....
```

We have reproduced the bug in this simplier way

First, we have created a test table in each of the servers
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS compass.test_merge
(

    `scroll` AggregateFunction(avg, UInt8)
)
ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
ORDER BY tuple()
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

After that we export one of the problematic rows to a csv
```
echo "SELECT scroll from compass.m_hits_day_1 WHERE event_time < toDateTime('2021-02-16 07:30:00') AND site_id=108 AND finalizeAggregation(scroll) = 43.89265536723164 FORMAT CSV" > /tmp/query.sql
cat /tmp/query.sql | clickhouse-client --password OLD_SERVER_PASS --host OLD_SERVER_HOST --max_memory_usage 40G > /tmp/hits.csv
```
So we have a csv with only one row with a binary value ([csv content here](https://nrbi.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/hits.csv))


Then, we uploaded this csv to the test table in each server
```
cat /tmp/hits.csv | clickhouse-client --password OLD_SERVER_PASS --host OLD_SERVER_HOST --max_memory_usage 40G --query="INSERT INTO compass.test_merge FORMAT CSV"
cat /tmp/hits.csv | clickhouse-client --password NEW_SERVER_PASS --host NEW_SERVER_HOST --max_memory_usage 40G --query="INSERT INTO compass.test_merge FORMAT CSV"
```

When we checked the data uploaded in each server we saw
```
***** OLD SERVER
SELECT *
FROM compass.test_merge

┌─scroll─┐
│ Y�      │
└────────┘


SELECT finalizeAggregation(scroll)
FROM compass.test_merge

┌─finalizeAggregation(scroll)─┐
│           43.89265536723164 │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```


***** NEW SERVER
```
SELECT *
FROM compass.test_merge

┌─scroll─┐
│ Y1     │
└────────┘



SELECT finalizeAggregation(scroll)
FROM compass.test_merge

┌─finalizeAggregation(scroll)─┐
│          158.55102040816325 │
