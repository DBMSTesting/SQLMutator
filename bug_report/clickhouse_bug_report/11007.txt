Title: Copier deletes a MATERIALIZED column even if it was in the partitioning key. 
Description:
ClusterCopier uses distributed tables to insert data to target cluster and to perform resharding. It creates internal distributed tables on each shard with a subset of original columns (It deletes `MATERIALIZED` columns and columns with `ALIAS` not to send useless data over the network) : https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/c76a82777c8b28608a3dfa0640cc6a003b1746bb/dbms/programs/copier/ClusterCopier.cpp#L2159-L2161

However, these columns could be in PARTITION key, SAMPLE key or whatever.  And it leads to exceptions.
