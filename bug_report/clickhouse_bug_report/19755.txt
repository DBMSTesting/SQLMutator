Title: Segfault in Expression analyzer found with fuzzer
Description:
**Describe the bug**

The query:
```
SELECT
    (current_database = currentDatabase()) AND (type = 0),
    ((current_database = currentDatabase()) AND (type = NULL)) AND (type = NULL) AND ((current_database = currentDatabase()) AND (type = 1048575)) AND (type = NULL) AND (event_date >= yesterday())
FROM system.query_log
ARRAY JOIN ProfileEvents
WHERE ProfileEvents AND (current_database = currentDatabase())
ORDER BY event_time DESC NULLS FIRST
LIMIT 0
```
crashes the server.
