Title: Incorrect type of `Date` is generated by mysql table function and MySQL database engine for corresponding DATE type of MySQL.
Description:
**Company or project name**

CH

**Describe what's wrong**

CH mysql engine incorrectly places MySQL `DATE` type into its `Date` type, while it should be `Date32` type. Apparently CH is calculating date based on its interpretation of `Date32` type, where date is number of days around day zero at 1970-01-01 represented by Int32 - i.e. negative values represent dates before day zero. While it seems CH engine correctly calculates negative values, it then generates `Date` type - which is UInt32 (1970-01-01 and above), and puts negative value into this type which results in overflow with some meaningless date (represented by a complement of this negative value)

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

yes

**How to reproduce**

Create table in MySQL containing DATE field, put some dates before 1970-01-01. Then select from this table in CH using `mysql` table function.

**Expected behavior**

CH field type should be `Date32` with correct dates before 1970-01-01
