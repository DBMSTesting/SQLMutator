Title: INSERT parsing bug - when there is a trailing comment
Description:
Clickhouse can't parse a multirow INSERT that has a trailing comment/metadata. See the following screenshot for an example and the exception it produces.  

Note:  the trailing comment
Note:  if the INSERT is for only one row (not many) then a trailing comment is not a problem

This bug was exposed when I was using [a hex notebook](https://hex.tech/) because their notebooks supply query metadata in a trailing comment.
