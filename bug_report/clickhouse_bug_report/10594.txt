Title: read error: EOF
Description:
In our company we have golang tool, which sends data in batches to clickhouse. When clickhouse server runs for a few day (about 14 days) our driver is sometime unable to connect to the server with the following debug message:
```
[clickhouse]host(s)=DOMAIN:9000, database=default, username=default
[clickhouse][dial] secure=false, skip_verify=false, strategy=random, ident=1, server=0 -> IP:9000
[clickhouse][connect=1][hello] -> Golang SQLDriver 1.1.54213
[clickhouse][connect=1][connect] read error: EOF
```

The problem persist even when I try to connect to the server on that machine:
```
ClickHouse client version 20.3.4.10 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Code: 32. DB::Exception: Attempt to read after eof
```
(sometimes it connects sometimes not)

When we restart the clickhouse server then everything goes back to normal.
Nothing is present in error log.
There are average of 180 active connections to the clickhouse server.

Do you recommend any further steps to trace this issues?

Thank you
