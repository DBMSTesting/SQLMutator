Title: Segfault in JOIN with join_algorithm='auto' with Nullable(String) vs LowCardinality(String) in JOIN key
Description:
CH version 20.3.15.133
When I run the following queries:

CH is segfaulted with the following stack trace:

I suspect that problem is related to the following condition:
`(t.size_name = d.size_name)`

When I add a condition `WHERE size_name != null` to sub-query from:
`FROM crawler.wb_add_info_sizes AS t`

The query is executed successfully. Seems there is a bug with determining whether join condition has nullable columns or not.
