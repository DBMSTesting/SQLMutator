Title: "Unknown column name" in a query with multiple joins and enable_optimize_predicate_expression=1 
Description:

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
latest master/trunk version

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```sql
di.man.yp-c.yandex.net :) select * from (select * from (select * from numbers(10)) as a join (select * from numbers(10)) as b on a.number = b.number join (select * from numbers(10)) as c on b.number = c.number) where a.number = 0

SELECT *
FROM 
(
    SELECT *
    FROM 
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM numbers(10)
    ) AS a
    INNER JOIN 
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM numbers(10)
    ) AS b ON a.number = b.number
    INNER JOIN 
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM numbers(10)
    ) AS c ON b.number = c.number
)
WHERE a.number = 0
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
Received exception from server (version 21.5.1):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown column name 'a.number': While processing SELECT `--a.number` AS `a.number`, `--b.number` AS `b.number`, c.number AS `c.number` FROM (SELECT * FROM numbers(10)) AS a INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM numbers(10)) AS b ON a.number = b.number INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM numbers(10)) AS c ON b.number = c.number HAVING `a.number` = 0. 
```

**Additional context**
With `enable_optimize_predicate_expression=0` this query works fine.
Fix for #20497 does not help.
