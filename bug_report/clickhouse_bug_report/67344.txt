Title: regex match() wrong result when using (?-s) flag
Description:
Context: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions#match
> Unlike re2's default behavior, `.` matches line breaks. To disable this, prepend the pattern with `(?-s)`.

**Describe what's wrong**
Prepending the pattern with `(?-s)` to disable `.` matching line breaks will lead to wrong results, all select queries in this fiddle should output `1`:
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/abdfcd96-12bf-4c6b-a6ff-61db29301f86

It can be reproduced in most, but not all versions after `22.12.6.22-alpine` (it starts to not work as expected in version `23`). It can be reproduced on the most recent release as well.

**A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.**
`SELECT match('bob', '(?s)bob')` should output 1 but instead it outputs 0
`SELECT match('bob', '(?-s)bob')` should output 1 but instead it outputs 0

**Workaround**
I found a way around it by additionally providing the case-insensitive re2 flag to the query:
- case sensitive match `SELECT match('bob', '(?-is)bob')` will output 1 as expected
- case insensitive match `SELECT match('bOb', '(?i-s)bob')` will output 1 as expected
