Changelog entry (a user-readable short description of the changes that goes to CHANGELOG.md):
Optimize `has()`, `indexOf()` and `countEqual()` functions for `Array(LowCardinality(T))` and constant right arguments.

The `arrayIndex.h` holding aforementioned functions doesn't have the specialization for `Array(LowCardinality(T))` arguments, so they are converted to ordinary columns, which disables the ability to search in their dictionary (useful for constant right arguments). 

Also fixes the unsigned insert/select bug, see the test (inserting -1 into unsigned columns) for detail.
