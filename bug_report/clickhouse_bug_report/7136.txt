Title: Predicate expression optimizer causes segmentation fault with version 19.13.3.26
Description:
When set the `enable_optimize_predicate_expression` to `1`, the following query will cause segmentation fault.
```SQL
SET enable_optimize_predicate_expression = 1;
SELECT
    ccc
FROM
(
    SELECT 1 AS ccc
    UNION ALL
    SELECT *
    FROM
    (
        SELECT 2 AS ccc
    )
    ANY INNER JOIN
    (
        SELECT 2 AS ccc
    ) USING (ccc)
)
WHERE ccc > 1;
```
But do any of the following operation, the query will wok.
* Set the `enable_optimize_predicate_expression` to `0`
* Remove `SELECT 1 AS ccc` or `WHERE ccc > 1` or the `JOIN` subquery
* Replace `*` by `ccc`
