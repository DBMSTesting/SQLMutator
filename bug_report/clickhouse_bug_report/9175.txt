Title: Access to dictionary may be blocked during reloading
Description:
in versions 19.16 and 19.17 (not sure when was introduced, I didn't check older versions) dictionaries in state `LOADED_AND_RELOADING` maybe not accessible and selects were waiting for dictionary reloads instead of using the previous state of the dictionary. 

It looks like the issue was fixed already (most probably here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/8240 ), adding the issue just to document it.
