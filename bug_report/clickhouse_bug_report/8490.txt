Title: A "where in" test is failing without distinct
Description:
I have a tables of the form:

- t1 with column c1 
- t2 with column c2
- t3 with column c1 and c2

and a query, Q1, of the form:

```
select c1 from t1 
where c1 in (
     select c1 from t2 left join t3 using c2
)
```
The result of Q1 did not include a value of c1 that I expected (say "x") so I ran the two parts separately in queries Q2:
```
select c1 from t1
```
and Q3:
```
select c1 from t2 left join t3 using c2
```
both of Q2 and Q3 included the expected value ("x"). 

In trying to understand what was happening, modified Q1 into Q4:
```
select c1 from t1 
where c1 in (
     select disctinct c1 from t2 left join t3 using c2
)
```
The result of that query did include the expected value "x". 

Is it required that `where in` conditions use `distinct ` in their select clauses?

If not, is there some way for me to debug why the query Q1 did not include "x" when the component queries Q2 and Q3 do, and the modified query Q4 does as well? 

Or, as is always a possibility, am I completely missing something that may explain this?

Thanks in advance for any help.
