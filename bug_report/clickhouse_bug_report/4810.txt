Title: Wrong query result if types are inconsistent. 18.14.18+
Description:
```
ClickHouse server version 18.14.18

drop table if exists test;
CREATE TABLE test(f Int32) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY (f);
insert into test values(107161);

1. select count() from test where f in ( 107161);
┌─count()─┐
│       1 │
└─────────┘

2. select count() from test where toUInt32(f) in (select 107161);
┌─count()─┐
│       1 │
└─────────┘

3. select count() from test where f in (select toInt32(107161));
┌─count()─┐
│       1 │
└─────────┘

4. select count() from test where f in (select 107161);
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec.

Query 4 uses index (order by) and has Int32 vs UInt32
