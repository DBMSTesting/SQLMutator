Title: Clickhouse Keeper v22.7 crashing on every startup with segfault 11
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Clickhouse keeper is crashing during initialization with segfault. This repeats on every start - we're unable to start the keeper server, either from existing data or from the new ones, it always crashes after a few minutes of initializing. We're running a standalone dockerized keeper instance.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes, we're using the version v22.7 of keeper.

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 

We tested these versions (so far) and all are crashing with the same error
```
v22.7.1.2484
v22.7.4.16
v22.8.2.11
---
v22.5.1.2079 
```

* Non-default settings, if any:

We tweaked some configurations which may be related, though it's inconclusive on our side:

```
    <coordination_settings>
      <force_sync>false</force_sync>
      <max_requests_batch_size>2000</max_requests_batch_size>
    </coordination_settings>
```

**Expected behavior**

We don't expect the process to crash.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

```

Seems like this node recovers from leaders snapshot, removing all logs
