Title: HTTP: cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close=1 fails with 19.14
Description:
With the 19.14 series this hangs:

```
curl 'http://localhost:8123/?query=SELECT%201&cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close=1'
```

When the `cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close` setting is omitted or set to `0`, it works.

With the 19.13 series and earlier the above request successfully returns results as expected. (We did not check if it correctly cancelled the requests but assume so.)

The `cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close` feature is documented as: "Cancel HTTP readonly queries when a client closes the connection without waiting for response."

I haven't investigated why test `00834_cancel_http_readonly_queries_on_client_close.sh` passes but it looks like that test may be flawed or have missing coverage.
