Title: ALTER TABLE UPDATE with subquery could not finished
Description:
Creating test table and view
```
CREATE TABLE test
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY m10_1 AS
SELECT
    number + 100 AS m10_1,
    0 AS test
FROM numbers(50)
```
```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW t1 AS
SELECT
    number * 10 AS id,
    number * 100 AS value
FROM numbers(20)
```
Run update (This statement is unable to finish)
```
ALTER TABLE test UPDATE test = (SELECT groupArray(id) FROM t1)[m10_1 - 99] WHERE 1
```
I had tried many statements with subquery and all of them hangs.
