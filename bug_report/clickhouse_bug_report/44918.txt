Title: Wrong output with transform function, when output is float32
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

The following:

    select transform(number, [1], [toFloat32(1)], toFloat32(1)) from numbers(3)

outputs:

    1
    0
    1

**Expected behavior**

It should output:

    1
    1
    1

It seems like anything matching the `array_from` argument will output 0, when the output type is float32. It seems to work as it should with other types.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

I've reproduced on ClickHouse playground, I assume that's running the latest version.
