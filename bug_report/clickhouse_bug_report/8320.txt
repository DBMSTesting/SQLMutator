Title: Unconsitant behavour between dictGet and  dictGetString
Description:
This request :
```
SELECT 
   dictGet('dictId', 'name', toUInt64(dictId)) AS name,
   dictGet( 'dictId', 'age',toUInt64(dictId)) AS age 
  FROM 
     users  
  GROUP BY name
```
Do not work because
`Column dictId is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY`
which seems expected because we are indeed not grouping on name.

But this query work and I dont enderstand why.
```
SELECT 
   dictGetString('dictId', 'name', toUInt64(dictId)) AS name,
   dictGet( 'dictId', 'age',toUInt64(dictId)) AS age 
  FROM 
     users  
  GROUP BY name
```
I'm afraid of a different implementation beween `dictGetString` and `dictGet`.
