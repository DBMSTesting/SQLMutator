Title: S3 table endpoint region configuration constrained to the amazonaws domain
Description:
Hi, first of all thank you for a great piece of software.

**Describe the bug**

PR  #15646 fixes #10417 by matching the S3 endpoint region using the following regular expression: `s3.<region>.amazonaws`. Attempting to use an S3 compatible storage engine hosted outside of AWS an authentication error due to mismatch with the default region (`us-east-1`).

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Reproduces on `ClickHouse server version 21.4.5.46 (official build)`

**How to reproduce?**

The following query fails:

`SELECT * from s3('https://s3.gra.cloud.ovh.net/..., 'key', 'secret', 'csv', '...') LIMIT 10`

**Expected behavior**

One potential solution would be to allow the region to be specified in the S3 disk settings (adding vendor-specific regexp patterns in  `PocoHTTPClientConfiguration::updateSchemeAndRegion` seems unrealistic).
