Title: "Alter table" can alter some other table
Description:
A very interesting thing happened to me today.
I needed to change the structure of an MV, so I detached the MV definition, renamed the .inner. table (`rename table db.".inner.event_shard" to db.event_shard_old`) and created a new MV which created a new .inner. table (`db..inner.event_shard`).
Then I copied the data from the old MV into the new MV, and I dropped one partition from the old MV.
I ran the drop query on one replica.
Unfortunately CH somehow remembered that the old MV was renamed, and changed the query before sending it to the leader, so the partition got dropped from the new MV.
Fortunately, only one shard had to send the query to the leader, the other four shards happened to be the leaders for this table, so they dropped data from the old MV.

The log from a leader (it dropped a partition from db.event_shard_old):
```

The log from the non-leader (it dropped a partition from db..inner.event_shard):
