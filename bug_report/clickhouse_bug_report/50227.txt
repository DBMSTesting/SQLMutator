Title: Unexpected error: Cannot find column ... in ActionsDAG result
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

The SELECT statement should output results normally, but it threw an exception.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

It can be reproduced in the latest version.

**How to reproduce**

Version: 23.5.1.1 (commit 3e6314675c6467bc4dd78f659bac862f7e9648f8)

Easy reproduce in ClickHouse fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/a945cb10-24b7-4e0a-832a-4436012ce46f

_Set up database_

```sql
create table t0 (vkey UInt32, primary key(vkey)) engine = MergeTree;
create view t3 as 
select distinct 
    ref_0.vkey as c_2_c16_0
  from 
    t0 as ref_0;
insert into t0 values (4);
```

_Bug-triggering query_

```sql
with cte_4 as (select
    rank() over w0 as c_2_c2398_0
  from
    t3 as ref_15
  window w0 as (partition by ref_15.c_2_c16_0 order by ref_15.c_2_c16_0 desc))
select distinct
    ref_39.c_2_c2398_0 as c_9_c2479_0
  from
    cte_4 as ref_39;
```

**Expected behavior**

The SELECT statement is executed without any error.

**Actual behavior**

It throws an exception:
```
Received exception from server (version 23.4.2):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot find column rank() OVER w0 in ActionsDAG result. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER)
(query: with cte_4 AS (select
    rank() over w0 as c_2_c2398_0
  from
    t3 as ref_15
  window w0 as (partition by ref_15.c_2_c16_0 order by ref_15.c_2_c16_0 desc))
select distinct
    ref_39.c_2_c2398_0 as c_9_c2479_0
  from
    cte_4 as ref_39;)
```

**Additional context**

The earliest reproducible version is 23 in fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/9fdcd19a-95b3-49d9-9c3c-f3dfa8f47875. 

Before version 23, the query can be executed without any error (e.g. no error in 22.12.6.22-alpine, https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/8a3dc3d1-d795-40ac-803e-2be0b3da1089). It outputs one row:

```
+-------------+
| c_9_c2479_0 |
+-------------+
|           1 |
+-------------
```
