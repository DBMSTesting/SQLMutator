Title: Group-by query keep changing results when enable distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**

Group-by query keep changing results when enable distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient

** version

v20.3.8.53


**How to reproduce**

 Hard to reproduce locally
 
**Additional context**
```
cat ~/a.sql
 
SELECT uid
    FROM
    (
        SELECT uid
        FROM app.app_user_info_day_all
        WHERE ((day >= '2020-10-01') AND (day <= '2020-10-01')) AND (charge_countrycode IN ('FR', 'BE'))
        GROUP BY uid
    )
    GROUP BY uid
 settings max_threads = 32, skip_unavailable_shards = 0
```

```
for i in `seq 1 30`;do cat ~/a.sql | clickhouse-client --distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient 1  | wc -l
done

522139
522139

499914
522139

522139
522139
```


```
for i in `seq 1 30`;do cat ~/a.sql | clickhouse-client --distributed_aggregation_memory_efficient 0  | wc -l
done
522139
522139
522139
522139
522139
522139
522139
```

```
> grep -Eo 'Total aggregated. [0-9]+' 499914_trace.log | sort > a.log
> grep -Eo 'Total aggregated. [0-9]+' 522139_trace.log | sort > b.log
> diff a.log b.log


```


Total aggregated value are the same , no differs â€¦

If I use settings max_threads = 1, it's a stable result too.
