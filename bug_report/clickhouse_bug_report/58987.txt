Description:
`Code: 121. DB::Exception: Unsupported JOIN keys in StorageJoin. Type: 8: While executing Join. (UNSUPPORTED_JOIN_KEYS) (version 23.10.6.60 (official build))`


this query **work in 23.8**, 23.10 - 23.12 not work

```sql
SELECT
    segmented_ctr_cache.product_id,
    segmented_ctr_cache.segment_id,
    count_in_bookmark,
    count_in_cart
FROM segmented_ctr_cache
LEFT JOIN cart_join ON
          cart_join.product_id = segmented_ctr_cache.product_id
      AND cart_join.segment_id = segmented_ctr_cache.segment_id
LEFT JOIN bookmarks_join ON
          bookmarks_join.product_id = segmented_ctr_cache.product_id
      AND bookmarks_join.segment_id = segmented_ctr_cache.segment_id

CREATE TABLE bookmarks_join
(
  product_id Int32,
  segment_id Int32,
  count_in_bookmark Int32
) ENGINE = Join(ALL, LEFT, product_id, segment_id)

CREATE TABLE cart_join
(
product_id Int32,
segment_id Int32,
count_in_cart Int32
) ENGINE = Join(ALL, LEFT, product_id, segment_id)
```

**problem in multiple join columns**, next query work in 23.10 - 23.12

```sql
SELECT
    segmented_ctr_cache.product_id,
    segmented_ctr_cache.segment_id,
    count_in_bookmark,
    count_in_cart

LEFT JOIN cart_join ON
          cart_join.product_id = segmented_ctr_cache.product_id
LEFT JOIN bookmarks_join ON
          bookmarks_join.product_id = segmented_ctr_cache.product_id

CREATE TABLE bookmarks_join
(
  product_id Int32,
  segment_id Int32,
  count_in_bookmark Int32
) ENGINE = Join(ALL, LEFT, product_id)

CREATE TABLE cart_join
