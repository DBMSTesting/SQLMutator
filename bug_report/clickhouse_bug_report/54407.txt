Title: Method createColumn() is not implemented for data type Function (23.3 backward incompatibility)
Description:
Using array functions in JOIN ON clause raises an exception for version 23.3

```
select *
from (select [1,2,3] as arr) as t1
JOIN (select 1 as id) as t2
ON arrayMap(a -> a, t1.arr)[1] = t2.id
```

works fine at 22.8 and 23.8, but not for 23.3
