Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Non equivalent query rewrite:

```
milovidov-nix :) SELECT sum(x), count(x), avg(x) FROM (SELECT number::Decimal32(0) AS x FROM numbers(0)) SETTINGS optimize_syntax_fuse_functions = 1, optimize_fuse_sum_count_avg = 1

SELECT
    sum(x),
    count(x),
    avg(x)
FROM
(
    SELECT CAST(number, 'Decimal32(0)') AS x
    FROM numbers(0)
)
SETTINGS optimize_syntax_fuse_functions = 1, optimize_fuse_sum_count_avg = 1
