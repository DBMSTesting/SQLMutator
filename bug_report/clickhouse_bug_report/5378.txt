Title: enable_optimize_predicate_expression removed condition in subquery to MySQL table (19.6.2)
Description:
Fast query from mysql

```sql
SELECT
    date,
    countIf(status IN ('CP', 'A', 'OW', 'RC')) AS fact,
    count(*) AS fact
FROM
(
    SELECT
        toDateTime(floor(toRelativeSecondNum(OrderedDate) / 1200) * 1200) AS date,
        companyid,
        id,
        status
    FROM mysql('ip', 'csts', 'order', '', '')
    WHERE OrderedDate >= toString(toStartOfDay(now()))
)
WHERE companyid = 1
GROUP BY date

```
Different results, 19.5.3 - 2 seconds, 19.6.2 - 120 seconds.

Information from show full processlist mysql:

19.5.3:
```sql
SELECT
  companyid, status, OrderedDate
FROM csts.order
WHERE OrderedDate >= '2019-05-22 00:00:00'  
```

19.6.2
```sql
SELECT
   companyid, status, OrderedDate
FROM csts.order
WHERE (companyid = 1)

-- companyid condition was pushed down, but why OrderedDate condition disappeared?
```



if i use set enable_optimize_predicate_expression = 0 on 19.6.2 i will get result 2 seconds.
