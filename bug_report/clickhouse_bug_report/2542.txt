Title: Set Engine tables do not work with MergeTree tables
Description:
Steps to reproduce:

```
create table test_set (a UInt8) Engine = Set;
insert into test_set values (1);
select 1 in test_set; -- OK

create table test_mem (a UInt8) Engine = Memory;
insert into test_mem values (1),(2);
select * from test_mem where a in test_set; -- OK

create table test_merge (a UInt8, d Date default today()) Engine = MergeTree(d, (a), 8192);
insert into test_merge(a) values (1),(2);
select * from test_merge where a in test_set; -- NOT OK

Received exception from server (version 1.1.54385):
Code: 48. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: Method read is not supported by storage Set. 
```

Engines Log, TinyLog and Dictionary also work correctly with Set, only MergeTree does not. It can be fixed with subselect:

```select * from (select a from test_merge) where a in test_set;``` -- OK
