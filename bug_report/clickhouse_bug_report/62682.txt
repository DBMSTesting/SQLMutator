Title: "Not found column [..] in block" with clusterAllReplicas
Description:
This doesn't work:
```
:) select serverUUID() as s, sum(dummy) from clusterAllReplicas(both, system.one) group by s

[...]
Received exception from server (version 24.4.1):
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column serverUUID() in block. There are only columns: sum(__table1.dummy): While executing Remote. (NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK)
```

But this works:
```
:) select cityHash64(serverUUID()) + dummy as s, sum(dummy) from clusterAllReplicas(both, system.one) group by s

[...]

The cluster is just 2 servers running on localhost:
