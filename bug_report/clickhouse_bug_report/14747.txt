Title: system.parts duplicates result at 30 minutes of the hour
Description:
Querying the `rows` column of the `system.parts` table returns twice the amount at the full hour as well as 30 minutes of the hour.

E.g. `SELECT sum(rows) FROM system.parts WHERE active AND table IN (...);`

When executed at h.00 or h.30 it returns twice the amount as compared to times which are not the full hour or 30 minutes of the hour.
