Description:

### Describe what's wrong

There's a problem with the lock files for a backup on a local filesystem. Lock file contains UUID of a backup, and sometimes it's possible to get into a situation when the backup lock file contents are being read from the FS cache with an old UUID. A bit more details:

1. Try to create a backup, a lock file is created with some UUID value
2. Backup creation fails for some reason
3. All files are being removed, including the lock file
4. Create a backup in the same directory
5. A new lock file is created with a new UUID
6. At some point a check is being performed that the lock file exists, but a lock file with old UUID is taken from the FS cache, and this UUID doesn't match a new one. As a result, the backup creation fails with an error "concurrent backup is running"

### Does it reproduce on the most recent release?

Yes

### How to reproduce

I got into this error with a flaky check of this [test](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/72a8744efa5f501facdeea3a94b3619bc48fade1/tests/queries/0_stateless/03315_query_log_privileges_backup_restore.sh). To reproduce the problem, it's enough to remove `system drop mmap cache` query from the test and run it multiple times in parallel (50 times with 8 jobs worked in my case): https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/72a8744efa5f501facdeea3a94b3619bc48fade1/tests/queries/0_stateless/03315_query_log_privileges_backup_restore.sh#L26-L28
