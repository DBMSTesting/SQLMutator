Title:  Mutation "alter table .. delete" completes successfully without deleting data
Description:
Hello, I have a problem with the mutations. There is a replicated table with 5.5 million old rows. I want to remove them on one of the replicas using mutations: 
`alter table database.statistics delete where provider_id = 301 and channel_id = 0 and date> = '2016-07-01' and date <'2016-08-01'; `
I get an answer 
`0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.058 sec. `
But at the same time, count() shows 5.5 million rows for the same request conditions. This query is added to the mutation table, where it is marked as completed (`is_done = 1; parts_to_do = 0`). The `block_numbers.partition_id` field is not empty (actually, there is a list of ~70 partitions), as I can understand something has to be executed, but all these records still exist. 
Of course, I tried to ask for advice in the "Кликхаус не тормозит" community, but we could not find the any reasons for this problem. And there were other users (on the different CH versions) who faced the same problem so that this might be a bug.
How can I figure out the reasons for this?

CH version: 20.3.19.4
database.statistics is large ReplicatedCollapsingMergeTree table contains mostly integer values.
Thank you :)
