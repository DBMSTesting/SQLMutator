Title: ClickHouse docker containers unable to verify certificates
Description:
ClickHouse Docker images are missing package(s) required to validate certificates.  As a result,  Kafka table engine and the url() table function cannot use encrypted connections.  This also affects Kubernetes installations that use community-built Docker images. The behavior has been verified on 19.16.17.80 and 20.3.8.53.

Version 19.16.17.80 fails with the following error:

```
The same query on version 20.3.8.53 fails with a different error:
```
Received exception from server (version 20.3.8):
Code: 1000. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: SSL Exception: error:02000002:system library::No such file or directory. 
```

The steps to reproduce on Ubuntu 18.04 with Docker CE 19.03.4 are shown below.  Start the image and exec in to run the test query.  Your image ID will vary. 
```
$ docker run -d yandex/clickhouse-server:19.16.17.80

Expected behavior is to connect to the site and download values. 

You can solve this problem in the container by installing the ca-certificates dpgk.  Here are the commands:
```
apt update
apt install ca-certificates
```
At this point the query can connect to the remote source and shows a table.
