Title: Error in query execution
Description:
**Query1**: """select toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(transactiondate)) as transactiondate,SUM(debitamountinaccountingcurrency) as sum from callhealth.callhealth_financialledger GROUP BY toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(transactiondate))"""

**Query2**: """select toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(transactiondate)) as transactiondate,SUM(debitamountinaccountingcurrency) as sum from callhealth.callhealth_financialledger GROUP BY toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(transactiondate)) as transactiondate"""

**Query1** is giving following error, where as **Query2** is working fine. Both queries are technically same. In clickhouse only I'm facing this issue with Query1.

giving error as follows:
"""Code: 215. DB::Exception: Column `transactiondate` is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY. Have columns: ['sum(debitamountinaccountingcurrency)','toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(transactiondate))))']: While processing toStartOfQuarter(toDateTime(transactiondate)), sum(debitamountinaccountingcurrency). (NOT_AN_AGGREGATE) (version 23.2.1.2151 (official build))"""
