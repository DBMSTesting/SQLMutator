Title: WITH fails to alias if function not supplied
Description:
When trying to use a WITH function to provide a simple alias, it fails if I don't wrap it in a function of some kind.

### fails without a function
```
WITH name AS myName
SELECT 
  myName
FROM system.functions
```

### works with a function applied
```
WITH toString(name) AS myName
SELECT 
  myName
FROM system.functions
```

My use case is that I have complex queries where I substitute specific columns / calculated aliases based on user input. It is much easier to hardcode the queries based on an alias defined in a WITH column, even if sometimes there is no function to be executed.
