**How to reproduce**
* Clickhouse 20.11.3.3

**Step**
1. Create Kafka Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS olap_kafka_transform_local ON CLUSTER ck_cluster_1
(
    `id` String,
    `dt` String,
    `cc_level1` String,
    `cc_level2` String,
    `cc_level3` String,
    `app_id` UInt32
) ENGINE = Kafka
    SETTINGS
    kafka_broker_list = 'xxxxxxx',
    kafka_topic_list = 'olap_consume_offline',
    kafka_group_name = 'olap_consume_offline_ck_cluster_1',
    kafka_format = 'JSONEachRow',
    kafka_num_consumers = 6,
    kafka_max_block_size = 20000,
    kafka_skip_broken_messages = 1048577;;
```

2. delete kafka engine table

```sql
drop table olap_kafka_transform_local ON CLUSTER ck_cluster_1;
```
