```sql
create table merge (url String, mergedUrls Array(String)) engine = Memory;
insert into merge values ('a', ['b', 'c']);

with input as (
    select distinct on (d.url) d.url as cluster_name from merge d order by d.url desc limit 100
),
    cluster_url_q1 as (
        select distinct on (d.url) d.url as cluster_name, d.mergedUrls as url
        from merge d
        where d.url in input
        order by d.url
    ),
    cluster_url_t as (
        select distinct on (cluster_name, url) cluster_name, url
        from cluster_url_q1
        array join url
    ),
    (select groupArray((cluster_name, url)) from cluster_url_t) as cluster_url_a
select cluster_url_a, groupArray((cluster_name, url)) from cluster_url_t
settings enable_analyzer=1;
```

after another attempt to turn on the analyzer in one of the queries, the array join stopped working.
expected `[('a','b'),('a','c')]` got `[('a',['b','c'])]`
