Title: Can't export data from mssql over mssql odbc driver with a long time query.
Description:
`insert into select `process drops, when select process takes more than 250 s.
300 thousand rows exported seamlessly, but when it's 8 million and time of collecting rows takes a little longer, connection breaks after some time waiting, with this reject `Code: 159, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Timeout exceeded: elapsed 100.104694572 seconds, maximum: 5 (version 20.3.8.53)`. 
select which I trying to complete.
```
insert into default.orders_history
(ClassCode,TradeDate,ClientCode,SecCode,Operation, Price,Value)
SELECT ClassCode,TradeDate,ClientCode,SecCode,Operation, Price,Value
FROM odbc('DSN=QExport;Uid=xxx;Pwd=xxx;BatchSize=10000000;Timeout=0', 'dbo', 'Orders')
```
