Title: LEFT JOIN with trivial join condition (e.g. `1=1`) produces incorrect result
Description:


**Describe what's wrong**


When I use a LEFT JOIN, ClickHouse does not return the table being joined correctly.

I constructed an empty table `t0` and a table `t1` with one row of data. When `t1` is left-joined with `t0`, the row from `t1` should be retained. As mentioned in the [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/join): "LEFT OUTER JOIN, non-matching rows from the left table are returned in addition to matching rows."

However, ClickHouse actually returns empty values.
**How to reproduce**
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0; 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1; 



CREATE TABLE t0 (
    c0 Int32 DEFAULT 0, 
    c1 Int32
) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY c0; 

CREATE TABLE t1 (
    c0 Int32
) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY c0;

INSERT INTO t1 (c0) VALUES (0);



SELECT *
FROM t1
LEFT JOIN t0 ON 1=1 ;
```



**Expected behavior**


One row of results should be returned.
