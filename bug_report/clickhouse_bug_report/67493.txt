Title: LEFT SEMI JOIN doesn't work with tuple(NULL) = tuple(NULL)
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Difference in behavior with new analyzer + SEMI JOIN + tuple(NULL) = tuple(NULL)

```
SELECT '============WRONG';

SELECT a.key FROM (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as a LEFT SEMI JOIN (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as b ON tuple(a.key) = tuple(b.key) SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer=1;

┌─key─┐
│ 1   │
└─────┘

SELECT '============CORRECT WITH IS NOT DISTINCT FROM';

SELECT a.key FROM (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as a LEFT SEMI JOIN (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as b ON a.key IS NOT DISTINCT FROM b.key  SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer=1;

┌─key──┐
│ ᴺᵁᴸᴸ │
└──────┘
┌─key─┐
│ 1   │
└─────┘

SELECT '============CORRECT WITHOUT ANALYZER';
SELECT a.key FROM (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as a LEFT SEMI JOIN (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as b ON tuple(a.key) = tuple(b.key) SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer=0;

┌─key──┐
│ ᴺᵁᴸᴸ │
└──────┘
┌─key─┐
│ 1   │
└─────┘

SELECT '============CORRECT WITH LEFT ANY JOIN';
SELECT a.key FROM (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as a LEFT ANY JOIN (SELECT NULL AS key UNION ALL SELECT '1' as key) as b ON tuple(a.key) = tuple(b.key) SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer=1;

┌─key──┐
│ ᴺᵁᴸᴸ │

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

@vdimir, do you have any idea? AFAIK behavior should match as isNotDistinctFrom is implemented via tuples
