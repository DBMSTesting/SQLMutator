Title: Windows: Clickhouse Fails on start with Poco::FileAccessDeniedException Error
Description:

I'm trying to run Clickhouse on Ubuntu terminal on Windows 10. After reinstallation Clickhouse  fails to start with the tracelog:
Include not found: clickhouse_remote_servers
Include not found: clickhouse_compression
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Poco::FileAccessDeniedException'
terminate called recursively
Aborted (core dumped)
I've tried to change the permession for clickhouse folders but it didn't help.

When running sudo clickhouse-server --config-file=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml it gives the following error:
