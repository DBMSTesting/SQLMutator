Title: Inserts queries stack between Distributed and MergeTree tables
Description:
ClickHouse version is 20.3.8.53

`CREATE TABLE local.a (
 t DateTime,
 tm Date MATERIALIZED toDate(t)
) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree() ;`

`CREATE TABLE write.a (
  t DateTime,
  tm Date
) ENGINE = Distributed(cluster, local, a);`

I send inserts in the table `write.a` with both field `t` and `tm` and now data hangs. ClickHouse trying to send it to the table `local.a`, but field `tm` rises error  `Cannot insert column tm, because it is MATERIALIZED column`.
I try system queries `STOP DISTRIBUTED SENDS write.a`, but its doesn't work for me - I need to delete this queries.
Trying to reboot ClickHouse - does not work.
Has anyone got any ideas how to fix it?
Thanks in advance.
