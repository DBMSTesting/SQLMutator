unexpected `Division by zero`

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
19.17.4.11
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```sql
CREATE TABLE test (`i` Int64, `d` Decimal(38, 6)) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY tuple() SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192 ;`
insert into test values (0,4.9);
select case when i>0 then d/i else 0 end from test;
```

the result should be `0`

The result is correct if `d` is Float64
