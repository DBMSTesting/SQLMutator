Title: Error when join more than 1 table to a table that has a Nested column type
Description:
There is a table with a Nested column type.
When I do a select from this table on specific columns (for example, select t1.arr.value1), the join option works for only one table, or it is necessary to select all columns (for example, select t1.*).
With join more then 2 tables with the main table and select on specific columns, it gives an error "There's no column...".
Version 23.5.4.25 (latest now) and lower.
