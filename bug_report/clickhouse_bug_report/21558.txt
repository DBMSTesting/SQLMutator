Title: ARRAY JOIN query using IN on an array field with a bloomfilter throws an exception.
Description:
**Describe the bug**

Performing a query using `ARRAY JOIN` and `IN` on an array field using a bloomfilter throws an exception. As queries using the function `has` work I suppose this type of query should/could also work?

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Tested on v21.2.5.5-stable (2021-03-02).

**How to reproduce**

Test table:

```
CREATE TABLE test (
    id UInt16, 
    ts DateTime,
    data Array(String),
    INDEX test_bloom data TYPE bloom_filter GRANULARITY 1
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(ts)
ORDER BY id;

INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, '2021-01-01', ['aaa','bbb']);
INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, '2021-01-01', ['ccc']);
```

This query works as intended: `SELECT id FROM test WHERE has(data, 'ccc');`.

The query `SELECT id FROM test ARRAY JOIN data WHERE data IN ('aaa');` throws the exception **Code: 130. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Array does not start with '[' character.**.
