Title: Corrupted data in system.columns
Description:
1.1.54292
I issued a 'detach partition' query without knowing that a merge on that partition was running at that time.
My query waited for the merge to finish and then completed successfully.
Later I noticed error messages like this in log files:
`<Error> <table_name> (Data): Possibly incorrect subtraction: 7621 - 170117 = 18446744073709389120, variable <column_name>.bin.file_size`
It turned out that the data in system.columns was corrupted for this table.
All three columns with data sizes contained huge numbers for all table columns (like 18446744073709389120).
I detached the table and attached it back.
