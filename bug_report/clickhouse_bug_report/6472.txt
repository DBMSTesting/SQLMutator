Title: Checksums of parts don't match after update to 19.13 from 19.9
Description:
I added 2 servers to cluster where all machines were on 19.9 and installed 19.13 there.

First, there appears to be a lot of such messages in the log of 19.9 machines:

2019.08.13 14:46:24.793856 [ 11 ] {} <Error> ethereum.transfers_flow_from: Code: 40, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Checksums of parts don't match: hash of uncompressed files doesn't match (version 19.9.2.4 (official build)). Data after merge is not byte-identical to data on another replicas. There could be several reasons: 1. Using newer version of compression library after server update. 2. Using another compression method. 3. Non-deterministic compression algorithm (highly unlikely). 4. Non-deterministic merge algorithm due to logical error in code. 5. Data corruption in memory due to bug in code. 6. Data corruption in memory due to hardware issue. 7. Manual modification of source data after server startup. 8. Manual modification of checksums stored in ZooKeeper. We will download merged part from replica to force byte-identical result.


Second, the ALTER TABLE DELETE WHERE failed on this cluster with messages as

<Error> ethereum.transfers_flow_to: DB::StorageReplicatedMergeTree::queueTask()::<lambda(DB::StorageReplicatedMergeTree::LogEntryPtr&)>: Code: 226, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Marks file '/var/lib/clickhouse/data/ethereum/transfers_flow_to/tmp_fetch_all_39936_43139_14/block.mrk' doesn't exist
