Title: Certain value are not deleted, immediately
Description:
Table defined as
```
CREATE TABLE rt_analytics.transactions ( 
	id Int64,
	timestamp UInt32, 
/** omissis */
ENGINE = MergeTree(date, timestamp, 8192)

SELECT 
    max(timestamp), 
    toDateTime(max(timestamp))
FROM transactions 

┌─max(timestamp)─┬─toDateTime(max(timestamp))─┐
│     1509565623 │        2017-11-01 19:47:03 │

ALTER TABLE rt_analytics.transactions
DROP PARTITION 201711

┌─max(timestamp)─┬─toDateTime(max(timestamp))─┐
│     1509496216 │        2017-11-01 00:30:16 │

```

I also deleted October, but, there is still this single row, 

While opening this bug, I executed the select again, and now it was flushed...

I'll just leave there, maybe some bell rings.

Bye
