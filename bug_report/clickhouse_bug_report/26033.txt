Title: clickhouse-client systematically killed by oom
Description:
ClickHouse client version 21.5.5.12 is systematically killed when I execute any command. 

System details: debian buster with 16G RAM
Clickhouse server version: 21.5.5 revision 54448

Bug:
root@debian:~# clickhouse-client --ask-password

Killed
root@debian:~# 

dmesg log:
[ts] Out of memory: Kill process 23121 (clickhouse-clie) score 799 or sacrifice child
[ts] Killed process 23121 (clickhouse-clie) total-vm:26893548kB, anon-rss:14503432kB, file-rss:44304kB, shmem-rss:0kB
[ts] oom_reaper: reaped process 23121 (clickhouse-clie), now anon-rss:0kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB


The server is running fine and has not at any point suffered been stopped. 

I've looked up similar issues faced by users and they are all related to the clickhouse server not the client. 
This also means that nothing meaningful is logged when the client is killed.
