Title: Invalid Parquet Files written by Clickhouse with DateTime64(9)
Description:
### Company or project name

_No response_

### Describe what's wrong

According to the guys at polars the parquet files written by clickhouse are written in a slightly invalid way, specifically the datetime column, https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/20628 see this comment in particular: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/20628#issuecomment-2586504867, all that is required to reproduce is to write a table with that column, although polars can now read it, you have to actually look into the parquet file metadata to see the issue

### Does it reproduce on the most recent release?

Yes

### How to reproduce

I don't know how to inspect the matadata of the files to actually show this invalid utf8, but simply writing any table with a DateTime64(9) column is sufficient to produce a parquet file that polars complains about

### Expected behavior
