Title: How to add nodes to existing standalone keeper instance?
Description:
Current I have a standalone keeper instance at 192.168.1.1 and I want to add 2 additional nodes (192.168.2.1 & 192.168.3.1) to the cluster. I changed the `raft_configuration` in xml file, adding 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.3.1 to it. The `raft_configuration` on the other nodes also contains 3 entries.

When I started the 3 nodes. the new nodes don't join the existing node with logs like 
```
2023.07.19 06:27:12.306425 [ 238 ] {} <Information> RaftInstance: [PRE-VOTE INIT] my id 2, my role candidate, term 22, log idx 0, log term 0, priority (target 1 / mine 1)
2023.07.19 06:27:12.308256 [ 237 ] {} <Information> RaftInstance: [PRE-VOTE RESP] peer 1 (X), term 22, resp term 22, my role candidate, dead 1, live 0, abandoned 1, num voting members 2, quorum 2
```

What should I do?
