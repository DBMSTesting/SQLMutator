Title: PostgreSQL engine: pqxx, new command started while previous is active
Description:
**(you don't have to strictly follow this form)**

steps to reproduce:

1.
```
create table pg_table (
     ....
) engine PostgreSQL(...connection_settings...)
```
2. setup the same table on PostgreSQL 13+
3. run any benchmark using HTTP (reproduced with 7 concurrent loader processes ~ 900+ rps): 
```
select * from pg_table where f1 = v1 and f2 = v2 and f3 = v3 and f4 like v4 and f5 like v5 limit 100;
```

**result:**

getting unpredictable exception rate: 
`started new command  'someStatement' while command 'someStatement' was still active.`

maybe some related pqxx issue:

**environment:**

running CH in Docker

**version:**

20.12.7.3

**additional information**

using random session id for every http request reduce exception rate
