Title: Bad links in the "Ontime" tutorial
Description:
** Update **

After I cloned this repo I found the Markdown has already been updated by #4545 but the website is not yet.

Please rebuild the website to reflect latest changes.

~~**Describe the bug**~~

~~The raw data links on the *Ontime* tutorial (https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/getting_started/example_datasets/ontime/) have been moved, the script will get 404~~

~~**How to reproduce**~~

~~run script on the page~~

```bash
for s in `seq 1987 2017`
do
for m in `seq 1 12`
do
wget http://transtats.bts.gov/PREZIP/On_Time_On_Time_Performance_${s}_${m}.zip
done
done
```

~~or single liner~~
```bash
for s in {1987..2017}; do for m in {1..12}; do wget "http://transtats.bts.gov/PREZIP/On_Time_On_Time_Performance_${s}_${m}.zip"; done; done
```

~~**Expected behavior**~~

~~Data files get downloaded~~

~~**Error message and/or stacktrace**~~

~~** Context **~~

~~The links format changed from 
`http://transtats.bts.gov/PREZIP/On_Time_On_Time_Performance_1987_10.zip`
to 
`https://transtats.bts.gov/PREZIP/On_Time_Reporting_Carrier_On_Time_Performance_1987_present_1987_10.zip`~~

~~And only Oct, Nov and Dec of the year 1987 have valid data files.~~
