**Expected behavior**
Moving parts as less as possible according to the storage policy.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
There are about 50.25GB parts need to be moved from hdd1 to hdd2 according to my manual calculation. However more parts have been moved.
The following log indicates that the first movePartsTask selected 50.25GB which matches my calculation. However later movePartsTask (invoked by other background threads) selected more parts to move.
A fix would be preventing accessing disk (from where moving parts) from concurrent movePartsTask.
