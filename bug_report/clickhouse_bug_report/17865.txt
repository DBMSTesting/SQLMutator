Title: set index is broken 
Description:
when I run this sql, it is not ok:
```
SELECT
    formatDateTime(TS_T_1_.dt, '%Y%m%d') AS T_0_2_,
    sum(room_act_duration) AS T_1_3_,
    countDistinct(room_id) AS T_2_4_,
    countDistinct(if(room_is_exposed = 1, room_id, NULL)) AS T_3_5_
FROM
(
    SELECT
        dt,
        room_id,
        multiIf(room_property = 'business', '商业房', room_property = 'fleet', '家族房', '个人房') AS room_property,
        room_channel,
        room_is_exposed,
        arraySum(groupArray(duration)) + arraySum(arrayFilter(x -> (x < 0), arrayDifference(arrayFlatten(arraySort(x -> (x[1]), groupArray([start_time, end_time])))))) AS room_act_duration
    FROM dws_oversea.ads_anu_onmic_user_room_di_dis
    WHERE (channel_name IN ('af_Social_facebook', 'af_asm_440644258')) AND (multiIf(gender = 1, '男', gender = 2, '女', '未知') IN ('未知', '男')) AND ('BI' = 'BI') AND ('BI' = 'BI') AND ('BI' = 'BI')
    GROUP BY
        dt,
        room_id,
        room_property,
        room_channel,
        room_is_exposed
) AS TS_T_1_
GROUP BY formatDateTime(TS_T_1_.dt, '%Y%m%d')
LIMIT 1000

Received exception from server (version 20.3.10):
Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from xxxx.xxxx.com:3306. DB::Exception: ColumnUInt8 expected as Set index condition result..
```

but when I remove all the condition that return true(always return true), and it is ok:
```
SELECT
    formatDateTime(TS_T_1_.dt, '%Y%m%d') AS T_0_2_,
    sum(room_act_duration) AS T_1_3_,
    countDistinct(room_id) AS T_2_4_,
    countDistinct(if(room_is_exposed = 1, room_id, NULL)) AS T_3_5_
FROM
(
    SELECT
        dt,
        room_id,
        multiIf(room_property = 'business', '商业房', room_property = 'fleet', '家族房', '个人房') AS room_property,
        room_channel,
        room_is_exposed,
        arraySum(groupArray(duration)) + arraySum(arrayFilter(x -> (x < 0), arrayDifference(arrayFlatten(arraySort(x -> (x[1]), groupArray([start_time, end_time])))))) AS room_act_duration
    FROM dws_oversea.ads_anu_onmic_user_room_di_dis
    WHERE (channel_name IN ('af_Social_facebook', 'af_asm_440644258')) AND (multiIf(gender = 1, '男', gender = 2, '女', '未知') IN ('未知', '男'))
    GROUP BY
        dt,
        room_id,
        room_property,
        room_channel,
        room_is_exposed
) AS TS_T_1_
GROUP BY formatDateTime(TS_T_1_.dt, '%Y%m%d')
LIMIT 1000

this makes me confused~~  when set index condition used with `and 1 = 1 ` it is broken.
