Title: RBAC - EXISTS <dictionary> requires SHOW TABLES.
Description:
**Describe the bug**
The grant `SHOW DICTIONARIES ON dict0` does not allow the user to execute `EXISTS dict0`, as [documentation](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant/#grant-show) says it should. Instead the user needs `SHOW TABLES ON dict0`.

**How to reproduce**
* ClickHouse server version 20.10.3 revision 54441.
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
altinity-qa-cosmic2 :) GRANT SHOW DICTIONARIES ON *.* TO user0

GRANT SHOW DICTIONARIES ON *.* TO user0

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec.

Bye.
myrotk@altinity-qa-cosmic2:~$ clickhouse client -uuser0
ClickHouse client version 20.10.3.30 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user user0.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 20.10.3 revision 54441.

altinity-qa-cosmic2 :) EXISTS dict0

EXISTS TABLE dict0

Received exception from server (version 20.10.3):
Code: 497. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: user0: Not enough privileges. To execute this query it's necessary to have the grant SHOW TABLES ON default.dict0.
