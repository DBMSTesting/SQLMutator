Title: Crash on BigDecimal 128 operations
Description:

ClickHouse client version 19.9.2.4 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 19.9.2 revision 54421.


Crash on request like:
```
SELECT
    formatDateTime(tx_date, '%Y-%m') AS `_aq.date.date`,
    median( transfers_currency.value)
FROM transfers_currency
WHERE transfers_currency.currency_id = 408185
GROUP BY `_aq.date.date`
ORDER BY `_aq.date.date` ASC
```

where
transfers_currency.value is value Decimal128(0)

The following request works OK:

```
SELECT
    formatDateTime(tx_date, '%Y-%m') AS `_aq.date.date`,
    median( toFloat64(transfers_currency.value))
FROM transfers_currency
WHERE transfers_currency.currency_id = 408185
GROUP BY `_aq.date.date`
ORDER BY `_aq.date.date` ASC
```
