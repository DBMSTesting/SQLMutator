Title: Broken multi-line paste in clickhouse-client
Description:
I paste multiple lines with queries into clickhouse-client, each on its line:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS userid_test;

SET use_index_for_in_with_subqueries = 1;
```

I expect them to run one after another -- it worked this way at least in 19.15, it works this way in bash, psql, etc.

What I get instead:

```
:) DROP TABLE IF EXISTS userid_test;

SET use_index_for_in_with_subqueries = 1;

Syntax error (Multi-statements are not allowed): failed at position 33 (end of query) (line 1, col 33):
