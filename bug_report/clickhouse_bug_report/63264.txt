Title: UNKNOWN_AGGREGATED_DATA_VARIANT with constant GROUP BY and remote queries
Description:
The `02967_analyzer_fuzz` is broken in master and it was introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63047

A simple reproducer shows it:
```
SELECT count()
FROM remote(test_cluster_two_shards, system, one)
GROUP BY 'hi'
SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 1, group_by_two_level_threshold = 1, group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes = 33950592
```

```
DB::Exception: Unknown aggregated data variant.: While executing GroupingAggregatedTransform. (UNKNOWN_AGGREGATED_DATA_VARIANT)
```

Does not happen in the old interpreter, and it requires triggering `group_by_two_level_threshold`
