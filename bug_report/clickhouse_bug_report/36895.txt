Title: Exception "Column is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY" do not raise as expected
Description:
ClickHouse version 22.3.3.44

I made script with obvious error in last string:
```
select a, max(b) max_b, min(b) min_b from      
(      
	select 1 as a, 10 as b
	union all
	select 1 as a, 20 as b
	union all
	select 1 as a, 30 as b
)
group by a
having b = 10 or max(b) = 30 
```
ClickHouse throw an exception  "Code: 215. DB::Exception: Column `b` is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY..."

But there is no exception, when i write just 'having b = 10' in last string:
```
select a, max(b) max_b, min(b) min_b from      
(      
	select 1 as a, 10 as b
	union all
	select 1 as a, 20 as b
	union all
	select 1 as a, 30 as b
)
group by a
having b = 10
``` 
ClickHouse processed this like `WHERE b = 10`
I think this is bug - plain column 'b', without any aggregate function, should not be accessible in HAVING statement.
