Title: toWeek and toYearWeek do not return the same week
Description:
**Describe the bug**
For 2000-01-01, mode 0, toWeek says it is week 0, toYearWeek says it is week 52.
Reading the [documentation for toYearWeek](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions/#toyearweekdatemode) it says:
> The mode argument works exactly like the mode argument to toWeek()
Which is why I would expect both functions to return the same result.

**How to reproduce**
```bash
docker run -d --name ch20.10 --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 -p 8125:8123 yandex/clickhouse-server:20.10.3.30
curl -s "http://localhost:8125/" -d "SELECT toWeek(toDate('2000-01-01'), 0), toYearWeek(toDate('2000-01-01'), 0)"
docker stop ch20.10
```
Result: `0	199952`

**Expected behavior**
Result: `52	199952`
