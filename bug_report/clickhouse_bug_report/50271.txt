Title: Trigger INVALID_JOIN_ON_EXPRESSION while the SQL does not use ON clause
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

The SELECT statement should output results normally, but it threw an exception.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

It can be reproduced in the latest version.

**How to reproduce**

Version: 23.5.1.1 (commit 3e6314675c6467bc4dd78f659bac862f7e9648f8)

Easy reproduce in ClickHouse fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/7f382e0b-739e-4719-b45e-9596d2a1d1ed

_Set up database_

```sql
create table t1 (c3 String, primary key(c3))engine = MergeTree;
create table t2 (c11 String, primary key(c11))engine = MergeTree;
insert into t1 values ('succeed');
insert into t2 values ('succeed');
```

_Bug-triggering query_

```sql
select 
    ref_0.c11 as c_2_c30_0
  from 
    t2 as ref_0
      cross join (select 
            ref_1.c3 as c_6_c28_15 
          from 
            t1 as ref_1
       ) as subq_0
  where subq_0.c_6_c28_15 = (select c11 from t2 order by c11 limit 1);
```

**Expected behavior**

The SELECT statement is executed without any error.

**Actual behavior**

It throws an exception:
```
Received exception from server (version 23.4.2):
Code: 403. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot get JOIN keys from JOIN ON section: 'c_6_c28_15 = (_CAST('succeed', 'Nullable(String)') AS _subquery1)', found keys: [Left keys: [] Right keys [] Condition columns: '', 'equals(c_6_c28_15, _subquery1)']. (INVALID_JOIN_ON_EXPRESSION)
(query: select 
    ref_0.c11 as c_2_c30_0
  from 
    t2 as ref_0
      cross join (select 
            ref_1.c3 as c_6_c28_15 
          from 
            t1 as ref_1
       ) as subq_0
  where subq_0.c_6_c28_15 = (select c11 from t2 order by c11 limit 1);)
```

**Additional context**

The earliest reproducible version is 21 in fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/66a6a811-1bd9-4071-a708-79fb73b61fb3

Before version 21, the query can be executed without any error (e.g. no error in 20.12.8.5-alpine, https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/bb4eb9ef-58cf-4abb-900d-6bcc2bacb52d). It outputs one row:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ [1mc_2_c30_0[0m ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ succeed   │
└───────────┘
```
