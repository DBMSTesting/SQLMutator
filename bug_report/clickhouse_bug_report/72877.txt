Title: formatDateTime %z bug: extra random crufty characters instead of +
Description:
**Company or project name**

Cribl

**Describe what's wrong**

When using `formatDateTime()` with a format that contains `%z` mixed with other placeholders, you get extra random crufty characters instead of `+`.

Easily reproduced:

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

**How to reproduce**

See Fiddle link above.  Use `%z` in comination with pretty much any other format placeholder such as `%W`, i.e. 

```formatDateTime(ts, '%W%z')```

Doesn't matter which version/interface/settings.

**Expected behavior**

`%z` should yield `+0000` consistently with no random/crufty characters.
