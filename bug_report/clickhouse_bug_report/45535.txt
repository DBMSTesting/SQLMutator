Title: UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER error on simple query with window function and expression in ORDER BY
Description:
Hello, we found a bug after updating to latest Clickhouse version (22.12.3.5). Here is a minimal reprodicible example:

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  count() OVER () AS c
FROM numbers(10)
ORDER BY toString(number)
```
```
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Unknown column: toString(number), there are only columns number. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER) (version 22.12.3.5 (official build))
```

Or
```sql
WITH
  toString(number) as str
SELECT
  *,
  count() OVER () AS c
FROM numbers(10)
ORDER BY str
```
```
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Unknown column: str, there are only columns number. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER) (version 22.12.3.5 (official build))
```

Both queries worked fine in Clickhouse 22.8, but aren't working in 22.9-22.12. Possibly related to https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/23194.

Workarounds:
* Move sorting column to SELECT
```sql
SELECT
  *,
  count() OVER () AS c,
  toString(number) as str
FROM numbers(10)
ORDER BY str
```
* Move initial query to WITH section:
```sql
WITH
  test AS (
    SELECT
      *,
      count() OVER () AS c
    FROM numbers(10)
  )
SELECT * FROM test
ORDER BY toString(number)
```
