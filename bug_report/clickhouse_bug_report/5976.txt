Title: Specifying JOIN ON-clause without table names in any order of equation sides
Description:
Consider the following execution: https://pastebin.com/ADkjqE32

Issue here is that I should mention equation sides in ON-clause in specific order: a = c, but not c = a. I believe that the initial intention here was to motivate user specifying table names before column names: if I write t2.c = t1.a, it works perfectly. 

As for me, there are some things that may be done better here:

1. Error message may at least mention which table lacks specified columns.
2. When column tables may be deduced unambiguously, it should be OK to use such columns in any side of the equation (this is the case for the listing above).
3. Anyway, such behavior should be well-documented somewhere around the description of JOIN-section.
