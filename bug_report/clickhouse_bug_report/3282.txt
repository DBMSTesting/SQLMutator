Title: [Question] Decimal type in SummingMergeTree
Description:
Hello. 

I tried to use decimal type in SummingMergeTree table (decimal column under aggregation). Insert and select queries works fine, but when I try to use OPTIMIZE TABLE statement for collapsing rows in the table I get next error: 
`DB::Exception: Method get64 is not supported for Decimal64`
I know that the decimal type is currently experimental, so that error is a bug, is it in development or maybe decimal type will not work with the SummingMergeTree type (clickhouse server version 18.12.17)?

Thanks in advance for the help.
