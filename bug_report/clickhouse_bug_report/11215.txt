Title: WHERE 1 or WHERE 1=1 causes bugs when using GLOBAL JOIN
Description:
**Describe the bug**
I use **GLOBAL ANY LEFT JOIN** to join metadata table with fact table.
When I use **WHERE 1=1** to add additional conditions with **AND...** then it return nothings when left join with metadata table

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: **19.17**
* Which interface to use, if matters: **DataGrip**
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result`

```
