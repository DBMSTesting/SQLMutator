Title: Kafka storage's shutdown hangs if no messages are ever fetched
Description:
Using ClickHouse 19.8.3.8 on Debian 9 on WSL, installed from Yandex repository. The problem also appeared on version 19.7.5.27.
Queries were executed in ClickHouse CLI.

Test table is created with this query:
```
CREATE TABLE kafka_test2 (
    timestamp UInt64,
    assetId String,
    dimension1 Nullable(String),
    dimension2 Nullable(String),
    dimension3 Nullable(String),
    dimension4 Nullable(String),
    dimension5 Nullable(String),
    metric1 Nullable(Float64)
  ) ENGINE = Kafka('localhost:9092', 'test_metrics', 'test-ch-group-100', 'JSONEachRow');
```
Table name `kafka_test2` is unique and was never used, as well as consumer group `test-ch-group-100`.

Trace log:
```

```

Then I run DROP TABLE. Messages from CLI:
```
Darkrai.localdomain :) DROP TABLE kafka_test2;

DROP TABLE kafka_test2

Timeout exceeded while receiving data from server. Waited for 300 seconds, timeout is 300 seconds.
Cancelling query.
```
It hangs on cancelling.

In server log only one message:
```
2019.06.14 13:20:59.621685 [ 49 ] {ff0392c1-0ac8-4dff-94fe-f179e8853d6f} <Debug> executeQuery: (from 127.0.0.1:34618) DROP TABLE kafka_test2;
```

After stopping the server in linux console it hangs on:
```
v1rusw0rm@Darkrai:~$ sudo service clickhouse-server stop
Stop clickhouse-server service:
```

And server log:
```
2019.06.14 13:43:29.699305 [ 50 ] {} <Information> Application: Received termination signal (Terminated)
2019.06.14 13:43:29.699892 [ 1 ] {} <Debug> Application: Received termination signal.

2019.06.14 13:43:55.987254 [ 1 ] {} <Information> Application: Shutting down storages.
```

Server's error log is clean.
