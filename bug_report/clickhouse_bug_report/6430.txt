Title: Kafka stream to multiple destination tables via Chained View (Regression) 
Description:
**Describe the bug**
tableB (second table from KafkaEngine does not get filled with data)

**How to reproduce**
We created chain as:

```
kafkaEngine -> mv stream A -> tableAraw-MergeTree 
                           -> mv stream B -> tableB_sum1h-SummingMergeTree
```

as per 					 
https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/2174
https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/4587
					 
This used to work in 19.8.3.8 (the last kafka version we use), but we have problem that table B remains empty using 19.13.1.1020-testing. Table A gets filled with data.

**Expected behavior**
TableB should have data
