Title: Insert queries stopped for max_concurrent_queries don't clear
Description:
ClickHouse version 21.8.3

Since we upgraded from 21.4.4 we've seen insert queries get hung up at least three different times.  The behavior each time was similar -- INSERTs would begin fail with the exception `Too many simultaneous queries. Maximum: 64 (version 21.8.3.44`.  A few additional inserts also failed with zookeeper timeouts, so zookeeper connectivity could also be a factor.

Other "read" queries were also happening at the time, as we usually only have at most a dozen or so simultaneous INSERTs.  So the original error is probably correct.

The issue is the insert processes/queries remain in the queue.  Even after 10+ minutes the first "failed" insert was still in the system.processes table.  It seems like there is some combination of circumstances that is not cleaning up these failed inserts, and eventually all 64 query "slots" are filled with failed inserts, and all subsequent INSERT queries fail with the the "too many simultaneous queries" exception.  The system.processes table contains 64 insert queries.

 I'll try to capture more data next time it happens, but so far we've just restarted ClickHouse (on our production machines) to get our writes working again.
