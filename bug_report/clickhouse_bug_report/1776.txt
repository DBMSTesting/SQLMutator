Title: (Replicated)SummingMergeTree is making very strange things with Enum columns which are not a part of PK
Description:
This is a guess based on two things.
1) We are sending ad views and clicks to ClickHouse. Logging on the sending end shows that there are a lot of views and handful of clicks. Each event is 1 row in CH, with column `event_type = Enum8('show' = 1, 'view' = 2, 'click' = 3)`. But select from that table shows that there can be 1000x more clicks than views, and it's not just old data, they are growing faster right now. I remind, sending end logging says that this is actually not true.
2) `SELECT event_type, count(*) FROM ... GROUP BY event_type` fails with message `Unexpected value 4 for type Enum8('show' = 1, 'view' = 2, 'click' = 3)`.

Maybe later I'll provide some proofs or a testcase, but no promises.
