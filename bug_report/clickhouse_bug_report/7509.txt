Description:
Division by zero

**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
error despite the fact that the denominator is converted to null in case of zero value

**How to reproduce**
`
drop table if EXISTS test_table;
create table test_table
(
  id          int,
  revenue     Decimal(38, 12),
  count_dist  Nullable(UInt64)
) engine MergeTree()
    partition by id
    order by id;
   
  
insert into test_table (id, revenue, count_dist) values (1, 30.54, null);
insert into test_table (id, revenue, count_dist) values (2, 10, 10);
insert into test_table (id, revenue, count_dist) values (3, 50, 0);

select revenue / nullif(count_dist,0) as arpu
  from test_table;
