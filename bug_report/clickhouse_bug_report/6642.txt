Title: 19.13 Can't adjust last granule because it has 0 rows
Description:
19.13.3.26
I was playing with a 'set' data skipping index, and I got this exception while changing granularity values.
The table that I used:
```
CREATE TABLE skip_set
(
    `x` UInt64,
    INDEX x_idx x TYPE set(0) GRANULARITY 2
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY tuple()
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
```
These two queries use the skip index:
```
select count() from skip_set where x = 1;
select count() from skip_set where x in (1,2,3);
```
These two queries do not use the skip index (#6601):
```
select count() from skip_set where x in (select toUInt64(1));
select count() from skip_set where x in (select number from numbers(3))
```
The exceptions:
1. set (0) GRANULARITY 8 index_granularity = 256
```
SET allow_experimental_data_skipping_indices = 1;
drop table if exists skip_set;
CREATE TABLE skip_set (x UInt64, INDEX x_idx x TYPE set (0) GRANULARITY 8) ENGINE = MergeTree () order BY tuple() SETTINGS index_granularity = 256;
insert into skip_set (x) select number from numbers(100000);

SELECT count()
FROM skip_set
WHERE x IN (1, 2, 3)
