Title: MaterializeMySQL doesn't remove deleted rows
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Delete operation take place from MySQL side, and the operation should be synced to ClickHouse, however, the data is still there.

I'm not sure if this is the desired behavior, or not realized yet, please give me some explain.
