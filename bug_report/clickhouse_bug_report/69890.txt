Title: Bad mutations with virtual columns
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Mutations get stuck when I filter by virtual columns.
For example, `ALTER TABLE tab DELETE WHERE _part_offset < 3;`

With `mutations_sync=1`, it reports
```
Received exception from server (version 24.8.4):
Code: 341. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. 
DB::Exception: Exception happened during execution of mutation 'mutation_2.txt' with part 'all_1_1_0' 
reason: 'Code: 49. DB::Exception: Virtual column _part_offset must be filled by range reader: While executing MergeTreeSequentialSource. (LOGICAL_ERROR) (version 24.8.4.13 (official build))'. 
This error maybe retryable or not. In case of unretryable error, mutation can be killed with KILL MUTATION query. (UNFINISHED)
(query: ALTER TABLE tab DELETE WHERE _part_offset < 3 SETTINGS mutations_sync=1;)
```
