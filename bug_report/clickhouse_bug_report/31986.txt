Title: Wrong aggregation result since 21.11
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**
Since it is not necessarily reproducible in original data set, so I will just describe what it looks like:
```
CREATE TABLE t
(
    id Int64,
    type String,
    values Float64,
    event_date DateTime
)
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/{shard}/path', '{replica}')
PARTITION BY (toYYYYMMDD(event_date))
ORDER BY (id);

-- insert some data

SELECT * FROM t
┌──id─┬─type──┬──values─┬──────────event_date─┐
│ 111 │  aaa  │ 23.1234 │ 2021-11-30 00:00:00 │
│ 222 │  bbb  │ 52.1124 │ 2021-11-30 00:00:00 │
└─────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────────────────┘
```
And here is the query like:
```
SELECT
    id, type, sum(values)
FROM t
WHERE type = 'aaa'
GROUP BY id, type
```
The result is expected to be
```
┌──id─┬─type──┬─sum(values)─┐
│ 111 │  aaa  │     23.1234 │
└─────┴───────┴─────────────┘
```
But in version `21.11` I just got result as below:
```
┌──id─┬─type──┬─sum(values)─┐
│ 111 │  aaa  │     23.1234 │
│ 222 │  aaa  │     52.1124 │
└─────┴───────┴─────────────┘
```
It looks like the filter `type = 'aaa'` worked in a strange way that the row with `id = 222` was also selected into the result and the row's `type` field was assigned with the value `'aaa'` where `id = 222` never had `type = 'aaa'`.

Please let me know if I didn't make myself clear.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
According to my test, the misbehavior happens in `21.11.2.2`,`21.11.3.6` and `21.11.4.14`.
But it always works as expected in and before `21.10.3.9`.
So I assume it is related to some changes introduced since `21.11`.

**How to reproduce**
It is not necessarily reproducible in original data set. I haven't found a pattern yet. So it's hard to give an exact example. 
The example above is more like a description of this issue. In fact I can't reproduce it by this example in `21.11`.
I firstly found this issue because I was comparing a large number of regression-query result between `21.11` and older version and I got different result rows in some cases.
I'm not sure if this issue happens in your CI regression cases.
But it surely is a bug that under some circumstances, filters misbehaved and rows that was expected to filtered out would be wrongly shown in the result set. 

It is introduced since 21.11, please pay serious attention.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
No exception was thrown.
