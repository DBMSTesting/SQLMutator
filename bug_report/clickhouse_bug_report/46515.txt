Title: background_pool_size (and similars) referenced as obsolete
Description:
**Describe the issue**

`background_pool_size` setting, and its siblings `background_*_pool_size` appears as obsolete everywhere but AFAIK they were just moved from default user scope to server settings.

When checking those settings to see which one you're to change it's a bit misleading since documentation says they are available (and they are) but looking around in the code, and in `system.settings` looks like they are obsolete.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM system.settings
WHERE name = 'background_pool_size'

┌─name─────────────────┬─value─┬─changed─┬─description─────────────────────┬─min──┬─max──┬─readonly─┬─type───┐
│ background_pool_size │ 16    │       0 │ Obsolete setting, does nothing. │ ᴺᵁᴸᴸ │ ᴺᵁᴸᴸ │        0 │ UInt64 │
└──────────────────────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────────────────────────────┴──────┴──────┴──────────┴────────┘
```

Are they really obsolete, or is this just a side effect from the scope change?
