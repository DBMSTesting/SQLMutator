Title: Incorrect batch insert data
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**
I use https://github.com/housepower/ClickHouse-Native-JDBC and https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-jdbc in two ways, when inserting data, has appeared in a total number is correct, but writes data column of chaotic situation.For example, the original data is ('aaa',...', 'aaa'), turns out to be ('aaa'..., 'BBB').This' BBB 'should be some other row

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
19.17.4.11

* Which interface to use, if matters
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
`CREATE TABLE log_center.basiclog_gw_admin ON CLUSTER ck_cluster2
(
  timestamp DateTime,
  http_x_request_id String,
  traceId String,
  server_name String,
  upstream_status String,
  request String,
  request_length UInt32,
  http_x_app_id String,
  upstr_addr String, 
  hostname String,
  request_method String,
  http_cookie String,
  body_bytes_sent UInt32,
  http_user_agent String,
  remote_user String,
  xes_request_type String,
  remote_addr String,
  request_body String,
  xes_app String,
  http_referrer String,
  connection_requests UInt32,
  url String, 
  upstream_response_time String, 
  status UInt16,
  rpcId String,
  http_x_forwarded_for String,
  request_time Float64,
  scheme String
) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{layer}-{shard}/log_center/basiclog_gw_admin', '{replica}') 
PARTITION BY toDate(timestamp) 
ORDER BY (timestamp) 
TTL timestamp + toIntervalDay(30)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192,storage_policy='ssd';

CREATE TABLE log_center.basiclog_gw_admin_all ON CLUSTER ck_cluster2 AS log_center.basiclog_gw_admin ENGINE = Distributed(ck_cluster2, log_center, basiclog_gw_admin, rand());`

* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

**Expected behavior**
`select count(*) from basiclog_gw_admin_all where server_name='xxx' AND domain!='xxx' ;`
It should be 0, but it's greater than 0

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
no error
