Title: Constant value 0(Int8) is regarded as positional argument and cause out-of-range exception
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.
```SQL
--- T1 table can be any MergeTree table
select 0 as $col1 from T1 group by $col1;
```
then you will get an exception
`Code: 43. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9101. DB::Exception: Positional argument out of bounds: 0 (exprected in range [1, 1]. (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)`

It should be caused by the reason: `group by $col1` is replaced by `group by 0` and `0` is regarded as a positional argument.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
22.8.5.x
