Title: Bug report: Strange error message "Unknown identifier: c3" while processing SELECT query
Description:
**Describe the bug**

I used my fuzzing tool to test ClickHouse (v21.5.6.6-stable), and found that it returned stange error message when processing a sql.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

v21.5.6.6-stable

**How to reproduce**

* ClickHouse server version: v21.5.6.6-stable
* Installation: 
```
1. mkdir build; cd build
2. cmake ..  \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug     \
        -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_ALL=OFF     \
        -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_SERVER=ON     \
        -DENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_CLIENT=ON     \
        -DENABLE_LIBRARIES=OFF     \
        -DUSE_UNWIND=ON     \
        -DENABLE_UTILS=OFF     \
        -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DSANITIZE=address
3. sudo make install
```

* Test command: 
```
1. clickhouse-server &

2. clickhouse-client --query '
create table t_f45r0wv (
c_s INTEGER ,
c_h INTEGER NOT NULL,
c_il8 INTEGER NOT NULL,
c_jb2ubj TEXT NOT NULL,
primary key(c_h)
) engine = MergeTree();'

3. clickhouse-client --query '
select
  case when subq_0.c5 >= (
      select  
            ref_7.c_h as c0
          from t_f45r0wv as ref_7
        ) then subq_0.c9 else subq_0.c9 end
     as c3,
  (subq_0.c3 * subq_0.c10) as c4
from
  (select
        ref_0.c_il8 as c3,
        ref_0.c_h as c5,
        ref_0.c_s as c9,
        ref_0.c_il8 as c10 
      from
        t_f45r0wv as ref_0
  ) as subq_0
;'
```

**Expected behavior**

Normally run without any error message

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

```
Received exception from server (version 21.5.6):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown identifier: c3; there are columns: c5, c9, c10, NULL, greaterOrEquals(c5, NULL), multiIf(greaterOrEquals(c5, NULL), c9, c9): While processing multiIf(c5 >= (NULL AS _subquery2513), c9, c9) AS c3, c3 * c10 AS c4.
```

**Additional context**

When I use the following SELECT query which **does not select c4**, it succeed. So I suspect there is bug.
```
clickhouse-client --query '
select                  
  case when subq_0.c5 >= (
      select  
            ref_7.c_h as c0
          from t_f45r0wv as ref_7
        ) then subq_0.c9 else subq_0.c9 end
     as c3 
from                            
  (select
        ref_0.c_il8 as c3,
        ref_0.c_h as c5,
        ref_0.c_s as c9,
        ref_0.c_il8 as c10 
      from                 
        t_f45r0wv as ref_0
  ) as subq_0
;'
```
I am not sure whether this bug is duplicated with #25335, but they looks different. So I hope you can help me confirm this issue.
