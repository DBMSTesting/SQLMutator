Title: "Illegal column for DataTypeNullable" with indexed column
Description:
**How to reproduce**
```
ClickHouse client version 20.11.5.18 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 20.11.5 revision 54442.

create table test (id UInt64,insid UInt64,insidvalue Nullable(UInt64), index insid_idx (insid) type bloom_filter() granularity 1, index insidvalue_idx (insidvalue) type bloom_filter() granularity 1) ENGINE=MergeTree() ORDER BY (insid,id);

insert into test values(1,1,1),(2,2,2);

select * from test where insid IN (1) OR insidvalue IN (1);

=> Code: 44. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Illegal column for DataTypeNullable.
```

**Additional context**
it works if I remove one of the two indexes or if I inverse the clause (insidvalue IN(1) OR insid IN (1).

note: index on insid seems redundant with primary key but in our real table, insid is not in first position of ORDER BY.
