Title: MaterializeMySQLSyncThread: Code: 32, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Attempt to read after eof
Description:
**Describe the bug**
The bug may not be reproduced on each platform.

**How to reproduce**
* Set up replication relationship between MySQL and ClickHouse
* When data copy has completed and after a while, stop ClickHouse service
* Wait for 0.5 hour, start ClickHouse service, you will get odd error, may different from each time

**Additional comment**
I strongly suspect MySQL replication protocol send abnormal message to ClickHouse, which cause ClickHouse side code unable to parse the message
* Is it possible to print the abnormal message?
* Is there a mechanism to let MySQL resend required binlog message, if the fetch one is abnormal?

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
