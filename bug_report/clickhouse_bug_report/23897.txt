Title: Increasing postgres connections
Description:
Since the latest update **21.4.1** Clickhouse keeps creating new Postgres connections. 

There is only a single dictionary with postgres as data source

On 11:40 I upgraded CH to 21.4.1 from 21.3.9. I have one Postgres dictionary set up and as you can see in the chart the connections kept growing. The connection drops are CH server restarts.
On 15:55 I downgraded again to 21.3.9 and everything seems fine now.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 21.4.1
* Create a postgres dictionary 
* Montior the connections of  postgres 

**Expected behavior**
Allow to limit max connections for external connection. Especially for my usecase a single connection should be enough.
