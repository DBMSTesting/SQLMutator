Description:

As part of backing up a table, the ```ALTER TABLE `db`.`table_name` FREEZE WITH NAME '<name>'``` command fails with 

```
"error can't freeze table: code: 84, message: Directory /var/lib/clickhouse/shadow/d57f9386bfb34faeae1a2d275cf051ea/data/<db>/<table_name>/20201105_0_9627_12 already exists and is not empty."

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

This is a production cluster running on v20.9.3.45.  This issue hasn't been seen on other clusters where we have enabled backups. 

We haven't upgraded to a release later than v20.9.3.45.
