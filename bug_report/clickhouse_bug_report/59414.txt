Columns involving certain arithmetic expressions are not given the name I assign to them.

```

SELECT sum(number + 1) AS b
FROM system.numbers
WHERE number <= 5

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

```
6f7bc8975d05 :) select version();

SELECT version()

Query id: 003ff2e5-b70c-409c-9266-958d54dac6f6

```

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use

See above

* Which interface to use, if matters

It shouldn't matter

* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

See above

**Expected behavior**

> A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

I expect to see a column named `b` in the output.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

> If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
