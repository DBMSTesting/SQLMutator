Title: Errorneous predicate handling/optimization
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

It seems that sql function is being applied to data which should be filtered beforehand.

If you try
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/66aaa9fd-ea9a-4ca7-9acd-81ebdca271c1
If you uncomment the "where" clause, CH fails. If you then uncomment the "limit" clause, which possibly forces inner select materialization, it starts working again.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

According to Fiddle - yes

**How to reproduce**

Just run the query from link provided

**Expected behavior**

Enabling "where" clause in outer select shouldn't break the execution

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

Received exception from server (version 23.2.4):
Code: 32. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Attempt to read after eof: Cannot parse Int64 from String, because value is too short: While processing (toInt64((['115'] AS `field.value`)[indexOf([15] AS `field.id`, 10)]) > 0) AND (indexOf(`field.id`, 10) != 0).
