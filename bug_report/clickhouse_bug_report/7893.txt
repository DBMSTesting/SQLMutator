Title: FINAL doesn't work in SummingMergeTree
Description:
FINAL doesn't work in SummingMergeTree

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 19.4 or 19.16
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
```
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS item_labels (
            item_id UInt64,
            country_code FixedString(2),
            label_code UInt16,
            flag Int8,
            updated_at DateTime
        )
        ENGINE = SummingMergeTree(flag)
        PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(updated_at)
        ORDER BY (
            item_id,
            country_code,
            label_code
        )
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
Doesn't work:
```
SELECT 
    item_id, 
    country_code, 
    MAX(label_code)
FROM item_labels
FINAL
GROUP BY 
    item_id, 
    country_code

```
Work well:
```
SELECT 
    item_id, 
    country_code, 
    MAX(label_code)
FROM item_labels
GROUP BY 
    item_id, 
    country_code
HAVING SUM(flag) > 0
```
