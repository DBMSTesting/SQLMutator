Title: A simple way how to break a sorting order of the table
Description:
**Company or project name**

ClickHouse inc. 

**Describe what's wrong**

https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/e56fc07f-4200-48d6-a3b3-d7c415f5fc67

**How to reproduce**

```
CREATE TABLE test (a UInt64) ENGINE=MergeTree() ORDER BY a;

INSERT INTO test (a) SELECT 1 FROM numbers(1000);

SET mutations_sync=2;
ALTER TABLE test ADD COLUMN b Float64 AFTER a, MODIFY ORDER BY (a, b);
ALTER TABLE test MODIFY COLUMN b DEFAULT rand64() % 100000;
ALTER TABLE test MATERIALIZE COLUMN b;

SET optimize_throw_if_noop=1;
OPTIMIZE TABLE test FINAL;

Received exception from server (version 24.10.1):
Code: 341. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Exception happened during execution of mutation 'mutation_2.txt' with part 'all_1_1_0' reason: 'Code: 49. DB::Exception: Sort order of blocks violated for column number 1, left: Float64_61334, right: Float64_54618. Chunk 0, rows read 3. (LOGICAL_ERROR) (version 24.10.1.2812 (official build))'. This error maybe retryable or not. In case of unretryable error, mutation can be killed with KILL MUTATION query. (UNFINISHED)
(query: ALTER TABLE test MATERIALIZE COLUMN b;)
```

**Expected behavior**

It is not possible to execute MATERIALIZE COLUMN for a column in the ORDER BY key.
