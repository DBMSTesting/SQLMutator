Title: Unexpected results from using ReplacingMergeTree with Tuple and FINAL
Description:
**Version**
`v24.3.1.890`

**Description**
I have a table that uses `AggregatingMergeTree` and one of the columns has a tuple type.  Querying the tuple column with name and is returning different results compared to with index.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**
Yes. https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/90dfd9e1-3f9c-4c15-b2d3-560378dbe149

**How to reproduce**
You can take a look at the fiddle link above for the DDL and DML.

**Expected behavior**
```
select user_id, latest.timestamp, latest.amount from balances final;
select user_id, latest.1, latest.2 from balances final;
```
Should return the same results as it should be returning the same row.
