Title: There is no supertype for types UInt64, Int64 when using alter table update
Description:
when I used sql like `ALTER TABLE XXX update cost = ? , traffic = ? where  1` 
, and I also prepare sql ,  and cost, traffic type is `Nullable(Int64)`,  unfortunately get such error below:

`code: 386, message: There is no supertype for types UInt64, Int64 because some of them are signed integers and some are unsigned integers, but there is no signed integer type, that can exactly represent all required unsigned integer values`

I also found error exists  when exceed Int32  max limit = 2147483647 , but I don't know why?
