**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
Inserting rows in to a file table function fails with an error about globs in the filepath when no globs are present in the filepath.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
19.17.5 revision 54428

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```sql
insert into table function file('abc.csv', 'CSV', 'val1 UInt32') values (1)
