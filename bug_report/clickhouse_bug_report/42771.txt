Title: NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK  in aggregation from a subquery for some functions with a where clause
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

```
 create table test 
(
    "name" String,
     "time" Int64 ) 
ENGINE=MergeTree() primary key (time) order by (time);

insert into test Values('hello world', 1662336000241);
```
run query:
```
SELECT count()
FROM
(
    SELECT
        fromUnixTimestamp64Milli(time, 'UTC') AS time_fmt,
        name
    FROM test
    WHERE time_fmt > '2022-09-05 00:00:00'
);
```
or 
```
SELECT count() FROM ( SELECT toInt128(time) AS time_fmt, name FROM test WHERE time_fmt > 1662336000240)
```
get the following error:
```

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.010 sec.

Received exception from server (version 22.10.1):
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column time in block. (NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK)
```

if no where  clause.
the result is correct:
```
SELECT count() FROM ( SELECT toInt128(time) AS time_fmt, name FROM test)

┌─count()─┐
│       1 │
└─────────┘
```


**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
yes

* Which ClickHouse server version to use

-------+
      1|
```
