Title: CREATE VIEW with postgres table function results in connections growth without limit in 21.6, but not in 21.4
Description:
**Describe the issue**
After an update from CH 21.4.6.55 to CH 21.6.5.37 I noticed an endless growth of idle connections on PosgtreSQL side (which is configured as a sync replica, without expiration of idle connections).

My configuration:
- 2-nodes CH cluster
- Multiple `Engine=PostgreSQL()` tables

PostgreSQL stats:
The 21.6.5.37 version was deployed on June, 30th at mid-day (which is the start of the endless growth). The previous version was running for some times:

Settings are those by default for PostgreSQL table engine, profile side `postgresql_connection_pool_size` was also the default value (16 from what I saw in the code).

Not sure if it might be related, but I noticed from my stats that new connections to CH seem to trigger new connections to PostgreSQL (and no re-use?), but that's my 2 cents. Maybe also present in CH 21.5, I did not see any breaking change in the 21.6 changelog.
