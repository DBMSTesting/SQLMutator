Title: ClickHouse AST Formatter adds a spurious AS when echoing query with ASOF-join.
Description:
**Describe the bug**
ClickHouse AST Formatter adds a spurious AS when echoing query with ASOF-join.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: ClickHouse server version 19.11.2 revision 54423
* Which interface to use, if matters: ClickHouse client version 19.1.14
* Non-default settings, if any: None
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result:
```
SELECT * FROM (SELECT toDateTime((number * 1) + 1000000000.) AS d, 1 AS e FROM numbers(12)) ASOF LEFT JOIN  (SELECT toDateTime((number * 2.678) + 1000000000.) AS d, 1 AS e, number * 10 AS q FROM numbers(12)) USING (e, d)
```

**Expected behavior**
ClickHouse should echo and execute the query as follows:
```
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT
        toDateTime((number * 1) + 1000000000.) AS d,
        1 AS e
    FROM numbers(12)
) ASOF
LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT
        toDateTime((number * 2.678) + 1000000000.) AS d,
        1 AS e,
        number * 10 AS q
    FROM numbers(12)
) USING (e, d)
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
ClickHouse executes the query correctly, but it is echoed with an additional 'AS':
```
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT
        toDateTime((number * 1) + 1000000000.) AS d,
        1 AS e
    FROM numbers(12)
) AS ASOF
LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT
        toDateTime((number * 2.678) + 1000000000.) AS d,
        1 AS e,
        number * 10 AS q
    FROM numbers(12)
) USING (e, d)
```
We've got bitten by this when copying the nicely formatted form auf the query to include in documentation.
