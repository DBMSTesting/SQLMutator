Title: Exception "There's no column in table" do not raise as expected
Description:
ClickHouse version 22.3.3.44

When I execute a small query:
```
	select  
 	   q1.a, 
	   countIf(q1.a, q2.b > 1)
	from 
	    (select 1 as a, 2 as b) q1
	inner join
        (select 1 as a, 22 as c) as q2 using a
	group by q1.a
```
I always have exception "Code: 47. DB::Exception: There's no column 'q2.b' in table 'q2': ...". 
Of course it's correct, because subquery "q2" does not have column with name "b".

But when I modify query a little bit:
```
	select  
 	   q1.a, 
	   countIf(q1.a, q2.b > 1)
	from 
	    (select 1 as a, 2 as b) q1
	inner join
        (select 1 as a, 22 as c) as q2 using a
	left join 
     	(select 1 as a) as q3 on q1.a = q3.a
	group by q1.a
```	
Exception disapeers and query executed successesfully.
But subquery "q2" still does not have the column with name "b".

In such case ClickHouse think this is OK to use the column "q1.b" instead of nonexistent "q2.b".
