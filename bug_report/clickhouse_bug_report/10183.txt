Title: clickhouse-server docker initdb script sourcing ignores errors
Description:
Investigating some flaky builds we found that the initdb script doesn't check errors or issue retries for failed migrations:

https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/0ecfede695638a9565eb6815bf1772d7ea5445bc/docker/server/entrypoint.sh#L84-L100

Occasionally on our CI, the clickhouse client connection to zookeeper unexpectedly closes, which in turn causes the initial migration script to fail silently.

Zookeeper issues aside, I believe that the script should at least be checking that the migrations applied successfully (return code from clickhouse-client is 0).
