Title: Incorrect and non-deterministic group by in 24.12 when joining over LowCardinality(String) and a 64bit type is involved

MRE: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/d61fe685-4c26-4cd3-8c49-81e8a29727a2

```
CREATE TABLE a (x LowCardinality(String)) ENGINE=Memory;
CREATE TABLE b (x LowCardinality(String), y Float64) ENGINE=Memory;

INSERT INTO a 
SELECT 
  (number % 500)::String AS x
FROM (
    SELECT number
    FROM numbers(40000000)
)
ORDER BY x;

INSERT INTO b
SELECT 
  (number % 500)::String x,
  0 as y
FROM (SELECT number FROM numbers(500));

select count() from (
  SELECT any(y)
  FROM a
  left join b using x
  group by x
  order by x
);
```

In the example above, we expect to have 500 groups (x ranges from 0 to 499) but we get a non-deterministic count that ranges between 500 and 510.

All elements in the MRE seem important, even changing the insert order stops the bug from happening. This seems like maybe a hash collision issue, possibly memory safety ? It seems to only be present in 24.12.*

### Does it reproduce on the most recent release?

No

### How to reproduce

See MRE above

### Expected behavior

Output of 500
