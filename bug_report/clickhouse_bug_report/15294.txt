Title: Scalar subquery optimization
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Scalar some type doesn't exist
I checked with table, which was be created by engine of memory. And this query is worked.
But MergeTree doesn't work.

**How to reproduce**
1) create table TestTable (`column` String, start DateTime, end DateTime) engine MergeTree order by start;
2) insert into TestTable (column, start, end) values
  ('test', toDateTime('2020-07-20 09:00:00'), toDateTime('2020-07-20 20:00:00')),
  ('test1', toDateTime('2020-07-20 09:00:00'), toDateTime('2020-07-20 20:00:00')),
  ('test2', toDateTime('2020-07-20 09:00:00'), toDateTime('2020-07-20 20:00:00'));

       (SELECT d from (select [1, 2, 3, 4] as d)) as d
FROM TestTable
where column == 'test'
GROUP BY column;

**Additional context**
When 
SET enable_scalar_subquery_optimization=0;
query is worked
