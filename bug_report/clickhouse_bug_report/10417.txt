Title:  Table function 's3' cannot access non-default region
Description:
I am trying to query parquets from S3 in a next way:
`select * from s3('https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/..., 'key', 'secret', 'Parquet', '...') LIMIT 10`

But getting:
`Received exception from server (version 20.3.7):
Code: 499. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unable to parse ExceptionName: AuthorizationHeaderMalformed Message: The authorization header is malformed; the region 'us-east-1' is wrong; expecting 'eu-west-1'.`
