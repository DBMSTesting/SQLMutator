Title: LOGICAL_ERROR: Bad cast from type DB::ColumnVector<char8_t> to DB::ColumnVector<signed char>
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

The SELECT statement should output results normally, but it threw an exception.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

It can be reproduced in the latest version.

**How to reproduce**

Version: 23.5.1.1 (commit 3e6314675c6467bc4dd78f659bac862f7e9648f8)

Easy reproduce in ClickHouse fiddle: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/4996cfc2-e407-4c7e-b9e9-de67e040bbc9

_Set up database_

```sql
create table t0 (pkey UInt32, c1 UInt32, primary key(pkey)) engine = MergeTree;
create table t1 (vkey UInt32, primary key(vkey)) engine = MergeTree;
create table t3 (c17 String, primary key(c17)) engine = MergeTree;
insert into t1 values (3);
```

_Bug-triggering query_

```sql
WITH 
cte_1 AS (select  
    subq_1.c_5_c1698_16 as c_2_c1702_3, 
    subq_1.c_5_c1694_12 as c_2_c1703_4
  from 
    (select  
          covarPop(-0, 74) as c_5_c1686_4, 
          sumWithOverflow(0) as c_5_c1694_12, 
          covarPop(-53.64, 92.63) as c_5_c1698_16
        from 
          t3 as ref_8
        group by ref_8.c17) as subq_1)
select 
    ref_15.c_2_c1703_4 as c_2_c1723_6, 
    ref_15.c_2_c1702_3 as c_2_c1724_7
  from 
    t0 as ref_14
        RIGHT outer join cte_1 as ref_15
        on (ref_14.c1 = ref_15.c_2_c1702_3)
      RIGHT outer join t1 as ref_16
      on (ref_14.pkey = ref_16.vkey);
```

**Expected behavior**

The SELECT statement is executed without any error.

**Actual behavior**

It throws an exception:
```
Received exception from server (version 23.4.2):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: There's no column 'subq_1.c_5_c1698_16' in table 'subq_1': While processing subq_1.c_5_c1698_16 AS c_2_c1702_3. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER)
