Title: X-ClickHouse-Summary are not accurate
Description:
Hello,

In the last master 27f365dc10d0ed59a25c4203869724d4d218c9b9 the stats from `X-ClickHouse-Summary` are not accurate. If you use the type JSON where the stats are sent in the response body as well you can find that those are different than the one from `X-ClickHouse-Summary`.

For example running:

```sql
SELECT * from system.numbers LIMIT 100000
```

in `X-ClickHouse-Summary` I can see rows_read 65536 and in JSON body 131072.
            
Investigating the problem I found out that after the `WriteBufferFromHTTPServerResponse::nextImpl()` is called because of the 
line with `out->setAutoFlush();` from `executeQuery.cpp`, few more `WriteBufferFromHTTPServerResponse::onProgress(const Progress & progress)` are called but those are ignored because `headers_finished_sending` is now true. 

Commenting the `out->setAutoFlush()` makes the stats to be the same with the one from JSON body but I'm sure this is not the proper solution.
