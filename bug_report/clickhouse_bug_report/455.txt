Title: Cannot open file tmp_sizes.json: No such file or directory, when renaming a table
Description:
Hello

Since ClickHouse does not have `truncate`, I thought I would just create a new table with `create ... as` and then rename it:

    create table test (s String) engine=TinyLog;

    create table test_new as test;
    drop table test;
    rename table test_new to test;

But inserting into the new table gives an error:

    insert into test values ('hello');

>  Code: 107. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Cannot open file /opt/clickhouse/data/default/test_new/tmp_sizes.json, errno: 2, strerror: No such file or directory. 

Some part of ClickHouse is still using the old name (notice `.../test_new/...`)

By the way, one workarond is to first rename and then create:

    rename table test to test_old;
    create table test as test_old;
    drop table test_old;
