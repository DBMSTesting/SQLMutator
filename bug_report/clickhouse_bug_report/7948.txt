Title: Partition pruning not working as expected
Description:
**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: v19.17.2.4-testing

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_partition_filtering;

CREATE TABLE test_partition_filtering (
    `timestamp` DateTime,
    zoneId UInt64
) ENGINE = MergeTree() 
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(timestamp)
ORDER BY (zoneId, timestamp);

INSERT INTO test_partition_filtering
SELECT
  toUInt64(now())-1000*number/1000 as timestamp,
  number/1000 as zone
FROM numbers(1000000);

OPTIMIZE TABLE test_partition_filtering final;

SELECT count() FROM test_partition_filtering WHERE toDate(toStartOfDay(timestamp)) = today() and zoneId=42;
SELECT count() FROM test_partition_filtering WHERE toDate(timestamp) = today() AND zoneId = 42;
```

**Expected behavior**
Expect both SELECTS to prune partitions and to read just a single part.

**Actual behavior**
First query reads one part. Second query reads 12 parts.

**Logs**

```
