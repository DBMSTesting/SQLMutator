Title: Second argument to CAST must be a constant string describing type  error when doing operations on Nullable(UInt64) type column
Description:


**Describe the bug**
I have a table with column  column1 of type Nullable(UInt32). I cannot do operations on that data-type like
select * from table_name where column1 is not NULL or even simple operations like
select * from table_name where column1 !=0. It used to work in the previous versions
A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
19.16.10.44

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
select * from table_name where column1 !=0
**Error message and/or stacktrace**
Second argument to CAST must be a constant string describing type

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
