Title: Incorrect count() with condition query result for SummingMergeTree.
Description:
Sample scenario:
```sql
create table tst (
  timestamp DateTime, val Nullable(Int8)
) engine SummingMergeTree partition by toYYYYMM(timestamp) ORDER by (timestamp);

insert into tst values
       ('2018-02-01 00:00:00', 1),
       ('2018-02-02 00:00:00', 2);

select count(1) from tst where timestamp is not null;
-- 2

select count(1) from tst final where timestamp is not null;
-- 0

select * from tst final;
-- 2018-02-01 00:00:00;1
-- 2018-02-02 00:00:00;2
```

Both FINAL and w/o FINAL count() queries should have the same result - 2.
