Title: Error in query preparation (but query is correct)
Description:
I try to make query:
```
SELECT avg(net) AS payments_amount
FROM default.payments AS t 
WHERE t.payments_amount > 0
```
And it fails with error:
```
Received exception from server:
Code: 184. DB::Exception: Received from clickhouse-server:9000, 172.17.0.3. DB::Exception: Aggregate function avg(net) is found in WHERE or PREWHERE in query.
```
Problem appear when select field name (AS payments_amount) same as field in table.
 **t.payments_amount** try to link with field in results **payments_amount**.
I specified table name as **t**, and field in **WHERE** must use field from table, not from results.

P.S.:
Create table statement: https://pastebin.com/uNm1JeNB
