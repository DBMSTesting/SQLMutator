Title: Incorrect behavior NOT IN operator
Description:
How to reproduce:
table 'TestStore' with ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
Query:
```
select distinct app, day
from TestStore
where day = toDate('2022-12-06')
  and app in ('Test1', 'Test2')
  and (app,  day) not in (
        select app, day
        from TestStore lds
        where day = toDate('2022-12-06')
          and app = 'Test1'
      );
```

Expected result:
This query should return one row with app = 'Test2', but nothing return.
But if I add “= 1” to NOT IN condition like as 
```
select distinct app, day
from TestStore
where day = toDate('2022-12-06')
  and app in ('Test1', 'Test2')
  and (app,  day) not in (
        select app, day
        from TestStore lds
        where day = toDate('2022-12-06')
          and app = 'Test1'
      ) = 1;
```
then anything is ok.
