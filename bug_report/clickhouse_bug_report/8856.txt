Title: Server not starting after reboot
Description:
We run CH in a docker container. The server running the container was rebooted. Now when I try to start the server it fails. I exec a shell in the container and try to start the server manually, it shows:

```
root@8968db8dbd4d:/# service clickhouse-server start
Start clickhouse-server service: Path to data directory in /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml: /var/lib/clickhouse/
UNKNOWN
root@8968db8dbd4d:/#
```

The files in /var/log/clickhouse-server look like:

```
root@8968db8dbd4d:/# ls -l /var/log/clickhouse-server/
total 4
-rw-r-----. 1 clickhouse clickhouse   0 Jan 27 15:05 clickhouse-server.err.log
-rw-r-----. 1 clickhouse clickhouse   0 Jan 27 15:05 clickhouse-server.log
-rw-r-----. 1 clickhouse clickhouse 598 Jan 27 15:15 stderr.log
-rw-r-----. 1 clickhouse clickhouse   0 Jan 27 15:05 stdout.log
```

The stderr.log shows this error:

```Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 0, e.displayText() = Exception: Cannot change directory to /var/lib/clickhouse/cores (version 19.17.6.36 (official build)```

The clickhouse server had been running for at least a month and I suspect that in the interim that the image the container is based on was rebuilt and maybe a new version of CH was installed. It's also possible I am forgetting a crucial step in restarting the server. 

Does anyone have an idea of what I am doing wrong? Is the Poco error the problem Thanks for any help.
