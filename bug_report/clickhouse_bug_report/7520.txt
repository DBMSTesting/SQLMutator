Title: GROUP BY using WITH columns alias don't work if we call the column using the column name on SELECT
Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**

If we do a `GROUP BY` using an alias column on the `WITH`, it consider the following column as not part of the `ORDER BY`

**How to reproduce**
Clickhouse server v19.14.3
```
CREATE TABLE test (`a` UInt32, `b` UInt32) ENGINE = Memory;

WITH
    a as key
SELECT
    a as k1,
    sum(b) as k2
FROM
    test
GROUP BY
    key
ORDER BY k1, k2;

Code: 215. DB::Exception: Received from 127.0.0.1:10000. DB::Exception: Column a is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY.. 
```

**Expected behavior**
This query should be executable as the alias `key` and the column `a` share the same expression.
