Title: "clickhouse-odbc-bridge is not responding" during dictionary initialization: program startup sequence problems
Description:
docker version: 1.13.1
clickhouse version: 20.3.11.97
system: centos7

The **/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/** path contains the sql file, and the sql contains the **odbc  Dictionary ENGINE**; when the **_entrypoint.sh_** script is executed, there is a certain probability that the dictionary table creation fails: `Code: 410. DB::Exception: Received from 127.0.0.1:9000. DB::Exception: ODBCBridgeHelper: clickhouse-odbc-bridge is not responding.`

Only after the clickhouse-odbc-bridge process is completely started, the creation of the obdc table will be added manually again.

the [ODBC](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/integrations/odbc/)  `ClickHouse automatically starts clickhouse-odbc-bridge when it is required`, But what is this trigger mechanism? Can the above problems be solved in entrypoint.sh?

**entrypoint.sh  log:**
```
