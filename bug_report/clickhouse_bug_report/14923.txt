Title: CPU frequency in asynchronous metrics must use 'processor', not 'core id'
Description:
This [core id] assumes single CPU per system, because core id is unique per physical CPU. I'm also not sure if hyperthreads necessarily run at the same frequency on all CPUs. Having a metric per logical CPU alleviates both issues.
