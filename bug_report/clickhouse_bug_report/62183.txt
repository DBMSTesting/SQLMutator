Title: CASE expression should apply only first match, not last one, if there are multiple matches
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

If a `CASE` expression has multiple matches, only the first matching `WHEN` clause should apply, not the last one.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 24.3.1.2672
* Which interface to use, if it matters: JDBC or https://fiddle.clickhouse.com

Run this:

```sql
select case 1 when 1 then 2 when 1 then 4 end;
```

It produces `4`.
