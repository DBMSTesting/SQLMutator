Title: IF NOT EXISTS clause in CREATE USER throwing exception when user already exists
Description:
**Describe the bug**
when some user 'user0' already exists, and I try to run `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS user0`, ClickHouse throws an exception 'cannot insert user0 because user user0 already exists'

**How to reproduce**
```
ClickHouse client version 20.6.1.4066 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 20.6.1 revision 54436.

clicktest :) CREATE USER user0

CREATE USER user0
Ok.
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec. 

clicktest :) CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS user0

CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS user0

Received exception from server (version 20.6.1):
Code: 493. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: user `user0`: cannot insert because user `user0` already exists in [disk]. 

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec. 

```

**Expected behavior**
I expect that the query `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS some_user` would only execute if the user `some_user` does not already exist, and therefore, this command would not throw an exception.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
Queries and error above.
