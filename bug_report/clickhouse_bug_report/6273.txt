Title: Materialized views do not store data complaining about missing columns
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Given the following tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS source
(
  `timestamp` DateTime, 
  `number` UInt32,
  `date1` Date,
  `date2` Date
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(timestamp)
ORDER BY (timestamp);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS number_date (
  date Date,
  number UInt32,
  dates_in_between Date,
  count UInt32
) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree(count)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(date)
ORDER BY (date, number, dates_in_between);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS number_date_view TO number_date AS
SELECT date, number, toDate(dates) as dates_in_between, CAST(count(*), 'UInt32') AS count
FROM 
(
    WITH 86400 AS dayseconds
    SELECT 
        toDate(timestamp) AS date, 
        number, 
        timeSlots(toDateTime(date1, 'Zulu'), toUInt32((dateDiff('day', date1, date2) - 1) * dayseconds), toUInt32(dayseconds)) AS dates
    FROM source
) ARRAY JOIN dates
GROUP BY date, number, dates_in_between;
```

When I insert data in `source` table with
```sql
INSERT INTO source (timestamp, number, date1, date2) VALUES('2019-12-01 12:00:00', 77, '2020-10-01', '2020-10-03');
```

ClickHouse complains about missing columns:
```
Received exception from server (version 19.11.2):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9001. DB::Exception: Missing columns: 'date' while processing query: 'SELECT date, number, toDate(dates) AS dates_in_between, CAST(count(), 'UInt32') AS count FROM (WITH 86400 AS dayseconds SELECT toDate(timestamp) AS date, number, timeSlots(toDateTime(date1, 'Zulu'), toUInt32((dateDiff('day', date1, date2) - 1) * dayseconds), toUInt32(dayseconds)) AS dates FROM default.source) ARRAY JOIN dates GROUP BY date, number, dates_in_between', required columns: 'number' 'date', source columns: 'date1' 'timestamp' 'date2' 'number', arrayJoin columns: 'dates': while pushing to view default.number_date_view. 
```

Now. It is quite weird, since, the INSERT works perfectly if I don't create the views and it also works fine with an `INSERT FROM SELECT`
```sql
INSERT INTO number_date SELECT 
    date, 
    number, 
    toDate(dates) AS dates_in_between, 
    CAST(count(*), 'UInt32') AS count
FROM 
(
    WITH 86400 AS dayseconds
    SELECT 
        toDate(timestamp) AS date, 
        number, 
        timeSlots(toDateTime(date1, 'Zulu'), toUInt32((dateDiff('day', date1, date2) - 1) * dayseconds), toUInt32(dayseconds)) AS dates
    FROM source
)
ARRAY JOIN dates
GROUP BY 
    date, 
    number, 
    dates_in_between
```
I am running:
```
SELECT version()

┌─version()─┐
│ 19.11.2.7 │
└───────────┘
```
In docker.

Am I don't something wrongly? 
Let me know if I you need extra data.

Thanks in advance
