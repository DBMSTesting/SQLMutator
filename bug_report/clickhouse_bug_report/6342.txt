Title: Method write is not supported by storage SystemOne. 
Description:
```
CREATE TABLE test
ENGINE = Distributed('test_cluster', 'system', 'one') AS
SELECT *
FROM system.one

Received exception from server (version 19.11.2):
Code: 48. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Method write is not supported by storage SystemOne. 

(be the table created successfully)
```

Why does it tries to use method write during that?
