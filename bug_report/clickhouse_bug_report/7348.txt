Title: KafkaEngine: Polled offset INVALID after upgrade
Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
After rolling upgrade from `yandex/clickhouse-server:19.13.3.26` to `yandex/clickhouse-server:19.15.3.6`, several tables from different `ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree` are showing these errors on logs, and not showing any more data on them. For all partitions these messages are shown: 

```
2019.10.16 07:44:36.507453 [ 8 ] {} <Trace> StorageKafka (customers_kafka): Polled offset INVALID (topic: customers-0.0.1, partition: 0)
...
2019.10.16 07:44:36.507459 [ 8 ] {} <Trace> StorageKafka (customers_kafka): Polled offset INVALID (topic: customers-0.0.1, partition: 63)
```
However, consumer groups show no lag, so they are being advanced in Kafka Engine table.
There are many tables setup like this. In one database, 5/13 tables show this behaviour, in another database 1/13 tables do.

Set up is a KafkaEngine table, then a Materialized View that consumes from it and placing records into a distributed table that spans over `ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree` table.

2 servers, 1 shard each.

**How to reproduce**
Build that setup with many tables and do a rolling upgrade.

**Expected behavior**
It should keep consuming normally from where it left off before the rolling upgrade.
