Title: final stopped working after 23.12 for ReplacingMergeTree  tables with a lot of partitions and records
Description:
Getting duplicate records for ReplacingMergeTree for queries with final modifier. 
Setting compatibility = '23.12' restores proper behavior.

Test case for 24.3 : https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/399466fd-51fa-45a1-a183-c13b5a0e41d5

Seems like it needs a lot of partitions and records.
