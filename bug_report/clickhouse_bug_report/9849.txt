Title: Parameter out of bound in IColumnString::insertRangeFrom method
Description:
I get the above error in a query that is of the form:

`
select a, b, c, any(d)
from t
group by a,b,c
`

It seems to linked to a specific column, say `b`, in that if I comment it out the problem goes away. Any ideas on how to work around / troubleshoot?
