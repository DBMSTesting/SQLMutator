Recently we have used "Yandex" font and it was perfect.
But now we have switched to some unknown combination of open-source fonts that displays extremely creepy. Linux users is our main audience (for example, I am using Linux and all our developers are using Linux). Bad fonts rendering can compromise the reputation of our product.

Solutions considered:
- continue using "Yandex" font;
- find some normal open-source font;
- buy some normal font for our website.

Every solution should be validated on my PC.
