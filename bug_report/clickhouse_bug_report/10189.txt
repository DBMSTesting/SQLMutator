Title: Console output of clickhouse-client breaks some terminals
Description:
I use "kitty" terminal emulator, and such type of output
```
↗ Progress: 105.65 thousand rows, 93.17 MB (9.87 thousand rows/s., 8.70 MB/s.) ████████▊                                                                    11%

```

breaks it.

I submitted an issue to kitty, but they answered this:

```
This will be because because clickhouse-client is using an incorrect wcwidth() for the spinning arrow character. As per the unicode standard it must be two cells, clickhouse is almost certainly assuming it is one cell. Report it to them

Oh and if they want it to occupy a single cell, they need to output a U+FE0E character after it



```

Hope it can help to improve.
