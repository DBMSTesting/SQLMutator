Title: grouping function doesn't work anymore on a distributed table when allow_experimental_analyze=1
Description:
Since clickhouse 24.3 to (at least 24.9)

Query using grouping function on top of a distributed table are not working anymore. 

They are returning this error 
```
Received exception from server (version 24.8.5):
Code: 1. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Method executeImpl is not supported for 'grouping' function. (UNSUPPORTED_METHOD)
```

Here an exemple to reproduce 
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/6178e555-5909-47f8-86d8-7a474dcbdfef


```sql
CREATE TABLE shard_numbers (number UInt64) ENGINE=Memory;
CREATE TABLE dist_numbers (number UInt64) ENGINE=Distributed('default', '', 'shard_numbers', rand()) ;


insert into dist_numbers select number from numbers(10);
-- exemple from the test which is working
SELECT
    number,
    grouping(number, number % 2) AS gr
FROM numbers(10)
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS (
        (number),
        (number % 2)
    )
ORDER BY number, gr;
-- same working example with the old analyzer

SELECT
    number,
    grouping(number, number % 2) AS gr
FROM dist_numbers
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS (
        (number),
        (number % 2)
    )
ORDER BY number, gr SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer=0;

-- not working with the new analyzer

SELECT
    number,
    grouping(number, number % 2) AS gr
FROM dist_numbers
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS (
        (number),
        (number % 2)
    )
ORDER BY number, gr;

```
I try to disable one by one every settings containing the string "optimize" to see if one could have trigger this error. None seems to have solve the issue.
