Title: Wrong query optimisation throws out required columns from subqueries.
Description:
Query below works fine.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT
        learnerHash,
        passed - eventTime AS diff
    FROM statements
    GLOBAL ANY INNER JOIN
    (
        SELECT
            learnerHash,
            argMax(eventTime, resultScoreRaw) AS passed
        FROM
        (
            SELECT
                learnerHash,
                eventTime,
                resultScoreRaw
            FROM statements
            PREWHERE (courseId = 1) AND (onCourse = 0)
            WHERE (verb = 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/passed') AND (objectId = 'https://crmm.ru/xapi/courses/spp/1/1/0-1')
            ORDER BY eventTime ASC
        )
        GROUP BY learnerHash
    ) USING (learnerHash)
    PREWHERE (courseId = 1) AND (onCourse = 0)
    WHERE (verb = 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/interacted') AND (eventTime <= passed) AND (diff > 0)
    ORDER BY eventTime DESC
    LIMIT 1 BY learnerHash
)
ORDER BY diff DESC
LIMIT 7, 126
```

But if you wrap this query in query like below, Clickhouse will throw error: Not found column learnerHash in block. There are only columns: diff

```sql
SELECT avg(diff)
FROM
(
    SELECT *
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            learnerHash,
            passed - eventTime AS diff
        FROM statements
        GLOBAL ANY INNER JOIN
        (
            SELECT
                learnerHash,
                argMax(eventTime, resultScoreRaw) AS passed
            FROM
            (
                SELECT
                    learnerHash,
                    eventTime,
                    resultScoreRaw
                FROM statements
                PREWHERE (courseId = 1) AND (onCourse = 0)
                WHERE (verb = 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/passed') AND (objectId = 'https://crmm.ru/xapi/courses/spp/1/1/0-1')
                ORDER BY eventTime ASC
            )
            GROUP BY learnerHash
        ) USING (learnerHash)
        PREWHERE (courseId = 1) AND (onCourse = 0)
        WHERE (verb = 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/interacted') AND (eventTime <= passed) AND (diff > 0)
        ORDER BY eventTime DESC
        LIMIT 1 BY learnerHash
    )
    ORDER BY diff DESC
    LIMIT 7, 126
)
```

But, if you add `count(learnerHash)` to query, then it works fine.

```sql
SELECT avg(diff), count(learnerHash)
FROM
(
    SELECT *
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            learnerHash,
            passed - eventTime AS diff
        FROM statements
        GLOBAL ANY INNER JOIN
        (
            SELECT
                learnerHash,
                argMax(eventTime, resultScoreRaw) AS passed
            FROM
            (
                SELECT
                    learnerHash,
                    eventTime,
                    resultScoreRaw
                FROM statements
                PREWHERE (courseId = 1) AND (onCourse = 0)
                WHERE (verb = 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/passed') AND (objectId = 'https://crmm.ru/xapi/courses/spp/1/1/0-1')
                ORDER BY eventTime ASC
            )
            GROUP BY learnerHash
        ) USING (learnerHash)
        PREWHERE (courseId = 1) AND (onCourse = 0)
        WHERE (verb = 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/interacted') AND (eventTime <= passed) AND (diff > 0)
        ORDER BY eventTime DESC
        LIMIT 1 BY learnerHash
    )
    ORDER BY diff DESC
    LIMIT 7, 126
)
```
