Title: Nested type LowCardinality cannot be inside Nullable type.
Description:
There is a difference in behavior between 22.3 and higher LTS version when it comes to the LowCardinality type.

Here are two reproducible examples that work in 22.3 but don't work in the above LTS versions (tried on 22.6, 22.8 and 22.10):

```
DROP TABLE test

create table test
(
Printer LowCardinality(String),
IntervalStart DateTime
)
engine = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY (hiveHash(Printer), toYear(IntervalStart))
ORDER BY (Printer, IntervalStart);

INSERT INTO test VALUES ('printer1', '2006-02-07 06:28:15');

SELECT Printer FROM test WHERE Printer='printer1';

Code: 43. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Nested type LowCardinality(String) cannot be inside Nullable type. (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)
```

The second example is:

```
SET allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types = 1;

create table test
(
Printer LowCardinality(UInt32),
IntervalStart DateTime
)
engine = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY (Printer % 128, toYear(IntervalStart))
ORDER BY (Printer, IntervalStart);

INSERT INTO test VALUES (10, '2006-02-07 06:28:15');

SELECT Printer FROM test WHERE Printer=10;

Code: 43. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Nested type LowCardinality(UInt32) cannot be inside Nullable type. (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)
```
