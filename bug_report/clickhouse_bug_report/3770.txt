Title: /32 mask opens access to any host
Description:
ClickHouse server version 18.14.18 revision 54409 (18.12.17 same thing)

configuration like this
`            <networks incl="networks" replace="replace">
                <ip>::1</ip>
                <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
                <ip>172.24.35.72/32</ip>
            </networks>
`
allows access from, for example, 172.24.41.201

If I remove '/32' from configuration, network acl starts to work as intended.

If I recall correctly, I did not observe such behavior before upgrading to 18.12.17 from some 1.1.54xx version.
