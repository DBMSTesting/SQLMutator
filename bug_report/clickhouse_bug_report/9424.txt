Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
When joining three or more tables, if not specify a table prefix for the columns, report **Missing columns** Exception

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
19.8.3.8, 20.1.4

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```sql
SELECT
    c1,
    c2,
    c3
FROM
(
    SELECT number AS c1
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1
) AS t1
INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT number AS c2
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1
) AS t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2
INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT number AS c3
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1
) AS t3 ON t1.c2 = t3.c3
```

**Expected behavior**
output values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
Received exception from server (version 20.1.4):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from clickhouse-server:9000. DB::Exception: Missing columns: '--t1.c2' 'c2' 'c1' while processing query: 'SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM (SELECT * FROM (SELECT number AS c1 FROM system.numbers LIMIT 10) AS t1 INNER JOIN (SELECT number AS c2 FROM system.numbers LIMIT 10) AS t2 ON `--t1.c1` = `--t2.c2`) ALL INNER JOIN (SELECT number AS c3 FROM system.numbers LIMIT 10) AS t3 ON `--t1.c2` = c3', required columns: 'c1' 'c2' 'c3' '--t1.c2', source columns: '--t2.c2' '--t1.c1', joined columns: 'c3'.
```

**Additional context**
The following statement works fine.

* join two tables
```
SELECT
    c1,
    c2
FROM
(
    SELECT number AS c1
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1
) AS t1
INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT number AS c2
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1
) AS t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2

┌─c1─┬─c2─┐

```

* columns with table prefix
```
SELECT
    t1.c1,
    t2.c2,
    t3.c3
FROM

    SELECT number AS c1
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1

    SELECT number AS c2

INNER JOIN

    SELECT number AS c3
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 1
) AS t3 ON t1.c1 = t3.c3
