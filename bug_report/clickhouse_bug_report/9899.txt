Title: Distributed with group by hostName - count() issue 
Description:
Checked on the build from current master branch.

That works:
```
SELECT 
    hostName() AS h, 
    count(x)
FROM distributed
GROUP BY h
```

That - not:
```
SELECT 
    hostName() AS h, 
    count()
FROM distributed
GROUP BY h;
```

prefer_localhost_replica changes the exception:
```
prefer_localhost_replica=0
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column hostName() in block. There are only columns: count(): While executing SourceFromInputStream. 

prefer_localhost_replica=1
Code: 8. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot find column `hostName()` in source stream. 
```
