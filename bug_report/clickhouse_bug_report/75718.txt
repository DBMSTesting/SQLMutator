Title: Bad "not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY keys" error
Description:
### Describe the bug

With the new analyzer enabled and `group_by_use_nulls = 1`, a grouped column from a ROLLUP inside an uncorrelated subquery gives the error:
```
DB::Exception: Column default.t0.c0 is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY keys
```
This error is wrong, and the query should run successfully.
