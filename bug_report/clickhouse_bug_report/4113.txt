Title: Multiple aliases to `date` column of MergeTree do not work
Description:
We are experiencing an issue with queries like this:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (d Date, z UInt32) ENGINE = MergeTree(d, (z), 1);

  WITH (d < '2018-01-01') AND (d < '2018-01-02') AS x
SELECT 1
  FROM t
 WHERE x;

Received exception from server (version 18.12.14):
Code: 1001. DB::Exception: Received from 127.0.0.1:9000. DB::Exception: std::bad_typeid.
```
The error appears when all of these conditions meet:
1. The table is powered by `MergeTree` (maybe other engines too, but at least not `Memory`)
2. The date column is not part of the primary key
3. You mention it multiple times in `WITH`
4. You use those aliases in `WHERE`
