Title: Scalar subquery result seems lost
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**
Scalar subquery result seems lost

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
20.4.5.36
* Which interface to use, if matters
CLI
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
CREATE TABLE tags (
    id String,
    seqs Array(UInt8),
    create_time DateTime DEFAULT now()
) engine=ReplacingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (id);

INSERT INTO tags(id, seqs) VALUES ('id1', [1,2,3]), ('id2', [0,2,3]), ('id1', [1,3]);

-- Following query gets error:
WITH
    (SELECT [0, 1, 2, 3]) AS arr1
SELECT arrayIntersect(argMax(seqs, create_time), arr1) AS common, id
FROM tags
WHERE id LIKE 'id%'
GROUP BY id;

Received exception from server (version 20.4.5):
Code: 486. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Scalar `16555676479797732872_12772364718123215817` doesn't exist (internal bug). 


-- Following query works:
WITH
    (SELECT [0, 1, 2, 3]) AS arr1
SELECT arrayIntersect(argMax(seqs, create_time), arr1) AS common, id
FROM tags
GROUP BY id;

```
