Title: Error occurs when conditional aggregation function with subquery is used
Description:
### Summary
Query from distributed table with aggregation using conditional aggregation function containing subquery from the same distributed table causes error when distributed_product_mode is 'local'. However, query looks correct.

### Steps to reproduce
Issue is reproducible for version 1.1.54370.
1. On cluster with at least 2 shards create DB using DDL:
```
create database bug_report

create table
  bug_report.test_table_sharded(
    date Date,
    text String,
    hash UInt64
  )
engine=MergeTree(date, (hash, date), 8192)

create table bug_report.test_table as bug_report.test_table_sharded 
engine=Distributed(bug_report_cluster, bug_report, test_table_sharded, hash)
```

2. Execute query:
```
SELECT
  text,
  uniqExactIf(hash, hash IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      hash
    FROM bug_report.test_table
  )) as counter
FROM bug_report.test_table
GROUP BY text
ORDER BY counter, text
SETTINGS distributed_product_mode = 'local'
```
### Result
Server aborts execution with exception:
```
[179] ClickHouse exception, code: 179, host: localhost, port: 8123; Code: 179, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Different expressions with the same alias _subquery1:
(SELECT DISTINCT hash FROM bug_report.test_table_sharded ) AS _subquery1
and
(SELECT DISTINCT hash FROM bug_report.test_table_sharded ) AS _subquery1
```
