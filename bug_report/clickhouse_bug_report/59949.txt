Title: ALTER TABLE can block the service start: default expression and column type are incompatible

By using `ALTER TABLE` it is possible to change the definition of a table in such a way that it makes it impossible to reattach it, which breaks server startup.

A minimized case with detach + attach (it's the same):

```
CREATE TABLE t_alias
(
    `a` String DEFAULT ''
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY tuple()
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

ALTER TABLE t_alias
    ADD COLUMN `quote_type` Int8 ALIAS toInt8(a);
```

```
DETACH TABLE t_alias;

ATTACH table t_alias;

Code: 32. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Attempt to read after eof: Cannot parse Int8 from String, because value is too short: While processing _CAST(toInt8(_CAST('' AS a_tmp_alter10672369618408891889, 'String') AS a) AS quote_type_tmp_alter3994543675784148909, 'Int8') AS quote_type: default expression and column type are incompatible.. (ATTEMPT_TO_READ_AFTER_EOF)
```

We shouldn't allow these `ALTER` commands if it's going to break the tables, as it won't appear until a reboot of the server happens.
