Title: Error using WITH when equality disjunction optimization is enable
Description:
**Description**
This is a bug on SQL query execution if an alias contains a condition that will be optimized.

For Eg 
```
match(field, 1) AND (field = '1' OR field = '2' OR field = '3')
```
will be optimized to 
```
match(field, 1) AND field IN ('1', '2, '3')
```

But if this expression is used in an alias, this will provoke an error

**How to reproduce this bug**
* this bug is present in at least versions 19.6.2 and 19.5.3 
```sql
CREATE TABLE test_bug_optimization (`path` String) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY path
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
The following alias will return an error:
```sql
WITH
  (path = 'test1') 
  OR match(path, 'test2')
  OR (match(path, 'test3') AND match(path, 'test2'))
  OR match(path, 'test4')
  OR (path = 'test5')
  OR (path = 'test6') AS alias_in_error
SELECT count(1)
FROM default.test_bug_optimization
WHERE alias_in_error
```

**Expected behavior**
```
┌─count(1)─┐
│        0 │
└──────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.011 sec. 
```


**Error message and/or stacktrace**

```
Received exception from server (version 19.6.2):
Code: 179. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Different expressions with the same alias alias_in_error:
match(path, 'test2') OR (match(path, 'test3') AND match(path, 'test2')) OR match(path, 'test4') OR alias_in_error AS alias_in_error
and
path IN ('test1', 'test5', 'test6') AS alias_in_error
```

**temporary fix to avoid the bug**
The bug can be avoided by disabling the optimizer with the setting optimize_min_equality_disjunction_chain_length

For eg: the same query with the setting gives the right result
```
WITH (path = 'test1') OR match(path, 'test2') OR (match(path, 'test3') AND match(path, 'test2')) OR match(path, 'test4') OR (path = 'test5') OR (path = 'test6') AS alias_in_error
SELECT count(1)
FROM default.test_bug_optimization 
WHERE alias_in_error
SETTINGS optimize_min_equality_disjunction_chain_length = 100

┌─count(1)─┐
│        0 │
└──────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.011 sec.
