Title: EXCHANGE TABLES not working on latest docker image
Description:
Using latest image in docker `yandex/clickhouse-server:latest`

Creating 2 identical tables Atomic db is default but also tried recreating but it isn't related because its an OS issue

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t1
(
    a DateTime64(3),
    b UInt8
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (a)
```
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t2
(
    a DateTime64(3),
    b UInt8
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (a)
```

Command `EXCHANGE TABLES t1 AND t2` returns:
```
Code: 1. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: System call renameat2() is not supported.
```

Suggestions?
