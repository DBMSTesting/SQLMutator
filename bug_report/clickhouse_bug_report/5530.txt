Title: Unnecessary reverse DNS request for remote_servers replica host
Description:
I am trying to build a simple 2 nodes cluster with replication. I want to use an internal network for internode communication. Each host has two network interfaces with "external" and "internal" address. Each CH instance listens only on the internal 192.168.108.x address.
host1: 
   ext_ip: 10.0.208.161
   int_ip: 192.168.108.1
host2:
  ext_ip: 10.0.208.139
  int_ip: 192.168.108.2
I mentioned these nodes in config.xml as follows:
```
<remote_servers>                                                                                                                                             
    <!-- One shard, two replicas -->

    </repikator>                                                                                                                                             
</remote_servers>

I created simple replicated table from documentation:
```
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
    EventDate DateTime,
    CounterID UInt32,
    UserID UInt32
) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/table_name', '{replica}')
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate)
ORDER BY (CounterID, EventDate, intHash32(UserID))
SAMPLE BY intHash32(UserID)
```
But when I added one record to this table on the host1, it didn't appear on the host2. In logs on host2 I got:
```
2019.06.04 14:25:12.905392 [ 36 ] {} <Warning> default.table_name (ReplicatedMergeTreePartCheckThread): Checking part 201906_0_0_0

2019.06.04 14:25:12.906631 [ 36 ] {} <Warning> default.table_name (ReplicatedMergeTreePartCheckThread): Found part 201906_0_0_0 on host1 that co
vers the missing part 201906_0_0_0

ReplicatedMergeTree::LogEntryPtr&)>: Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 111, e.displayText() = Connection refused, e.what() = Connection refused
```
It seems like CH found part on **host1**, not on 192.168.108.1! In my setup hostname `host1` resolves to external ip, i.e. `10.0.208.161`, not to internal ip 192.168.108.1. So I got `Connection refused` because there is not CH instance listened on this ip address as I mention in the beginning of this issue.

I tried to add lines to local `/etc/hosts` on host2:
```
192.168.108.1 host1
192.168.108.2 host2
```
I look deeper and tried to use `remote` function on host2:
1. `select * from remote('192.168.108.1', default.table_name)` return correct record as expected
2. `select * from remote('host1', default.table_name)` return correct record!!! 
But replication didn't work whatever. I tried
3. `select * from remote('host1.full.domain', default.table_name)` return "Connection refused"

It seems like CH resolves DNS names as operation system (i.e. Linux) using `search domain` from `/etc/resolv.conf` for replication purposes. But CH doesn't add `search domain` from `/etc/resolv.conf` for `remote` function.

In any way, why CH use the hostname instead of ip address which directly written in the configuration file?
