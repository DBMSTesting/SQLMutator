Title: Default timezone regression
Description:
After I upgraded to last master today (from an old version from sept 2018) I see at least on OSX that even if in `config.xml` I have `<timezone>UTC</timezone>` the server is using the system timezone which is `Europe/Bucharest`.

This can be tested as well using `SELECT timezone()`

Anything changed config wise in the last time ?
