Title: Deadlock in `WriteBufferFromS3::waitForAllBackGroundTasks`
Description:
This gets stuck:
```
INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3(..., 'CSV') PARTITION BY number SELECT * FROM numbers(3500)
```

where '...' is a url (with `{_partition_id}` wildcard in it) and access key.

For comparison, it works if we reduce 3500 to 3000:
```
INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3(..., 'CSV') PARTITION BY number SELECT * FROM numbers(3000)
```

This has something to do with the global thread pool size. With the following server settings:
```
max_thread_pool_size: 80
background_schedule_pool_size: 2
```
the query gets stuck with just `numbers(12)`.
