Title: MemoryTracker wrong total: Memory limit (total) exceeded, but no real usage
Description:
Simple SELECT query leads to **Memory limit (total) exceeded** due to wrong reporting by MemoryTracker (no real usage detected in top)

I execute a simple query (`select a from b where c = 1`) in one thread sequentially via HTTP:
```
for i in `seq 1 500`; do curl "http://ch:8123/?query=SELECT%20a%20FROM%20%60db%60.b%20WHERE%20c%3D1%20format%20JSON"; done;
```
It leads to this error in 15 seconds
DB data ~200mb compressed.
It consumes ~4MB per request and accumulates up to the 3.6GB limit. I see a continuous growth in MemoryTracker, which, if you do not stop the requests (or switch to other request), will not be reset.
But there is no real growth in the `top`.
Result contains 0 rows if it matters
Version **20.9.2.20** stable, in 20.6 and 20.8 it was the same.

Changing config  max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio is a dirty fix
