Title: T1 LEFT JOIN T2 (empty) ON true rewrite to CROSS JOIN bug
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**
ClickHouse rewrite LEFT join with ON 1 (or ON true) condition to CROSS JOIN, which is wrong if right table is empty.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
```

WITH table AS
    (
        SELECT 1 AS key
    )
SELECT *
FROM table AS T1
LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE false
) AS T2 ON 1

**Expected behavior**

Query will return data
