Title: Unable to use HDFS datasource in HA mode
Description:

**Describe the bug**
When HDFS is the datasource, it can't work on the HA mode. However the libhdfs3 can support HA mode.
For the example, if the the hdfs uri is some the like hdfs://ha/user/test.csv which doesn't contain port number, libhdfs should work on HA whe the uri doesn't contain any port number.
But the Clickhouse has some

**How to reproduce**
when using the HDFS as the datasource, if the uri doesn't contain port number, it will fail.


**Expected behavior**
If the HDFS uri doesn't contain port number, it should be work on HA, the uri will be used as the nameservice name, and it will find the real name node host and ip from the configuration file. 
the default configuration file in hdfs-client.xml on the working directory or it can be set from the environment variable "LIBHDFS3_CONF".
