Title: Issue with table alias in JOIN ON clause on distributed tables
Description:
ClickHouse version 18.14.15.
When using not distributed tables, the following query is OK:

SELECT 1 FROM system.columns T1 ALL INNER JOIN system.tables T2 ON (T1.table = T2.name) LIMIT 1

But when using distributed tables (or equivallent, using cluster() function):

 SELECT 1 FROM cluster('vscluster',system.columns) T1 ALL INNER JOIN cluster('vscluster',system.tables) T2 ON (T1.table = T2.name) LIMIT 1

The query fails with the following error:

Received exception from server (version 18.14.15):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:19000, ::1. DB::Exception: Unknown identifier: T1.table.
