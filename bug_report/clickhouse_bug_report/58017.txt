Title: Crash: datarace from DB::JoinedTables::resolveTables from complex materialized view(s)
Description:
Very complex schema with a lot of materialized views, which have JOINs, window functions, CTE etc. (please avoid doing that!). 

Mostly the pipeline works, but sometimes it crashes or hangs.

Failed (so far) to isolate the test case, but was able to reproduce the problem with tsan (recent master)
