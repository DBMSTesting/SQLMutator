Title: When windowFunnel has a large amount of data, the query conditions remain unchanged, and the query is repeated. The result set will change
Description:
When I query the funnel for a period of time, the event data filtering conditions of windowFunnel are many. The query results will have approximate values, is there any way to fix the query results

sql detail is :

select step_num, count(*) as user_count from(select e_device_id,windowFunnel(86400)(event_date_time, (event = 'start_dub_new'),(event = 'check_grade'),(event = 'member_center_browse' and  page_from = 'xxx'),(event = 'member_center_click' and  page_from = 'xxx' and  click_location = 'xx'),(event = 'purchase_result' and  is_success = 1)) as step_num from p_event_all where staticdate >= '2020-07-13' and staticdate <= '2020-07-19' /*e_os*//*e_app_version*//*e_manufacturer*/ group by e_device_id) a group by step_num order by step_num;
