Title: S3 storage credentials renewal error
Description:
I was trying the S3 storage feature for some time (with authentication enabled), at the beginning everything was right and I could read and write data to S3, but after some time the same exact queries were failing. After checking the logs I found some errors related to S3 authentication and it seems it is not able the renew the signature after it expires. 

Clickhouse version: 20.1.2
Query example:
```
INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://<endpoint>/<bucket>/<object>', '<access_key>', '<secret_key>', 'Native', 'ts UInt64') SELECT ts FROM default.<table>
```
Stack trace:
```

```

After some debugging, I could find out that that error does not happen when HTTP protocol is being used (it affects S3 and HTTPS)
