Title: clickhouse-client broken when using with readonly user and queries file
Description:
After upgrade of clickhouse-server and clickhouse-client to newest version (24.1.5.6), I encountered a BC break:

**Received exception from server (version 24.1.5):
Code: 164. DB::Exception: Received from xxx:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot modify 'log_comment' setting in readonly mode. (READONLY)**

It's impossible to use readonly user with queries file in clichouse-client:

`clickhouse-client -h host -u readonly_user --password pass --database database --queries-file /tmp/some_file_with_query.txt`

Probably introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57191.
