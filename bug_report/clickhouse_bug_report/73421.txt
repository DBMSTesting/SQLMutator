Title: New WildCard Grants shows similar named databases 
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

granting access to all tables of a database via
```
grant all to db.* to user
```
allows the user to see similar named databases such as `db_two` : 
```
select name  from system.databases
-> 
db
db_two
```

A first step for the reproduction of this issue in fiddle is 
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/08285a32-4db9-4e02-8651-86f67fa35e71

Unfortunatlly a user switch is not possible in one session, hence there is no easy reproduction within a fiddle.

Note: that access to this visiable database is restricted.
