Title: TTL doen't work with ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
TTL and ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree doesn't work 

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
```19.14.6.12```

* Which interface to use, if matters
```clickhouse-client```

* Non-default settings, if any
default settings in place 

* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
```
CREATE TABLE test.ht_repl ON CLUSTER 'one_shard_three_replicas' (
`cm_mac_address` String, 
`last_updated` DateTime, 
`cabinet` Nullable(String), 
`node` Nullable(String)) 
ENGINE = ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree('{zookeeper_path_prefix}/ht_repl', '{shard}', last_updated) 
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(last_updated) 
PRIMARY KEY cm_mac_address 
ORDER BY cm_mac_address 
TTL last_updated + toIntervalDay(1) 
```

* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/dbms/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
SELECT last_updated
FROM test.ht_repl
GROUP BY last_updated
ORDER BY last_updated ASC

┌────────last_updated─┐

└─────────────────────┘
```

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

The data was inserted a couple of days ago, I expect that it should be deleted automatically by schedule. 

```
SELECT last_updated
FROM test.ht_repl
GROUP BY last_updated
ORDER BY last_updated ASC

┌────────last_updated─┐
│ 2019-10-18 00:00:00 │
│ 2019-10-18 07:00:00 │
└─────────────────────┘
```

If I run manually, data will be deleted. 
```OPTIMIZE TABLE test.ht_repl FINAL```

```
SELECT last_updated
FROM test.ht_repl
GROUP BY last_updated
ORDER BY last_updated ASC

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 
```

Looks like there is an issue TTL with ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree and scheduler
