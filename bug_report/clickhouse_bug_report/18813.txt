Title: Running multi queries on distributed engine at the same time but show fatal message for VM environment
Description:
Hi Clickhouse Team,

I faced an issue in my test environment which is a virtual machine with 128GB memory. Cause our scenario is to get one aggregated result and four to five queries for map display. Those queries will be triggered at the same by GUI manipulate.
(Another points is that issues happened when queries go to **distributed** engine table.)

But I found Clickhouse was shut down by those queried sometimes. Currently, status are:

1. Shut down forever til systemctl restart Clickhouse 
2. Or temporarily showing Error 210.

Then I checked /var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.log and /var/log/clickhouse-server/fatal.log.

- I found two different kinds of log showing problem is about memory pointer.
- Should I do some settings to prevent these happened?
