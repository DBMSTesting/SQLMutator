Title: Ensure that all streams point to to_mark after the call to readRange() [#CLICKHOUSE-2775]
Description:
If for some array column all values in the block are empty, then reading from the data stream of this column is skipped. This means that the necessary seek for this stream is skipped and consequently it doesn't point to cur_mark_idx after calling readRange().

After this patch readData() for the data stream is called even if there are no rows to be read.
