Title: CH 18.14.18 - 19.1.6 Wrong query result DISTINCT + JOIN
Description:
ClickHouse server version 18.14.18
```

create table fooL (a Int64, v String) engine = Memory;
create table fooR (a Int64, v String) engine = Memory;
insert into fooL select number, 'L'||toString(number) from numbers(2);
insert into fooL select number, 'LL'||toString(number) from numbers(2);
insert into fooR select number, 'R'||toString(number) from numbers(2);

select distinct a from fooL any left outer join fooR using(a) order by a;

┌─a─┐
│ 0 │
│ 0 │
│ 1 │
│ 1 │
└───┘
```

**Correct Result (ClickHouse server version 1.1.54394)**

```
select distinct a from fooL any left outer join fooR using(a) order by a;
┌─a─┐
│ 0 │
│ 1 │
└───┘
```

**Workaround ClickHouse server version 18.14.18**
```
select  a from fooL any left outer join fooR using(a) group by a order by a
┌─a─┐
│ 0 │
│ 1 │
└───┘
```

Probably it's a duplicate for https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/3658 but I am not sure.

Initially I caught it with MergeTree.
