Title: Unexpected result when comparing `IN` expression and integer
Description:
> Please make sure that the version you're using is still supported (you can find the list [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/SECURITY.md#scope-and-supported-versions)).

> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

**Company or project name**

National University of Singapore

**Describe what's wrong**

Consider the following test cases. The third query should return one row in the table after join, since the second query shows that the `WHERE` condition is evaluated to 1, and thus the row should not be filtered.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t0;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;

CREATE TABLE t0(c0 INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY(c0)) ENGINE=MergeTree();
CREATE TABLE t1(c0 INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY(c0)) ENGINE=MergeTree();
INSERT INTO t0(c0) VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO t1(c0) VALUES (0);

SELECT * FROM t1, t0; -- 0 1
SELECT ((t0.c0 NOT IN (true))=(t1.c0/-1)) FROM t1, t0; -- 1
SELECT * FROM t1, t0 WHERE ((t0.c0 NOT IN (true))=(t1.c0/-1));
-- Expected: 0 1
-- Actual: Empty set
```

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

yes

**Expected behavior**

The third query returns the same as the first query.
