Title: DDL task queue is stuck
Description:
`select * from system.zookeeper where path = '/clickhouse/task_queue/ddl';`

The ddl task queue is full (1000 items). It is not processing though so items are stuck there forever now, they are in the queue 4 days already.

Is there a way to find what's wrong and fix it? Error log shows nothing (no errors), there are no long running queries and replication queue is empty.

Every other query with `ON CLUSTER` clause now fails on timeout, I guess it's because it doesn't fit into the queue.
