### Describe what's wrong

Counting the result table of nested EXCEPT query always return 0, even if the nested query actually returned results. 
I'm guessing other functionalities are affected by this issue, though I only encountered the outer count() issue so far.

version 24.9.3.128:
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/0ad6b295-c34c-4e4b-92d8-c2f92c6d862a
Wrong - returns count 0 even though the nested query return 1 record.

version 24.8.11:
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/e0e48f8c-f9a0-4cbe-b15a-0d8daf847299
Wrong - returns count 0 even though the nested query return 1 record.

version 23.7.6.111:

Correct - count is 1 as expected.
