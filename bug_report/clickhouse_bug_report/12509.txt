Title: Random server tcp connection failed
Description:

We use clickhouse version: 19.17.5.18
We have some application servers randomly failed to connect by tcp protocol but can connect via curl(curl 'http://10.2.3.153:8123/?query=SELECT%201). If use clickhouse-client to login it will show code:210. DB::NetException: connection reset by peer.

Our  clickhouse setting  most of parameters are the default except following 3 settings.
use_uncompressed_cache = 0 
load_balancing =In_order
max_memory_usage=50000000000


I also foud there has 32 queries which try to get data via distributed table to get data from other servers and it already process 45907 to 60916 seconds.  Each distributed table has 44 instance in cluster.

Is the stock queries  is a root cause to failed tcp connection?
Do I have any settings to avoid these queries stock in database?

Thank you
