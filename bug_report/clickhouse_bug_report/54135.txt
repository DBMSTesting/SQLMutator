When CH deletes detached part, `removeSharedRecursive` is called.
`removeSharedRecursive` work incorrect with the pathes from projection. The pathes from projection contain records like ``, there are several parts divided by '/'.

But the check inside  `removeSharedRecursive`, particularly inside `RemoveRecursiveObjectStorageOperation`, checks only last paths part with `filename()`.
