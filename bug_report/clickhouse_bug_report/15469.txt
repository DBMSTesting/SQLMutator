Title: [20.3] Dictionary DDL clickhouse table with dot doesn't work as dict source
Description:
**How to reproduce**
Clickhouse version 20.3.19.4
```
CREATE TABLE `test.txt`
(
    `key1` UInt32,
    `key2` UInt32,
    `value` String
)
ENGINE = Memory()

CREATE DICTIONARY test_dict
(
    `key1` UInt32,
    `key2` UInt32,
    `value` String
)
PRIMARY KEY key1, key2
SOURCE(CLICKHOUSE(HOST 'localhost' PORT 9000 USER 'default' TABLE `test.txt` PASSWORD '' DB 'default'))
LIFETIME(MIN 1 MAX 3600)
LAYOUT(COMPLEX_KEY_HASHED())

SYSTEM RELOAD DICTIONARY default.test_dict
Received exception from server (version 20.3.19):
Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9003. DB::Exception: Logical error: more than two components in table expression.
```

**Additional context**
It works in 20.4 and later versions.
