Title: The Decimal data type does not allow quotes when inserted with CSV format
Description:
SQL that reproduces the issue:

```
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    `key` UInt64, 
    `val` Decimal(15, 2)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY key

INSERT INTO t1 FORMAT CSV "1","1" -- this generates error
INSERT INTO t1 FORMAT CSV "1",1   -- this is OK
```
The Decimal data type should allow quotes like any other data type do.
