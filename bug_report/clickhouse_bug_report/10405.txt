Title: "Data compressed with different methods..." error
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Simple select queries produces "Data compressed with different methods..." exception. 

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use - 20.1.5 revision 54431
* The table was created from larger one by `CREATE TABLE default.tmp2 ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY oid AS SELECT oid, mag, catflags FROM table WHERE _part = 'all_72123_79580_5'`. `metadata/default/tmp2.sql` content:
```sql
ATTACH TABLE tmp2
(
    `oid` UInt64,
    `mag` Float32,
    `catflags` UInt16
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY oid
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
```
Original table has more rows and columns but crashes with the same error specifying that part. Original table was made from multiple instances of clickhouse-client using CSV format.
* `.tar.bz2`archive of `data/default/tmp2` can be [downloaded from Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15aUS1uUhh99HdZK2UpdFG_V2I8_3y97h/view?usp=sharing) (3.8GB compressed, 6.7GB uncompressed)
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```sql
SELECT min(mag)
FROM default.tmp2
```
```

For original table query with and without `WHERE` statement works differently:
```sql
SELECT min(mag)
FROM default.table
```
```

```sql

Specific aggregation function `min` doesn't matter, if no aggregation function is used, the result is the same.
