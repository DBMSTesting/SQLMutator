Title: Show tables command will take 2 quota count.
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**
Command suchs show tables/databases/processlist etc will take 2 quota count.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
version 20.13.3.3

**How to reproduce**
```
1. create quota

CREATE QUOTA q1 KEYED BY user_name FOR INTERVAL 1 minute MAX queries = 5 TO default

2. show current quota usage

select quota_name, end_time, queries, max_queries from system.quotas_usage;

┌─quota_name─┬────────────end_time─┬─queries─┬─max_queries─┐
│ q1         │ 2021-01-19 14:40:00 │       0 │           5 │

3. send show command
show tables;

4. show quota usage
┌─quota_name─┬────────────end_time─┬─queries─┬─max_queries─┐
│ q1         │ 2021-01-19 14:40:00 │       2 │           5 │
```

**Expected behavior**

* show tables/databases/processlist take 1 quota count
* show privileges take 0 quota count 

**Analysis**

Sqls such as show tables/databases/processlist/privileges will be interpreted to select sql, so will take another quota count.
