Title: [Text in Chinese, screenshots with bad typefaces] ck progress seems stuck ,table cann't merge and connected ,then a lot of close_wait
Description:
**Describe the bug**
I have a cluster consited of one distribute node and 2 shards 4 replicas.
I insert batch data into one os the replicas which is not leader at a speed about 80~130 million rows/secondã€‚abount 15 minutes later,the produce data progress can't insert data successfully,the error log shows too many parts because this replica doesn't merge data.At the same time ,this shard's leader replica merge data successfully.This replica'progress is alive but it seems struck. And  the clickhouse_client can't login in and the distribute query to the replica will be timeout and this replica has too many close_wait connections,
**How to reproduce**
It's hard to reproduce.I only meet several times in the past half year.You can test to insert into one of the replica at a very high speed.
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
20.1.6.30

**Expected behavior**
The  insert and merge of replica should work normally!

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
