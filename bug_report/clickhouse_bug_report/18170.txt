Title: `Move Partition To Table` will lost data
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Use `Move Partition To Table` to move data from tmp table to production table, some data will lost after moving

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
20.12.3.3
* Which interface to use, if matters
`Move Partition To Table`

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
Steps as below:  
1. insert data to tmp table and query count
```SQL
select count(*)
from tmp_table
where paritition_key=partition_val;
-- output: 82
```
2. drop old data and move partition to production table
```SQL
ALTER TABLE prod_table DROP PARTITION partition_val;
ALTER TABLE tmp_table MOVE PARTITION partition_val TO TABLE prod_table;
```

3. query count
```SQL
select count(*)
from prod_table
where paritition_key=partition_val;
-- output: 69
```

**Expected behavior**
after moving data to production table, the record count should be same as before.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
not any error messages...

**Additional context**
1. Table create statement sample as below: 
```SQL
│ CREATE TABLE xxxx_campaign_info
(
    `id` UInt32,
    `advertiser_id` String,
    `campaign_id` String,
    `name` String,
    `budget` Float64,
    `budget_mode` String,
    `landing_type` String,
    `status` String,
    `modify_time` String,
    `campaign_type` String,
    `campaign_create_time` DateTime,
    `campaign_modify_time` DateTime,
    `create_time` DateTime,
    `update_time` DateTime
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY advertiser_id
ORDER BY campaign_id
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192 │
```
> tmp_table has the exactly same schema with prod_table, just different table name.

2. Tried with `Replace Partition`, which works as expected
