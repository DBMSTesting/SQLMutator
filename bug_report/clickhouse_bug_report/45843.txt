Title: word boundary regex extraction seems working incorrect
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

I'm trying to extract the first letter from each word in a string
I test my regex in https://regex101.com/ and it works correctly

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
I'm unable to try the latest release unfortunately

ClickHouse server version used is 22.8.8.3

**How to reproduce**
```
SELECT extractAll('new york is the greatest', '\\b(\\w)') t;
SELECT extractAll('new york is the greatest', '(\\b[a-zA-Z])') t;
```


**Expected behavior**
It should return first letter of each word, but I get a String array with each letter in a String instead.
Or maybe I'm using it wrong?
