Title: max_execution_time does not work when filtering a distributed table
Description:
In this example fact_event is a distributed table built over fact_event_shard.
A query from fact_event_shard with a filter gets interrupted.
A query from fact_event with no filter gets interrupted.
A query from fact_event with a filter continues to run.
```
:) select * from system.settings where name='max_execution_time'

┌─name───────────────┬─value─┬─changed─┐
│ max_execution_time │ 10    │       1 │
└────────────────────┴───────┴─────────┘

:) SELECT uniq(user_key) FROM fact_event WHERE hash > 0

→ Progress: 102.27 billion rows, 1.64 TB (1.41 billion rows/s., 22.48 GB/s.) 40%
Cancelling query.
Ok.
