Title: Materialized column not visible in the right table of a LEFT JOIN
Description:
Materialized column not visible in the right table of a LEFT JOIN.

Tested on 21.10.2.15

Create the following example data:
```
create table test1(col UInt64, col_sq UInt64 MATERIALIZED col*col) Engine=MergeTree partition by tuple() order by tuple();
insert into test1 values (1),(2);

create table test2(col UInt64) Engine=MergeTree partition by tuple() order by tuple();
insert into test2 values (1),(2);
```

Execute the following:
```
SELECT t1.col, t1.col_sq
FROM test2 t2
LEFT JOIN test1 t1 ON t1.col = t2.col;
```

Observe the exception:
```
Received exception from server (version 21.10.2):
Code: 8. DB::Exception: Received from 127.0.0.1:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot find column `col_sq` in source stream, there are only columns: [t1.col]. (THERE_IS_NO_COLUMN)
```

Expected:
The query succeeds.

Workaround (thanks Denny Crane):
```SELECT t1.col, t1.col_sq
FROM test2 t2
LEFT JOIN (SELECT col, col_sq FROM test1) t1 ON t1.col = t2.col;
```

Workaround result:
```
┌─t1.col─┬─col_sq─┐
│      1 │      1 │
│      2 │      4 │
└────────┴────────┘
```
