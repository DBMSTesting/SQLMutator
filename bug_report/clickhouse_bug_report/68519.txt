Title: [mannWhitneyUTest] The implementation of the class ConcatenatedSamples might not be correct.
Description:
I can see no reason to use '%' instead of '-' in the operator[] of ConcatenatedSamples. Particularly when the size of second sample is larger than the first one, the output of this function appears to be a random number.
