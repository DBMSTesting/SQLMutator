**Additional context**

Not always occurs. 
But ...
We found that the ZooKeeper DDL queue length has exceeded 1000 (hard coded?).
But when I change the `max_tasks_in_queue` by setting the parameter below:
```xml
<yandex>
   <distributed_ddl>
      <max_tasks_in_queue>
```
it seems not take effects. Is the exception related to this item?
