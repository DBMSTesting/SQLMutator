Title: Non-existent columns are returned on joins
Description:
I'm trying to run the following query on ClickHouse server version 19.13.3 revision 54425:

```sql
SELECT l.a, l.c FROM (
    SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS b
) AS l join (
    SELECT 2 AS b, 3 AS c
) AS r
USING b
```

I expect to get an error `Missing columns: 'c' while processing query`. However, instead of this error the server returns

```
┌─a─┬─c─┐
│ 1 │ 3 │
└───┴───┘
```
