Title: Long running Distributed DDL fail with `Cannot execute replicated DDL query on leader`
Description:
Hello,

I'm running into the following issue with some Distributed DDL queries, ie ALTER MODIFY COLUMN which are long running due to the need of rewriting data. They fail with `Cannot execute replicated DDL query on leader` error, but they don't have to.

The issues is here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/Clickhouse/blob/42b8ed3ec64d7077422afb898db174edf6c191b0/src/Interpreters/DDLWorker.cpp#L776 replicas wait only 20 seconds (20 tries with 1 second sleep after each) when checking the status of the migration, since those migrations are taking longer than that it fails with the above mentioned error.

Maybe we should wait as long as the execution lock is held by the a leader instead?

Example query:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test
    ON CLUSTER 'test'
    MODIFY COLUMN float_as_uint UInt16;
```

Note: I'm testing this on v19 but I believe current master is affected as well.
