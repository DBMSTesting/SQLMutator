Title: Unexpected sort result on multi columns with nulls first direction
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Unexpected sort result on multi columns with nulls first direction

Reproducerï¼šhttps://fiddle.clickhouse.com/6cf10cbb-aa70-4956-898b-c09ed8b3e177
The order of third column is unexpected.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes

**How to reproduce**

It can be reproduced on recent release. According the source code, it is supposed to be reproduced on every release.

**Expected behavior**

As reproducer shown, for a table `nulls_first_sort_test` with structure `a Nullable(Int32), b Nullable(Int32), c Nullable(Int32)`
and following data
```
5	\N	2
5	\N	1
5	\N	7
5	\N	3
5	7	4
5	7	6
5	7	2
5	7	1
5	7	3
5	7	9
5	1	4
5	1	6
5	1	2
5	1	1
5	1	3
5	1	9
```
The result of SQL `SELECT * FROM nulls_first_sort_test ORDER BY a NULLS FIRST,b NULLS FIRST,c NULLS FIRST LIMIT 5` is unexpected
```
5	\N	3
5	\N	7
5	\N	1
5	\N	2
5	1	1
```
It's obviously that the order of third column is unexpected.
