Title: Clickhouse takes a large amount of virtual memory when running kafka data input.
Description:
OS version: Redhat 7
Clickhouse version: 19.3.5
total physical mem: 250G
I created the data input stream using the way in docs(kafka topic mapped table, materialized view and mergetree result table). It have run for 4 days, and I find the clickhouse-server process takes about 236G virtual memory and 15G physical memory.
