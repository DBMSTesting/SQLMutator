Title: Remote Postrges columns are not mapped correctly during a JOIN with a WHERE condition
Description:
When creating a JOIN with a CH and PG table, the column from the where section is incorrectly mapped to the  PG column.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**
Doesn't happen in 24.1.1.2048 , reproduces still in 24.5.1.1763

**How to reproduce**
Create a simple table in PG with an "id" field:
```
CREATE TABLE test.pg_table (
	id int4 NULL
 );
```
Create a remote:
```
CREATE TABLE test.pg_table_remote AS postgresql(
pg_connection, 
schema = 'test',
 `table` = 'pg_table');
```
Create a simple CH table that also has an "id" field:
```
CREATE TABLE ch_table
(
	`id` String,
	`remote_pg_id` Int32,
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY tuple();
```
Now when we try to join them and add a WHERE clause to the id field:
```
SELECT *
FROM ch_table
JOIN pg_table_remote ON ch_table.remote_pg_id = pg_table_remote.id
WHERE ch_table.id = 'Test'
```
The system maps the ch_table.id to the postgres id field and gives a type mismatch error 
```
SQL Error [1002] [07000]: std::exception. Code: 1001, type: pqxx::data_exception, e.what() = 
ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type integer: "Test"
LINE 1: ...LECT "id" FROM "test"."pg_table" WHERE "id" = 'Test') ...
```

Another example:
```
SELECT *
FROM ch_table
JOIN pg_table_remote ON ch_table.remote_pg_id = pg_table_remote.id
WHERE ch_table.id = '1231231321321321321'
```
Gives:
```
SQL Error [1002] [07000]: std::exception. Code: 1001, type: pqxx::data_exception, e.what() =
ERROR:  value "1231231321321321321" is out of range for type integer
LINE 1: ...LECT "id" FROM "test"."pg_table" WHERE "id" = '123123132...
```
