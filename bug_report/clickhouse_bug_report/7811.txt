Title: Got protobuf corrupted for kafka engine
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
After creating table with kafka engine, I've got protobuf corrupted.
I checked with another consumer and protobuf is correct.

**How to reproduce**
Put this to /var/lib/clickhouse/format_schemas/md.proto
```
syntax = "proto3";             
                        
message mddata {
    int64 ts = 1;
    string instrument_id = 2;
    string exchange = 3;
    repeated double bid_sizes = 4;
    repeated double bid_prices = 5; 
    repeated double ask_sizes = 6;
    repeated double ask_prices = 7; 
}

```
Then create table 
```
create table kafka (   ts Int64,  `instrument_id` String, `exchange` String, `bid_sizes` Array(Float64), `bid_prices` Array(Float64), `ask_sizes` Array(Float64), `ask_prices` Array(Float64) ) ENGINE=Kafka('127.0.0.1:9092', 'mddata', 'mygroup', 'Protobuf', '', 'md:mddata');
```
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
ClickHouse client version 19.11.2.7 (official build).

* Sample data for all these tables, 

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
select * from kafka limit 1
**Expected behavior**
I expected to see a row

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
Code: 444. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Protobuf messages are corrupted or don't match the provided schema. Please note that Protobuf stream is length-delimited: every message is prefixed by its length in varint..
