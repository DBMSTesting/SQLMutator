Title: FULL JOIN with table with LowCardinality() field leads to Memory limit exceeded exception
Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
FULL JOIN of N tables/selects with `LowCardinality(String)` field fails with `Memory limit (for query) exceeded`.

**How to reproduce**
Clickhouse-server 19.15.2.2

**Tables setup**

```
CREATE TABLE foo (a String, b String, int_column UInt8) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY (a, b) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
```

```
CREATE TABLE bar (a LowCardinality(String), b LowCardinality(String), int_column UInt8) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree(int_column) ORDER BY (a, b) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
```
**Insert some values**
```
INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('a', 'b', 1)
```
```
INSERT INTO bar VALUES ('a', 'b', 1), ('a', 'c', 2)
```

**Queries to run that lead to unexpected result**
```
SELECT foo.a, foo.b, foo.int_column, bar.a, bar.b, bar.int_column FROM foo FULL JOIN bar ON foo.a = bar.a AND foo.b = bar.b;
```

**Expected behavior**
FULL JOIN query returns data from both tables with empty values on the places where there's data in the left table but not in the right and vice versa. 

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
Received exception from server (version 19.15.2):
Code: 241. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Memory limit (for query) exceeded: would use 128.00 TiB (attempt to allocate chunk of 140737488361760 bytes), maximum: 9.31 GiB.
```

**Additional context**
The query works good if without `LowCardinality()` fields or with `CAST(column as String)`.
