Title: Analyzer: distributed query with IN in the SELECT section
Description:
### Company or project name

_No response_

### Describe what's wrong

A condition with IN complains about the expression on the left side in a distributed query.
No exception without analyzer.
```
SELECT toDayOfWeek(toDateTime(0) + uid)
FROM cluster(default, default.users);

   +-toDayOfWeek(~e(0), uid))-+
1. |                        4 |
   +--------------------------+

SELECT toDayOfWeek(toDateTime(0) + uid) in (7)
FROM cluster(default, default.users)
settings enable_analyzer=0;

   +-in(toDayOfWe~, uid)), 7)-+
1. |                        0 |
   +--------------------------+

SELECT toDayOfWeek(toDateTime(0) + uid) in (7)
FROM cluster(default, default.users);

Received exception from server (version 25.2.1):
