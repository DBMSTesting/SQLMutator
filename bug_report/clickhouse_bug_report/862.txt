Title: Adding 'order by' to single row constant query results in no rows
Description:

    Connected to ClickHouse server version 1.1.54236.

    :) SELECT a FROM ( SELECT 0 AS a);

    ┌─a─┐
    │ 0 │
    └───┘

    1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 

Now adding an order by.
 
    :) SELECT a FROM ( SELECT 0 AS a)
    ORDER BY a;

    Ok.

    0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 

If there is more than one row, it works ok.

    :) SELECT a
    FROM ( SELECT 0 AS a union all select 1 as a)
    ORDER BY a;

    ┌─a─┐
    │ 0 │
    │ 1 │
    └───┘

If inner query is not a constant, it works ok:

    :) SELECT a
    FROM (select number a from system.numbers limit 1)
    order by a;

    ┌─a─┐
    │ 0 │
    └───┘
