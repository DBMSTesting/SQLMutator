Title: Docker entrypoint script try to chown '.' if log path is not set in config
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Docker entrypoint script try to chown '.' if log path is not set in config because LOG_DIR = $(dirname "" || true) returns '.'

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
21.3.3.14

**How to reproduce**
Remove logger.log or logger.errorlog from config.xml. 

**Expected behavior**
The docker container should start without trying to chown '.', which resolves to / since the entrypoint script is located at /.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 0, e.displayText() = Not found: logger.log (version 21.3.3.14 (official build))

**Additional context**
I believe this bug was introduced by https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/18954 where the $LOG_PATH is surrounded with double quotes ("").
