Title: Bug in ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION ... ON CLUTER
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Introduced in https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/commit/f47e3292e1c08e3bd24007e8a9b54aa82158860a .
Bug reproduces if the query has been executed on follower replica before leader replica. It seems to me like the main problem is https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/master/dbms/src/Interpreters/DDLWorker.cpp#L668 because this flag is actually unused https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/master/dbms/src/Interpreters/DDLWorker.cpp#L743. Logic of this function seems strange and I think the good fix is implementation of separate queue for leader tasks https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/master/dbms/src/Storages/StorageReplicatedMergeTree.cpp#L3946.
