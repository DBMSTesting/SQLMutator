Title: `h3ToGeo` returns reversed `(lat, lon)`
Description:
Issue [h3ToGeoBoundary returns result which is different from documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs/issues/3031) points out that the return of `h3ToGeoBoundary` function is inconsistent with the behaviour of the function. This is corrected in #74278.

However looks that in the code `h3ToGeo` returns `(longitude, latitude)` but `h3ToGeoBoundary` returns `(latitude, longitude)`. The functions should behave the same as the standard order for geographic coordinates is `latitude, longitude`, unless there is a specific reason to have them switched for this function.

-  The standard order for geographic coordinates is `latitude, longitude` so we need to switch parameter ordering for `h3ToGeo`.
 -  A compatibility setting (similar to the many compatability settings for [formatDateTime](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions#formatdatetime)) should also be added so that existing usage is not broken unintentionally.
