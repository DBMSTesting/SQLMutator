Title: 19.1.10 cannot drop database with engine=Dictionary if it is not empty
Description:
I haven't noticed this before. I could drop and create a database with engine=Dictionary as many times as I wanted. Now it only allows to drop this database when there are no dictionaries (the database is empty).
```
:) drop database dict

DROP DATABASE dict

Received exception from server (version 19.1.10):
Code: 48. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: DatabaseDictionary: removeTable() is not supported.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.088 sec.
```
The definition of the database:
```
$ cat /var/lib/clickhouse/metadata/dict.sql
ATTACH DATABASE dict
ENGINE = Dictionary
```
