Title: merge_with_ttl_timeout trigger should clean all expired parts
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Only drop single partition is dropped per merge_with_ttl_timeout period. Other expired partitions stays there. 

**How to reproduce**
* Version: 20.3.8.53
* Setting: 
--  ttl_only_drop_parts=1 
-- system.part_log is on
* create any table partitioned table load data into. Wait for timeout TTL and observe parts changes from system.part_log table.

**Expected behavior**
It should drop whole expired parts once it checks for TTL. 

**Additional context**
As workaround 'ALTER TABLE events MATERIALIZE TTL' command is run, it triggers to remove parts.
