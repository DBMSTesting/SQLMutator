Title: Select from Merge table (over MergeTree and Buffer) with two or more clauses in the Where throws exception
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Select from Merge table, which works with MergeTree table and Buffer table above MergeTree table, with two or more clauses in the Where, throws exception.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

v22.3.2.2-lts
v22.3.3.44-lts
v22.3.4.20-lts
v22.3.5.5-lts

(every 22.3 lts version)

**How to reproduce**

Use ClickHouse server 22.3.5.5 version.

```sql
-- create tables
create table mt1 (f1 Int32, f2 Int32) engine = MergeTree() order by f1;

create table mt2 as mt1 engine = MergeTree() order by f1;
create table b as mt1 engine = Buffer(currentDatabase(), mt2, 16, 1, 1, 10000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000);

create table m as mt1 engine = Merge(currentDatabase(), '^(mt1|b)$');

-- insert some data
insert into mt1 values(1, 1), (2, 2);
insert into b   values(3, 3), (4, 4);

-- do select
select f1, f2
from m
where f1 = 1 and f2 = 1
```

Select throws exception:
```
Code: 44. DB::Exception: Cannot convert column `equals(f1, 1)` because it is non constant in source stream but must be constant in result. (ILLEGAL_COLUMN) (version 22.3.5.5 (official build))
```

The interesting part that no exceptions are thrown if the Where has only one clause:
```sql
select f1, f2
from m
where f1 = 1

-- f1|f2|
-- --+--+
--  1| 1|

select f1, f2
from m
where toUInt8(f1 = 1 and f2 = 1)

-- f1|f2|
-- --+--+
--  1| 1|
```

It's tested that type of column and function in the Where do not matter.

**Expected behavior**

Select completes without exceptions.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

Code: 44. DB::Exception: Cannot convert column `equals(f1, 1)` because it is non constant in source stream but must be constant in result. (ILLEGAL_COLUMN)

**Additional context**

There is no such problem in v21.8.15.7-lts.
