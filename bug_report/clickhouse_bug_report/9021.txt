Title: The order of params inside SELECT query bug(?)
Description:
Should the order of params effect on a select query?

```
SELECT *, hostName(), 8000 as port FROM remote('host:8000', system, query_log, 'default', '')

__Some correct output here__
```


```
SELECT hostName(), 8000 as port, * FROM remote('host:8000', system, query_log, 'default', '')
