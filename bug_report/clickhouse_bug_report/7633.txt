Title: Unexpected behavior of toDate() function
Description:
I experience unexpected behavior from `toDate()` function when applied to dates that does not exist.

**Actual behavior**
```
:) select toDate('2019-06-31')
2019-07-01
:) select toDate('2019-06-32')
0000-00-00
```

**Expected behavior**

Unexpected behavior in first case may lead to bugs that will be very hard to debug. If we use `0000-00-00` as invalid result from `toDate()` function, then why it does not cover the first query?

I know there were other issues related to unexpected behavior of `toDate()` function, but I didn't find the same or similar to this one.
