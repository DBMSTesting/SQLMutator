Title: clickhouse-client waiting forever after server restart
Description:
Hi :

I met a bug . when the sever restart . the clickhouse-client waiting for response will wait forever . I think it is cool if the client maybe throws connecting failed exception .

And the clickhouse version is 18.14.13.

hope your response. thanks.
