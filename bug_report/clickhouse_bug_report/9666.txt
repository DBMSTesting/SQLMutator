Title: HTTP interface INSERT atomicity bug
Description:
**Describe the bug**
HTTP interface INSERT does not distinguish between EOF and unexpected EOF (connection lost/etc.).
HTTP POST with `Content-Length`  - rows are inserted even if less than  `Content-Length` bytes have been received.
HTTP POST with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`  - rows are inserted even if zero-length chunk  hasn't been received.

**This makes it impossible to rely on block deduplication** with `Replicated*MergeTree` because  ClickHouse will still form a block (with less rows than intended) even if the connection is lost before receiving all of the data.

**How to reproduce**
`create table values(value Int64) engine = Log()`

For chunked encoding:
```
# send 10 rows per second.
$ (echo 'insert into values format CSV';  seq 100) | pv -lbar -L10 | curl -s  localhost:8123 -X POST -T -
Ctrl-C after few seconds
```
This will close the connection without sending the last zero-length chunk.
The rows will still be inserted though

**Expected behavior**
ClickHouse does not insert rows when an unexpected EOF observed

**Additional context**
Looks like  Poco's `HTTPChunkedStreamBuf` and `HTTPFixedLengthStreamBuf` just don't handle this.
