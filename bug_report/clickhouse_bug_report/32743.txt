Title: Inconsistent table names Error where having left join both inside & outside a view function
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

When having left join both inside & outside a view function, it will raise Inconsistent table names Error

> A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use

ClickHouse server version 21.11.6 revision 54450

* Which interface to use, if matters
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved

````
create table distributor (id String, name String)　Engine=MergeTree() Order By id;
create table product (id String, name String)　Engine=MergeTree() Order By id;

create table sales (id String, distributor String, product String, amount Float32) Engine=MergeTree() Order By id;
````

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

````sql
SELECT *
FROM view(
    SELECT *
    FROM sales
    LEFT JOIN distributor ON distributor.id = sales.distributor
) AS newSales
LEFT JOIN product ON product.id = newSales.product
````

**Expected behavior**

query successfully executed

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

Received exception from server (version 21.11.6):
Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Inconsistent table names: While processing SELECT * FROM sales LEFT JOIN distributor ON distributor.id = sales.distributor. 


**Additional context**

the query will successfully executed If i put both left join clause inside the view function. Same as both outside the view function.
but for some reason, i cannot do that.
