Title: Union distinct wrapped in a view returns only first part of the union
Description:
```sql
create or replace view v_test as (
	select 1 as a
	union distinct
	select 2 as a
	union distinct
	select 3 as a
	union distinct
	select 4 as a
	union distinct
	select 5 as a
)
	
 select * from v_test
```

Returns only one row. No problem with union all.
