Title: Predicate push-down doesn't respect WITH FILL in the inner query
Description:

**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**

```
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT startOf15MinInterval
	FROM (
		SELECT toDateTime('2019-11-14 22:15:00') startOf15MinInterval
		UNION ALL
		SELECT toDateTime('2019-11-15 01:15:00') startOf15MinInterval
		)
	ORDER BY startOf15MinInterval
	WITH fill step 900
	)
where startOf15MinInterval < toDateTime('2019-11-15 00:15:00')
```

returns a single row, and it should return all rows less then 2019-11-15 00:15:00.
