Title: Bad comparison of IPv6 to String: toIPv6('::1') != '::1'
Description:
```
:) select toIPv6('::1') = '::1'

┌─equals(toIPv6('::1'), '::1')─┐
│                            0 │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

Not sure what's going on. It does some implicit cast, but somehow casts to a wrong type? I would expect an error about implicit cast since we don't do them often, or at least that they compare as equal.
