Title: count(*) incorrect value with IN clause
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**
When querying a datetime64 keyed table it is possible to correctly query a row count with literal value filters on individual fields but when providing the literals within an `IN` clause the output is incorrect.

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
clickhouse-server:23.3.13.6 inside a docker container
* Which interface to use, if matters
I don't believe it matters, I was using HTTP
* Non-default settings, if any
None

```
CREATE TABLE events
(
    `dt` DateTime64(6, 'UTC'),
    `type` Int32,
    `event` Nullable(String)
)
    ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY (type, toStartOfWeek(dt))
TTL toDateTime(dt) + INTERVAL 2 DAY
-- order by is the non-unique PK
ORDER BY dt;

INSERT INTO events
SELECT
    toDateTime64('2022-12-12 12:00:00', 6) - (((12 + randPoisson(12)) * 60)),
     floor(randUniform(5, 100)),
    [null, '200', '404', '502'][toInt32(randBinomial(4, 0.1)) + 1]
FROM numbers(50_000_000);

-- find a dt and type pair with > 1 rows
select *, toUnixTimestamp64Nano(dt) from events where dt = '2022-12-12T11:24:00' and type = 86;
-- 19 rows for me locally

select *
from events
where dt = '2022-12-12T11:24:00' and type = 86;
-- 19

select count(*)
from events
where dt = '2022-12-12T11:24:00' and type = 86;
-- 19

select count(*)
from events
where (type, dt) in (86, '2022-12-12T11:24:00');
-- 18576

-- works with the experimental analyzer
Set allow_experimental_analyzer = 1;

select count(*)
from events
where (type, dt) in (86, '2022-12-12T11:24:00');
-- 19
```

**Expected behavior**
the count output should remain the same in both cases
