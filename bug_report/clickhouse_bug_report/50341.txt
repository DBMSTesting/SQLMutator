Title: Truncate fails to remove part from zookeeper
Description:
Truncate removes the part locally but fails to remove from zookeeper (could be due to any issue on keeper like connection lost). 
After restarting server, this causes clickhouse to read the part from zookeeper and report it as 'part lost forever'.
