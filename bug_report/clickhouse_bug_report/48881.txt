Title: Query with offset on order field produces incorrect results
Description:
Wrong: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/8ab418b6-60ab-458f-933f-2135bc09ce94
Right: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/5ddb78c9-d5ca-440c-b1c5-dc022991e198

SQL to produce the wrong result
```
create database temp;
create table temp.testoffset Engine=MergeTree partition by toStartOfMonth(day) order by day as select toDate('2022-01-01')+number as day from system.numbers limit 1000;

SELECT count()
FROM
(
    SELECT *
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            *,
            day + 365 AS day
        FROM
        (
            SELECT *
            FROM temp.testoffset
        )
    )
)
WHERE (day >= '2023-01-01') AND (day <= '2023-04-17');

SELECT count()
FROM
(
    SELECT
        *,
        day + 365 AS day
    FROM
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM temp.testoffset
    )
)
WHERE (day >= '2023-01-01') AND (day <= '2023-04-17');
```

SQL to produce the "right" result (workaround by changing the order key):

```
create database temp;
create table temp.testoffset Engine=MergeTree partition by toStartOfMonth(day) order by toString(day) as select toDate('2022-01-01')+number as day from system.numbers limit 1000;

SELECT count()
FROM
(
    SELECT *
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            *,
            day + 365 AS day
        FROM
        (
            SELECT *
            FROM temp.testoffset
        )
    )
)
WHERE (day >= '2023-01-01') AND (day <= '2023-04-17');

SELECT count()
FROM
(
    SELECT
        *,
        day + 365 AS day
    FROM
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM temp.testoffset
    )
)
WHERE (day >= '2023-01-01') AND (day <= '2023-04-17');
```
