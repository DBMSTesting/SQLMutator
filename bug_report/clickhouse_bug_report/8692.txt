Title: 'Size of offsets doesn't match size of column' for Enum/Int with Array Join
Description:
```
 CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS temp
 CREATE TABLE temp.test (
  `id` Nullable(String),
  `status` Nullable(Enum8('NEW' = 0, 'CANCEL' = 1)),
  `nested.nestedType` Array(Nullable(String)),
  `partition` Date
) ENGINE = MergeTree() PARTITION BY partition
ORDER BY
  partition SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
```
  
`INSERT INTO temp.test VALUES ('1', 'NEW', array('a', 'b'), now())`

I try to execute such query:
```
SELECT
    status,
    count() AS all
FROM temp.test ARRAY JOIN nested as nestedJoined 
WHERE (status IN (
    SELECT status
    FROM temp.test ARRAY JOIN nested as nestedJoined 
    GROUP BY status 
    ORDER BY count() DESC 
    LIMIT 10)) AND (id IN ('1', '2'))
GROUP BY CUBE(status)
LIMIT 100
```

But it throws an exception:  
Code: 9, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Size of offsets doesn't match size of column. (version 19.17.6.36 (official build))

This only happens in subquery for Enum/Int columns with ARRAY JOIN in FROM clause.
