Title: ReplicatedMergeTreePartCheckThread fails to schedule a fetch for a broken part
Description:
The problem started to appear after CH was upgraded from 18.14.19 to 19.7.3.

A part was merged successfully on June 25.
```
2019.06.25 07:17:53.849397 [ 9 ] {} <Trace> (Data): Renaming temporary part tmp_merge_201906_7424_8229_5 to 201906_7424_8229_5.
```
On June 26 it gets checked, and there is a problem:
```

The thread tries to schedule a fetch, but fails:
```

```
Then another thread checks this part and moves it into the 'detached' folder.
```

```
`system restart replica` makes CH download the missing part.
