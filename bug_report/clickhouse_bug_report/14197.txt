Title: tmp_fetch_XXX folder prevents the replica from recovering from a failed fetchPart attemp
Description:

**Describe the bug**
While using quorum replication, one of shards was found in a state when quorum was not being achieved because 3 replicas out of 4 were reporting the same error:
```
"Directory tmp_fetch_XXX already exists."
```

 which is thrown here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Storages/MergeTree/DataPartsExchange.cpp#L340

After manually removing this temp folder on one of the replicas the replica has successfully downloaded the missing part and has caught up.

Looking at the code closely, once this temp dir is created there seems to be no code path that would remove it.
In several other places in the same function, there is 
```
disk->removeRecursive(part_download_path);
throw ...
```
kind of code that clears up the temp opening up a path for successful retry. But in the case above retries will fail forever.
