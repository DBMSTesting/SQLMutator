Title: Missing data after merge from Buffer table
Description:
Hello!

Faced the issue, when my data, that I've inserted into a buffer table, disappeared after merge to main table.
I have a few instances, that are collecting data and inserting it to buffer table. Each instance has its own buffer and performs insert query after buffer reaches some limit (currently 1000 rows).

I use http interface with format JSONCompactEachRow.
I am also writing a log with query data and clickhouse response. I have got no errors and every time response is 200.
I have also made some SELECT queries from buffer table, and get all my inserted info, but after merge SELECT from main table did not show newly inserted rows.

I faced the issue on the version 21.1
After update to 21.6.5.37 nothing changed, data continues to disappear.

**How to reproduce**

Version:  21.6.5.37
Tables:

create table myDB.TestTable
(
    Timestamp      DateTime64(6),
    Name              LowCardinality(String),
    Quantity          UInt32,
    Price          Decimal(14, 7),
    City             LowCardinality(String),
    Code          UInt64,
    Source       LowCardinality(String)
)
    engine = MergeTree PARTITION BY (Name, toYYYYMM(Timestamp))
        PRIMARY KEY (Name, Timestamp)
        ORDER BY (Name, Timestamp)
        SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;


create table myDB.TestTable_buffer
(
    Timestamp      DateTime64(6),
    Name           LowCardinality(String),
    Quantity       UInt32,
    Price          Decimal(14, 7),
    City           LowCardinality(String),
    Code           UInt64,
    Source         LowCardinality(String)
)
    engine = Buffer('myDB', 'TestTable', 16, 10, 120, 10000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000);

Insert query example:

INSERT INTO myDB.TestTable_buffer (Timestamp, Name, Quantity, Price, City, Code) FORMAT JSONCompactEachRow  ["2021-06-21 09:42:05.066", "Banana", 15, 28.940000, "Kyiv", 72057594037936208] ;
