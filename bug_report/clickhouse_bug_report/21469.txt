Title: Query fails when it is wrapped with `select * from (...)`
Description:
**Describe the bug**

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
Latest version in Arcadia.
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
```sql
di.man.yp-c.yandex.net :) create table t_str (creation_time String) engine = MergeTree() partition by creation_time order by creation_time

CREATE TABLE t_str
(
    `creation_time` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY creation_time
ORDER BY creation_time
```
* Sample data for all these tables
```sql
insert into t_str values ('2020-02-02')
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
This query works well:
```sql
di.man.yp-c.yandex.net :) select 1 as x from t_str where cast('1970-01-01' as date) <= cast((select max('1970-01-01') from numbers(1)) as date)

SELECT 1 AS x
FROM t_str
WHERE CAST('1970-01-01', 'date') <= CAST(
(
    SELECT max('1970-01-01')
    FROM numbers(1)
), 'date')

Query id: 6ff4732e-88e3-4c95-856d-03f7a0ba494b

┌─x─┐
│ 1 │
└───┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.012 sec. 
```
But when it is wrapped with `select * from (...)` it throws an error:
```sql
di.man.yp-c.yandex.net :) select * from ( select 1 as x from t_str where cast('1970-01-01' as date) <= cast((select max('1970-01-01') from numbers(1)) as date) )

SELECT *
FROM 
(
    SELECT 1 AS x
    FROM t_str
    WHERE CAST('1970-01-01', 'date') <= CAST(
    (
        SELECT max('1970-01-01')
        FROM numbers(1)
    ), 'date')
)

Query id: c9c2e5b1-5bc5-4068-a653-a46f9c568cf0


0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.007 sec. 

Received exception from server (version 21.3.1):
Code: 38. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot parse date: value is too short: Cannot parse Date from String: while executing 'FUNCTION CAST(_subquery2 : 7, 'date' : 2) -> CAST(_subquery2, 'date') Date : 8'. 
```
**Expected behavior**
The second query should return the same value as the first one.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
Received exception from server (version 21.3.1):
Code: 38. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot parse date: value is too short: Cannot parse Date from String: while executing 'FUNCTION CAST(_subquery2 : 7, 'date' : 2) -> CAST(_subquery2, 'date') Date : 8'.
