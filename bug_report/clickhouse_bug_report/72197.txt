Title: Clickhouse 24.10.1 INVALID_JOIN_ON_EXPRESSION: Cannot determine join keys in  ALL INNER JOIN
Description:
**Describe the issue**
I recently upgraded to 24.10.1 from 23.11.3 and some of my queries stopped working.

**How to reproduce**
```
CREATE TABLE address
(
    `email_address` String,
    `domain` LowCardinality(String),
    `first_name` String,
    `last_name` String,
    `country` LowCardinality(String),
    `esp` UInt8,
    `list_import_sid` LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PRIMARY KEY (list_import_sid, country, esp, domain, email_address)
ORDER BY (list_import_sid, country, esp, domain, email_address)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

CREATE TABLE fact_click
(
    `sid` String,
    `campaign_sid` LowCardinality(String),
    `campaign_batch_sid` LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
ORDER BY (campaign_sid, campaign_batch_sid, sid)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

```
WITH
    records AS (SELECT address.email_address FROM address GROUP BY address.email_address),
    stats AS (
        SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact_click INNER JOIN records ON records.email_address = fact_click.email_address) AS num_clicks,
               (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM records) AS num_records
    )
SELECT * FROM stats;
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
Query id: be3c1328-9610-4d95-a02d-c892462349ea


Elapsed: 0.004 sec.

Received exception from server (version 24.10.1):
Code: 403. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot determine join keys in  ALL INNER JOIN ... ON email_address = postman.fact_click.email_address. (INVALID_JOIN_ON_EXPRESSION)
```

**Additional context**
- It works fine in 23.11.3
- The attached query is not static, it can be much bigger since it's constructed programmatically. So, I kinda need it to stay in the same shape...
