Title: Cannot insert a human-readable Enum value using INSERT INTO .. SELECT
Description:
An example table:
```
 :) CREATE TABLE events (
        type Enum8('session' = 1, 'pageview' = 2, 'click' = 3),
        date Date,
        id UInt64
    ) ENGINE = MergeTree(date, (type, date, id), 8192);

Ok. 0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.008 sec.
```

Adding the data from another table on the first try:
```
 :) INSERT INTO events
        SELECT
            'session' AS type,
            today() AS date,
            number AS id
        FROM system.numbers LIMIT 100
    ;

Received exception from server:
Type mismatch for column type. Column has type Enum8('session' = 1, 'pageview' = 2, 'click' = 3), got type String
```

Numbers won't be inserted too:
```
 :) INSERT INTO events
        SELECT
            1 AS type,
            today() AS date,
            number AS id
        FROM system.numbers LIMIT 100
    ;

Received exception from server:
Type mismatch for column type. Column has type Enum8('session' = 1, 'pageview' = 2, 'click' = 3), got type UInt8


 :) INSERT INTO events
        SELECT
            toInt8(1) AS type,
            today() AS date,
            number AS id
        FROM system.numbers LIMIT 100
    ;

Received exception from server:
Type mismatch for column type. Column has type Enum8('session' = 1, 'pageview' = 2, 'click' = 3), got type Int8
```

CASTing works, but it looks pretty bloaty:
```
 :) INSERT INTO events 
        SELECT 
            CAST('session' AS Enum8('session' = 1, 'pageview' = 2, 'click' = 3)) AS type,
            today() AS date,
            number AS id
        FROM system.numbers LIMIT 100
    ;

Ok. 0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec.
```

Would it be OK to make `INSERT INTO (enum, ...) SELECT 'enumvalue', ...` work?
