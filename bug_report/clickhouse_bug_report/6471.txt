Title: Performance degradation 19.13 comparing to 19.9 
Description:
Most cluster machines are on 19.9.2.4, and 2 of them were migrated to 19.13

The query speed significantly differ ( in 4 times ) 
The same query takes 245.019 sec versus 45.357 on 19.9

I can not replicate the problem, as the servers were downgraded back to 19.9
