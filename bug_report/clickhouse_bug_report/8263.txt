Title: wrong result with set enable_optimize_predicate_expression=true 
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use

19.15.4.10

* Which interface to use, if matters
* Non-default settings, if any

set enable_optimize_predicate_expression=true ;

* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved


CREATE TABLE my_sdap.dm_user_behavior_events (`dt` UInt32, `user_id` UInt32, `event_time` DateTime CODEC(DoubleDelta, LZ4), `event_month` UInt32 MATERIALIZED toYYYYMM(event_time), `event_week_begin` UInt32 MATERIALIZED toYYYYMMDD(toMonday(event_time)), `event_dt` UInt32 MATERIALIZED toYYYYMMDD(event_time), `event_hh` UInt8 MATERIALIZED toHour(event_time), `event_mi` UInt8 MATERIALIZED CAST(formatDateTime(event_time, '%M'), 'UInt8'), `event_id` UInt32, `client_platform` UInt8, `client_id` UInt8, `client_ver` Nullable(String) ...  , `mode` UInt8) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/my_sdap/dm_user_behavior_events/{shard}', '{replica}') PARTITION BY event_dt ORDER BY (client_id, event_id, mode, dt, intHash64(user_id)) SAMPLE BY intHash64(user_id) TTL event_time + toIntervalDay(30) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192



CREATE TABLE my_sdap.events on cluster perftest_3shards_2replicas AS my_sdap.dm_user_behavior_events   ENGINE = Distributed( perftest_3shards_2replicas , my_sdap, dm_user_behavior_events, intHash64(user_id)) ;  




* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/dbms/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
