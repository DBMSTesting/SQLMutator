Title: CSV insert error when Float value is 0.00000000 in CSV
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**
The error is caused when the CSV contains a value like `0.00000000`.
ClickHouse shows `ERROR: garbage after UInt64: ".00000000,"`.
I think it's because ClickHouse CSV decoder is looking for a `0`, not a `0.0000000` value.
If I change that field to `0` then the decoder works.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: `ClickHouse server version 19.7.4.26 (official build).`
* Which interface to use, if matters: `clickhouse-client`
* Non-default settings, if any: `No`
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved: 
```
CREATE TABLE x (
  field1 UInt64,
  field2 Float64,
  field3 String
) Engine xxx
```
