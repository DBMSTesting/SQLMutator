Title: Side effect of count() on a NORMAL VIEW of a MergeTree table engine
Description:
Hi, this is possibly a functional bug and here is a test to reproduce it
```sql
CREATE TABLE NUM
(
    id UInt8, 
    n UInt8
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY id
ORDER BY (n, id)

INSERT INTO NUM VALUES (1, 54), (2, 23), (3, 54), (4, 48), (5, 19);

CREATE VIEW VW AS SELECT id, n FROM NUM ORDER BY n;

SELECT *
FROM VW 

┌─id─┬──n─┐
│  5 │ 19 │
│  2 │ 23 │
│  4 │ 48 │
│  1 │ 54 │
│  3 │ 54 │
└────┴────┘
```

So far, so good now try

```sql
select count() from VW WHERE n>50;
┌─count()─┐
│       2 │
└─────────┘

SELECT * FROM VW 

┌─id─┬──n─┐
│  3 │ 54 │
│  1 │ 54 │
└────┴────┘
```
The VIEW has been altered because of the count(), I guess this should not happen.
Is that right ?
