Title: Select uses operator '=' and select uses 'like' for different result
Description:
I created table with schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test(
 `field1` Int64,
 `field2` Int32,
 `field3` String,
 `field4` String,
 `field5` String,
 `field6` Int32,
 `field7` Int64,
 `field8` String,
 `time` Int64,
 `field9` Int64,
 `field10` Int64,
 `field11` Int32,
 `field12` String,
 `field13` Int32,
 `field14` Int32,
 `field15` Int64,
 `field16` Int64,
 `field17` Int64,
 `field18` Int64,
 `field19` String,
 `field20` String,
 `field21` Int64,
 `field22` Int32,
 `field23` String,
 `field24` Int32,
 `field25` Int32,
 `field26` Int64,
 `field27` Int64,
 `field28` Int64,
 `field29` Int64,
 `field30` String,
 `field31` String,
 `date_time` DateTime64
) ENGINE =  ReplicatedMergeTree('/data/clickhouse/replicated/test_repl', 'replica_1')
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date_time)
ORDER BY (time, field1, field2) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```
Note: I use model 2 replicate and 3 shards by field1.

Then, I created the bloomfilter index:
```sql
ALTER TABLE test ON CLUSTER cluster_two_shards ADD INDEX index_field1 (field1) TYPE bloom_filter(0.01) GRANULARITY 4
ALTER TABLE test ON CLUSTER cluster_two_shards ADD INDEX index_field3 (field3) TYPE bloom_filter(0.01) GRANULARITY 4
ALTER TABLE test ON CLUSTER cluster_two_shards ADD INDEX index_field4 (field4) TYPE bloom_filter(0.01) GRANULARITY 4
```

Then, I insert about 300 million rows. And I use two select SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM test WHERE field4 LIKE '210315000330063' AND  time BETWEEN 1615741200000 AND 1615827599000; (1)

SELECT * FROM test WHERE field4 IN ('210315000330063') AND  time BETWEEN 1615741200000 AND 1615827599000; (2)

SELECT * FROM test WHERE field4 = '210315000330063' AND  time BETWEEN 1615741200000 AND 1615827599000; (3)
```

Statement (1) has 4 records, but statements (2) and (3) only have 3 records. **Clickhouse has different behavior between these 2 sentences ?**

@den-crane Can you help me?
