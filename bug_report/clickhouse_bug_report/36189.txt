Title: From 22.3.2.2 while using aggregate function in WITH clause, with rows inserted, Cannot find column % in source stream, there are only columns: []. (THERE_IS_NO_COLUMN)
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

When inserting rows into table and after that using WITH max(column) as columnAlias, getting an error:

Received exception from server (version 22.3.3):
Code: 8. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot find column `columnAlias` in source stream, there are only columns: []. (THERE_IS_NO_COLUMN)

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Same error observed on docker images of these versions:
docker pull clickhouse/clickhouse-server:22.3.3.44
docker pull clickhouse/clickhouse-server:22.3.2.2

**How to reproduce**

* Use 22.3.2.2 or 22.3.3.44 versions running in docker container: 
docker run --name test_ch -it --rm clickhouse/clickhouse-server:22.3.3.44
* Connect to container, use `clickhouse-client`
* Create table: 

```
CREATE TABLE test
                (
                  `dt` DateTime,
                  `text` String
                )
                ENGINE = MergeTree
                ORDER BY dt
```
  
* Insert a single row into the table:

`insert into test values ('2020-01-01', 'text')`

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result:

```
WITH max(dt) AS maxDt
SELECT maxDt
FROM test
```

**Expected behavior**

Should return maximum value for column dt, which in our case is:
┌───────────────maxDt─┐
│ 2020-01-01 00:00:00 │
└─────────────────────┘

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

Received exception from server (version 22.3.3):
Code: 8. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot find column `maxDt` in source stream, there are only columns: []. (THERE_IS_NO_COLUMN)

**Additional context**

Please note that it works fine if we don't use aggregate function like max:

```
WITH dt AS maxDt
SELECT maxDt
FROM test
```
