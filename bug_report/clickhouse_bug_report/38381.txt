Title: Error in Encryption at REST in latest Clickhouse 22.3.7-LTS and 22.6.1.1985 version
Description:
We are using CH in cluster mode in production with replication of data. 
We now want to upgrade the Clickhouse to latest.

**Clickhouse 22.3.7-LTS** 

- I create a FRESH **Containerised** CH **cluster** of 4 pods from above CH release .
- Enabled Encryption at Rest. Changed my default storage policies to **encrypted** on. 
- Created new DB having **replicated and distributed tables**. 
- Ingested data. 
- Running queries like select x,y from Tablename gives me the below exception. 

```
Received exception from server (version 22.3.7):
Code: 432. DB::Exception: Received from clickhouse-clickhouse:9440. DB::Exception: Unknown codec family code: 8: (while reading column xyz_column): While executing MergeTreeInOrder. (UNKNOWN_CODEC)
```
Hence I switched to 
**Clickhouse 22.6.1.1985** 
- I create a FRESH **Containerised** CH **cluster** of 4 pods from above CH release .
- Enabled Encryption at Rest. Changed my default storage policies to **encrypted** on. 
- Created new DB having **replicated and distributed tables**. 
- Ingested data. 
- Running queries like select x,y from Tablename gives me the below exception

```
