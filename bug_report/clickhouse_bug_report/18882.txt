Title: <Error> void DB::AsynchronousMetrics::run(): Code: 173, e.displayText() = DB::ErrnoException: Cannot get vmmap info, errno: 1, strerror: Operation not permitted
Description:
I installed latest available version of CH on freebsd and when starting I get the following error

<Error> void DB::AsynchronousMetrics::run(): Code: 173, e.displayText() = DB::ErrnoException: Cannot get vmmap info, errno: 1, strerror: Operation not permitted

I am getting the same error when installing from ports and from pkg

FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE-p1
ClickHouse server version 20.7.2.30

I feel inside that this has something to do with folder permissions, but my data folder has correct perms

**Expected behavior**
no error displaying?
