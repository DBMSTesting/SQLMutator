Title: Wrong result with certain combination of WHERE
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

See example below

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

YES. ClickHouse server version 22.3.3 revision 54455.

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use

ClickHouse server version 22.3.3 revision 54455.


* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved

```sql
CREATE TABLE product
(
    `name` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY name;
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales
(
    `time` DateTime,
    `product` String,
    `amount` Float32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY time;
```

* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator]

```sql
insert into product values ('1'),('2');

insert into sales values ('2022-01-01 00:00:00', '1', 12);
```

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE time IS NOT NULL AND product in (SELECT name FROM product)
```

> Result: 0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.043 sec.

**Expected behavior**

Should return all records from sales table

**Additional context**

The following combination of where all give **correct** result

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE isNotNull(time)
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE product IN 
(
    SELECT name
    FROM product
)
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE (time > '1970-01-01 00:00:00') AND (product IN 
(
    SELECT name
    FROM product
))
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE isNotNull(time) AND (product IN ('1'))
```
