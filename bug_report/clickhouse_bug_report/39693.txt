Title: Inconsistent behavior of back-slash escaping in json format for meta and data 
Description:
Reproducible on 22.7.1 and 22.6.1
**How to reproduce**

SELECT 1 AS `\\"ph"`
FORMAT JSON

Query id: 0159c301-b91e-4b59-b8e1-840056d18ffb

```
{
	"meta":
	[
		{
			"name": "\\\\\\\"ph\\\"",
			"type": "UInt8"
		}
	],

	"data":
	[
		{
			"\\\"ph\"": 1
		}

	],

	"rows": 1,

	"statistics":
	{
		"elapsed": 0.000840535,
		"rows_read": 1,
		"bytes_read": 1
	}
}
```
Expected result: column name in meta and data should be the same.
Actual result: They are not.

It used to work on 22.3.15 - Even though it has another issue back then.
