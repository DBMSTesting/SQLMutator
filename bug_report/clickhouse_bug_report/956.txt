Title: Unknown identifier error when querying Merge engine wrapping Distributed engine table
Description:
I have a table topology that looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs_replica AS ( date Date, zoneId UInt64, ... ) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree( ... );
CREATE TABLE logs AS logs_replica ENGINE = Distributed('cluster', 'default', 'logs_replica');
CREATE TABLE open.logs AS default.logs ENGINE = Merge('default', 'logs');
```

So the "Merge" engine is effectively just an alias for distributed view in a different database, we do this as different users have access to different databases.

It works fine for some queries:

```
 :) SELECT count() FROM open.logs WHERE date = today() LIMIT 10
...
Ok. 10 rows in set. Elapsed: 1.347 sec. Processed: 111.9 million rows, 1.0GiB (83.1 million rows/s, 792.0MiB/s)
```

But not with GROUP BY:

```
 :) SELECT zoneId, count() FROM open.logs WHERE date = today() GROUP BY zoneId LIMIT 10
                                                                                                                                                                                              
Code: 47, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Received from .... DB::Exception: Unknown identifier (in GROUP BY): zoneId., e.what() = DB::Exception
```

Using just the Distributed view however works.
