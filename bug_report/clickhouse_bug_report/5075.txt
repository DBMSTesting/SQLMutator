Title: Improve exception description `DB::Exception: DDL background thread is not initialized.`
Description:
**Describe the bug**
If some query with `ON CLUSTER` is launched without set zookeeper config executed then the description of the exception is unclear now:
```
Received exception from server (version 19.4.0):
Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: DDL background thread is not initialized.. 
```
It should have something about the lack of necessary `zookeeper` config

**How to reproduce**
* clickhouse-server 19.4.0
* Set sharding only cluster w/o zookeeper, e.g:
```
<graphite>                                           
  <shard>                                            
    <internal_replication>true</internal_replication>
    <replica>                                        
      <host>ch01.local</host>   
      <port>9000</port>                              
      <user>default</user>                           
    </replica>                                       
  </shard>                                           
  <shard>                                            
    <internal_replication>true</internal_replication>
    <replica>                                        
      <host>ch02.local</host>   
      <port>9000</port>                              
      <user>default</user>                           
    </replica>                                       
  </shard>                                           
  <shard>                                            
    <internal_replication>true</internal_replication>
    <replica>
      <host>ch03.local</host>
      <port>9000</port>
      <user>default</user>
    </replica>
  </shard>                                           
</graphite>                                          
```
* `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_sharding.data_l ON CLUSTER graphite ( metric String,  value Float64,  timestamp UInt32,  date Date,  updated UInt32) ENGINE = MergeTree() PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date) ORDER BY (metric, timestamp) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192`

**Expected behavior**
Exception with the clear description about the lack of necessary `zookeeper` config
