Title: Remote Query Execution with sumIf() function faling
Description:
I'm using clickhouse 20.12.3.3 version. 
The execution of sumIf() function is failing on the distributed table
Query:
`SELECT sumIf(pos_sales,isNotNull (pos_sales)) , fin_seg_desc AS SBU　from stores_cost_position_dist　where ((week between 201945 AND 202043)) group by fin_seg_desc;
`

Fails with:
`Code: 42. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Aggregate function sum requires single argument: while receiving packet from node-2:9000: While executing Remote. 
`

Data types:
`pos_sales: Nullable(Float64),
week: Int32,
fin_seg_desc: String
`
The same query is working on the local table.
