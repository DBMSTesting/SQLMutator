Title: Inconsistent results between USING and ON in FULL JOIN
Description:
**Describe the unexpected behaviour**
The result of a `FULL [OUTER] JOIN` query differs when using `USING(col)` and `ON a.col = b.col` when the resulting column is without a table alias.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
ClickHouse server version: 23.4.1.1354

* The query with all columns (correct data)
```sql
SELECT t1.id, t2.id, t2.number
FROM
(
	SELECT number % 4 AS id
	FROM system.numbers
	WHERE id != 2
	LIMIT 4
) AS t1
FULL OUTER JOIN
(
    SELECT number AS id, number
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 3
) AS t2 USING (id)

┌─id─┬─t2.id─┬─number─┐
│  0 │     0 │      0 │
│  1 │     1 │      1 │
│  3 │     0 │      0 │
│  0 │     0 │      0 │
└────┴───────┴────────┘
┌─id─┬─t2.id─┬─number─┐
│  0 │     2 │      2 │
└────┴───────┴────────┘
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected results
```sql
-- with USING
SELECT id, groupArray(number) 
FROM
(
	SELECT number % 4 AS id
	FROM system.numbers
	WHERE id != 2
	LIMIT 4
) AS t1
FULL OUTER JOIN
(
    SELECT number AS id, number
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 3
) AS t2 USING (id)
GROUP BY id

┌─id─┬─groupArray(number)─┐
│  0 │ [0,0]              │
│  3 │ [0]                │
│  2 │ [2]                │
│  1 │ [1]                │
└────┴────────────────────┘

-- with ON
SELECT id, groupArray(number) 
FROM
(
	SELECT number % 4 AS id
	FROM system.numbers
	WHERE id != 2
	LIMIT 4
) AS t1
FULL OUTER JOIN
(
    SELECT number AS id, number
    FROM system.numbers
    LIMIT 3
) AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
GROUP BY id

┌─id─┬─groupArray(number)─┐
│  0 │ [0,0,2]            │
│  1 │ [1]                │
│  3 │ [0]                │
└────┴────────────────────┘
```

**Expected behavior**
`USING` should query the `id` column from the left table.

`ON` should throw an error about the ambiguity of the `id` column.
