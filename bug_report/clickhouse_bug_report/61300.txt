Title: Setting `concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num` doesn't work
Description:


**Describe what's wrong**
It is expected that the `concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num` setting will limit the maximum number of threads used to process a request,  according to the docs [one](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num) [two](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/development/architecture#concurrency-control)

It is observed that no restriction occurs.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**
Yes, checked on version 24.2.1.2248

**Enable crash reporting**

**How to reproduce**

> Which ClickHouse server version to use

 Reproduced in 24.2.1.2248
> Non-default settings, if any

Set `<concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num>2</concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num>` in config.xml
Set ` <max_threads>32</max_threads>` in users.xml
> Queries to run that lead to an unexpected result

Run query `SELECT count(*) FROM numbers_mt(100000000);` and remember its query_id.

Get thread information for this query: 
```sql
select
   length(thread_ids) as total_threads,
   peak_threads_usage
from system.query_log 
where 
   type = 'QueryFinish' 
   and query_id = '{previous_querry_id}';
```

Output:
```
┌─total_threads─┬─peak_threads_usage─┐
│            34 │                 34 │
└───────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

**Expected behavior**

The number of threads is expected to be around 2 (+2) as set in `concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num`, but we see that it is about `max_threads`.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

None

**Additional context**

Found that the integration test for these setting was disabled as broken https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/commit/c7e058fa6e017a7539e702f87dd7b94d8c53c797.
