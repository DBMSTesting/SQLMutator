Title: LOGICAL_ERROR Pipeline for PushingPipelineExecutor was finished before all data was inserted
Description:
I'm able to reproduce smth similar with the following:

``` sh

Stepped on this while trying to reproduce https://s3.amazonaws.com/clickhouse-test-reports/63861/af84e3e1a9c8c3b62f738f231e457efc8ea301ea/ast_fuzzer__tsan_/fatal.log

Not sure if it is connected anyhow with https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/52234 or not. Probably yes, since it requires `max_execution_time = 0.1, timeout_overflow_mode = 'break'`.
