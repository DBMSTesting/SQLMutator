Title: Delete files from Memory database after explicit DROP DATABASE
Description:
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.

**How to reproduce**
If you run this test, the result is not empty. CSV file remains after explicit DROP DATABASE.
``` sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS memory_01268;
CREATE DATABASE memory_01268 ENGINE = Memory;

CREATE TABLE memory_01268.file (n UInt8) ENGINE = File(CSV);

INSERT INTO memory_01268.file VALUES (3), (4);

DROP DATABASE memory_01268;

CREATE DATABASE memory_01268 ENGINE = Memory;

ATTACH TABLE memory_01268.file (n UInt8) ENGINE = File(CSV);

SELECT * FROM memory_01268.file;

DROP DATABASE memory_01268;
```

Actually second run of this query results in error as files remain and DB can not be created.
```
Code: 57. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Directory for table data data/memory_01268/file/ already exists.
```

**Expected behavior**
Delete files associated with Database when we DROP DATABASE explicitly.
