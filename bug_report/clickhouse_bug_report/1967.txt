Title: "interval" keyword behaviour differs for local and remote tables
Description:
Hello.
I faced with a strange behaviour when querying a distributed table.

This query
```
SELECT count() / interval as rps, max(time) - toDateTime(toStartOfMonth(min(time)))  as interval  FROM distributed.logs  WHERE userID = 'SOME_ID' AND  eventDate >= (today() - 30)
```
fails with this exception:
```
Progress: 3.56 million rows, 172.90 MB (33.22 million rows/s., 1.61 GB/s.)  1%Received exception from server (version 1.1.54343):
Code: 62. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: Received from some_ip:9000. DB::Exception: Syntax error: failed at position 106: default.decisions  WHERE (userID = 'SOME_ID') AND (eventDate >= (today() - 30)). Expected one of: alias, AS, token, AND, OR, BETWEEN, SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR, IS, LIKE, NOT LIKE, IN, NOT IN, GLOBAL IN, GLOBAL NOT IN, Comma, Dot, Arrow, QuestionMark.
```
---

**But** this query doesn't fail:
```
SELECT max(time) - toDateTime(toStartOfMonth(min(time)))  as interval, count() / interval as rps  FROM distributed.decisions  WHERE userID = 'SOME_ID' AND  eventDate >= (today() - 30)
```

What's the difference: I changed the order of the elements in the select statement: from `rps`, `interval` to `interval`, `rps`.
And the weirdest part of this issue is that both of these queries works like a charm for the local non-distributed table on all servers of our cluster separately.


Do you know whether it's a bug or predictable behaviour but I just don't know something?
