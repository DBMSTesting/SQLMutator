Title: "Cannot find column xxx in source stream" with cluster and ReplacingMergeTree
Description:
I get an error "Cannot find column updated in source stream" in a cluster of 2 nodes with a `ReplacingMergeTree(updated)` if I don't select the `updated` column or one of the columns of the primary key.

(tested with 19.6.2.11)

How to reproduce:
- create a 2 node cluster
- on each node: 
```
CREATE TABLE default.test (`Id` String, `Timestamp` DateTime, `updated` DateTime) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(updated) PARTITION BY tuple() ORDER BY (Timestamp, Id)

INSERT INTO default.test VALUES('1',now(),now());

```
- try to execute this query on each node:
```
SELECT Id,Timestamp FROM cluster('cluster','default','test') FINAL ORDER BY Timestamp
```
This works on one of the node and fails on the other with this error:
```
Code: 8. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Cannot find column updated in source stream.
```

Same error with this request:
```
select Timestamp,updated from cluster('cluster','default','test') final order by Timestamp

Code: 8. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Cannot find column Id in source stream.
```

Workaround: select `updated` and all columns of the primary key.
