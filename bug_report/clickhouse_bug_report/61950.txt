Title: Alias replacement is working inconsitantly
Description:
I got surprising result with the usage of with when replacing aliases. (version v23.8.9)

for exemple I was expecting this query to return 1 
```
with dummy + 1 as dummy select dummy from system.one
```
But clickhouse seems to ignore the `dummy` in the with and return 0

```
WITH dummy + 1 AS dummy
SELECT dummy
FROM system.one


┌─dummy─┐
│     0 │
└───────┘

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec. 
```

Strangly when running this query ```SELECT dummy + 1 as dummy FROM system.one``` I correctly got 1
But both query should (imo) have the same semantic


Another wierd case is this query :
```with dummy + 1 as dummy select dummy + 1 as dummy , dummy from system.one```
I'm not sure such case must be resolved but the return is quite strange, look at the result of clikchouse parsing.

```
WITH dummy + 1 AS dummy
SELECT
    dummy,
    dummy
FROM system.one


┌─dummy─┬─dummy─┐
│     1 │     1 │
└───────┴───────┘
```


If we rerun the result of the parsing we got the result with 0.

I'm not sure wich solution should be the prefered one, but for sure it should be consitant.


```

┌─getSetting('prefer_column_name_to_alias')─┐
│ false                                     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─getSetting('enable_global_with_statement')─┐
│ false                                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─getSetting('optimize_respect_aliases')─┐
│ false                                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
