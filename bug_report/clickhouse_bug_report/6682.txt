Title: docker release tagging (ability to fetch image w/o build number)
Description:
Sometimes you need to use particular patch version. Like compare bahavior of 19.11.6 vs 19.11.7.

Currently you need to know build number to fetch particular patch version:
```
docker run --rm  yandex/clickhouse-server:19.11.8
Unable to find image 'yandex/clickhouse-server:19.11.8' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: manifest for yandex/clickhouse-server:19.11.8 not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown.

docker run --rm  yandex/clickhouse-server:19.11.8.46
# works ok
```
