Title: Issue when working with Parquet format
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Related to issue #15022

When I worked with table, which engine was File(Parquet), I discovered the bug, that you can insert only one file in such table, and after trying to select data - you will recevie a data reading error

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use - 20.6.6.7
* Which interface to use, if matters - native, from clickhouse-client
* Non-default settings, if any - None
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved

DDL for table creation:

```
CREATE TABLE docker.parquet_files (
      ghRequestUser String,
      recordCreatedTime Int64,
      name String,
      isStarred UInt8,
      starredAt Int64,
      ownerLogin String,
      ownerType String,
      fork UInt8,
      createdAt Int64,
      updatedAt Int64,
      pushedAt Int64,
      size Int64,
      stargazersCount Int64,
      watchersCount Int64,
      language String,
      hasIssues UInt8,
      hasProjects UInt8,
      hasDownloads UInt8,
      hasWiki UInt8,
      hasPages UInt8,
      forksCount Int64,
      archived UInt8,
      disabled UInt8,
      openIssues Int64
    ) ENGINE = File(Parquet);
```


* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary

Examples can be retrieved from Google Drive: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16iuphNwAWn4jLb_autMhHIYuuqW4c5EV?usp=sharing)

Environment, where I found this error, may be retrieved from the GitHub repository: [Link](https://github.com/roomanidzee/code-stats/tree/master/docker)

All parquet files have corresponding schema:

```
message GitHubInfoRecord {
  required binary ghRequestUser (STRING) = 1;
  required int64 recordCreatedTime = 2;
  required binary name (STRING) = 3;
  required boolean isStarred = 4;
  required int64 starredAt = 5;
  required binary ownerLogin (STRING) = 6;
  required binary ownerType (STRING) = 7;
  required boolean fork = 8;
  required int64 createdAt = 9;
  required int64 updatedAt = 10;
  required int64 pushedAt = 11;
  required int64 size = 12;
  required int64 stargazersCount = 13;
  required int64 watchersCount = 14;
  required binary language (STRING) = 15;
  required boolean hasIssues = 16;
  required boolean hasProjects = 17;
  required boolean hasDownloads = 18;
  required boolean hasWiki = 19;
  required boolean hasPages = 20;
  required int64 forksCount = 21;
  required boolean archived = 22;
  required boolean disabled = 23;
  required int64 openIssues = 24;
}
```

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
Trying to add file to the table:
```
cat /opt/parquet_files/final.parquet | clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO docker.parquet_files FORMAT Parquet"
```
If I insert only one file at that table - all okay, "SELECT" queries are working.

If I try to insert another file to that table, after "SELECT" attempt I recevie such exception:

```

1105883ac715 :) SELECT * FROM docker.parquet_files;

SELECT *
FROM docker.parquet_files


Received exception from server (version 20.6.6):
Code: 33. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Error while reading Parquet data: IOError: Unexpected end of stream: Page was smaller (67) than expected (385): While executing File. 

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.137 sec. 
```

**Expected behavior**
Selection of the data can be done after inserting multiple files to the table with Engine = File (Parquet). (and with other file formats, possible, too)

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```

1105883ac715 :) SELECT * FROM docker.parquet_files;

SELECT *
FROM docker.parquet_files
