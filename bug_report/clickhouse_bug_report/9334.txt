Title: Kafka consumer does not receive correct offset
Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
My configuration: 
- Kafka cluster, topic with 4 partitions  
- 4 ClickHouse servers with KafkaEngine on each server

Sometimes Kafka consumer just stop receiving the right offset from Kafka (message occasionally becomes the same forever):
```
2020.02.24 04:41:59.931351 [ 36 ] {} <Trace> StorageKafka (topic_name_queue): Polled offset 11677502 (topic: topic_name, partition: 0)
2020.02.24 04:41:59.931392 [ 36 ] {} <Trace> StorageKafka (topic_name_queue): Nothing to commit.
2020.02.24 04:41:59.932957 [ 36 ] {} <Trace> StorageKafka (topic_name_queue): Committed offset 11677502 (topic: topic_name, partition: 0)
2020.02.24 04:41:59.933098 [ 36 ] {} <Trace> StorageKafka (topic_name_queue): Execution took 512 ms.
```
In Kafka itself I can see that offset for partition_0 increases, everything is ok, but in ClickHouse logs offset remains the same as it was a couple of hours ago.
Moreover, other servers and partitions operate perfectly.

Kafka logs are clean, ClickHouse server restart or consumer reattach helps. 

ClickHouse version: 19.16.13.54
