Title: If statement not working correctly with decrypt function
Description:
Hi, I'm trying to filter by a encrypted column depending on a condition, but if statement is not working correctly and seems that the column is decrypted with both algorithms before checking the if statement. The table is partitioned by datetime, and it's only failing when datetime filters are also applied to the query. 

Here's an example:

`SELECT count()
FROM data_table
WHERE (if(has(array, 'a'), decrypt('aes-256-gcm', encrypted_column, 'key', 'iv'), decrypt('aes-256-cfb128', encrypted_column, 'key')) = 'value1') AND (datetime >= toDateTime('2022-06-14 05:35:36')) AND (datetime < toDateTime('2022-06-14 05:45:36'))`

The error is the following: 

`DB::Exception: Encrypted data is smaller than the size of additional data for AEAD mode, cannot decrypt.`
