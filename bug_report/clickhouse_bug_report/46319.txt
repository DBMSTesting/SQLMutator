Title: Wrong array-to-row expanded result when running ARRAY JOIN
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

**Describe what's wrong**

> We have query that converts multiple array columns into rows using ARRAY JOIN clause. When running count(*) after conversion, the result appears to be different from expected result based on column order on the ARRAY JOIN clause.

> A link to reproducer in [https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/2ef05553-1bf3-4288-9531-353cf71b700f](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/2ef05553-1bf3-4288-9531-353cf71b700f).

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

[The list of releases](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/utils/list-versions/version_date.tsv)
22.12.1.1752 (official build)
23.1.3.5 (official build)

**Enable crash reporting**

> If possible, change "enabled" to true in "send_crash_reports" section in `config.xml`:

```
<send_crash_reports>
        <!-- Changing <enabled> to true allows sending crash reports to -->
        <!-- the ClickHouse core developers team via Sentry https://sentry.io -->
        <enabled>false</enabled>
```

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
* - 22.12, 23.1
* Which interface to use, if matters
* - clickhouse-client / dbeaver
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
