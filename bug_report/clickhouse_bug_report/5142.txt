Title: MV with JOIN over local . Insert into distributed. DB::Exception: There is no query: while pushing to view
Description:
Just for history and search.
```
create table t  (A Int64) Engine = MergeTree() order by tuple();
create table t_d  as  t ENGINE = Distributed (test_shard_localhost,currentDatabase(),t);
create materialized view t_v Engine=MergeTree() order by tuple() 
as select A from t left join (select toInt64(dummy) as A from system.one) using A;

insert into t_d select number from numbers(2);
DB::Exception: There is no query: while pushing to view arc.t_v.
```

Though insert into local tables works
```
insert into t select number from numbers(2);
OK.
```

Insert into distributed also works if MV does not have join
```
drop table if exists arc.t_v ;
create materialized view t_v Engine=MergeTree() order by tuple() as select * from t;
insert into t_d select number from numbers(2);
OK.
```
