Title: Optimize Table FINAL bug
Description:
When i wan't optimaze my table in syntax:

`OPTIMIZE TABLE nameTable PARTITION toYYYYMMDD(today()-1) FINAL;`
I have this error.
`Code: 62, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Syntax error: failed at position 68: FINAL. Expected one of: AND, OR, token, NOT, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS, NOT LIKE, IN, NOT IN, GLOBAL IN, GLOBAL NOT IN, QuestionMark (version 20.3.11.97)`

Don't understand what i must do. Also yesterday it works but after updating DB its wrong. I did not find anything new in the documentation. Maybe i doing something wrong?
