Title: distinct on (id) with id in subquery with allow_experimental_analyzer=1 wrong result
Description:
> Clickhouse 24.5.1

https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/6c796980-5cd8-4ced-9063-99fbafb74cbd
```sql
create table test ENGINE ReplacingMergeTree() PRIMARY KEY (id)
as select number as id from numbers(1000000);
insert into test select number from numbers(1000000) order by number desc;

SELECT distinct on (id) id
FROM test final
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT id
    FROM test final
    ORDER BY id ASC
    LIMIT 4
)
ORDER BY id ASC
settings allow_experimental_analyzer = 1;
````

expected to return
```
0
1
2
3
```
but return random numbers, like:
```
516097
516098
516099
516100
```

this work: (allow_experimental_analyzer=0)
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/9121e082-f487-4cdd-abf7-424b90f7a6b4
```
SELECT distinct on (id) id
FROM test final
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT id
    FROM test final
    ORDER BY id ASC
    LIMIT 4
)
ORDER BY id ASC
settings allow_experimental_analyzer = 0;
```

and this also work: (distinct on (id) -> distinct)
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/7029c1c9-09ec-4de9-a8d3-6ef4787a34a9
```
SELECT distinct id
FROM test final
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT id
    FROM test final
    ORDER BY id ASC
    LIMIT 4
)
ORDER BY id ASC
settings allow_experimental_analyzer = 1;
```


**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

yes
