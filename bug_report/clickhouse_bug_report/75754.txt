```

### Does it reproduce on the most recent release?

Yes

### How to reproduce

select sum(dummy = 0) from remote('127.0.0.{1,2}', system.one) group by dummy having dummy = 0

### Expected behavior

_No response_

### Error message and/or stacktrace

_No response_

### Additional context

`having dummy = 0` will be pushed over aggregation, and will not remove filter column from header, because of `sum(dummy = 0)` can take advantage of it. and after the first phase of aggragator, it has, `dummy = 0`, `dummy`, `sum(dummy = 0)`, 3 columns,

If it has remote source, the second phase of aggragator only requires two columns, `sum(dummy = 0)` and group by column dummy, instead of 3 columns, so the error happens.
