Title: Incorrect error on query
Description:
I think the following query returns the error incorrectly:

```
SELECT concat('http://reddit.com/r/', subreddit, '/comments/', replaceRegexpOne(link_id, 't[0-9]_', ''))
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
        y, 
        subreddit, 
        link_id, 
        cnt
    FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            created_date AS y, 
            link_id, 
            subreddit, 
            count(*) AS cnt
        FROM commententry1 
        WHERE toYear(created_date) = 2016
        GROUP BY 
            y, 
            link_id, 
            subreddit
        ORDER BY y ASC
    ) 
    ORDER BY 
        y ASC, 
        cnt DESC
    LIMIT 1 BY y
) 
```

On this query I am getting:
```
Received exception from server:
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Not found column y in block. There are only columns: subreddit, link_id. 
```

But I do not really need `y` in the final result set, and I can't see what's wrong if I do not specify it
