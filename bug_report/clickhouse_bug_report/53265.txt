Title: Backup with EXCEPT clause doesn't work as per documentation
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

As per the [documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/backup#command-summary) it seems like clickhouse support specifying EXCEPT clause for every DATABASE like:

```
BACKUP DATABASE foo EXCEPT TABLES a, DATABASE bar EXCEPT TABLES b TO S3('https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/foobar/foobar')
```
but the above command throws [syntax error](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/e76b904a-394d-4df2-aa41-81f5d606508c).

Clickhouse only supports specifying EXCEPT clause with the last database in the list

```
BACKUP DATABASE foo, DATABASE bar EXCEPT TABLES b TO S3('https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/foobar/foobar')
```
the above command works successfully.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes


**Expected behavior**

I was expecting it should be possible to specify the EXCEPT clause with each DATABASE specified.
