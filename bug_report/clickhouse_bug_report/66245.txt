Description:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (
  uid Int16, 
  t DateTime, 
  ta DateTime alias toStartOfHour(t)
) ENGINE=MergeTree order by uid;

select toStartOfDay(x.ta) ta from t as x group by toStartOfDay(x.ta) order by toStartOfDay(x.ta);
OK

select toStartOfDay(x.ta) ta from remote('127.0.0.{1,2}', default, t) x group by toStartOfDay(x.ta) order by toStartOfDay(x.ta) 

DB::Exception: Multiple expressions toStartOfHour(__table1.t) AS ta and toStartOfDay(toStartOfHour(__table1.t) AS ta) AS ta for alias ta. In scope SELECT toStartOfDay(toStartOfHour(__table1.t) AS ta) AS ta FROM default.t AS __table1 GROUP BY toStartOfDay(ta) ORDER BY toStartOfDay(ta) ASC. (MULTIPLE_EXPRESSIONS_FOR_ALIAS)
