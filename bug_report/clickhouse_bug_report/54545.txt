Title: A part with failed quorum may be detached while `GET_PART` entries still exist on some replicas
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

It's a (minor?) bug in quorum inserts: a part with failed quorum may be detached while GET_PART entries still exist on some replicas. Maybe these replicas could skip GET_PART entries using the "Marked quorum for part {} as failed." logic, but:
- There's no synchronization between executeFetch and PartCheckThread, so PartCheckThread can decide that part is lost before executeFetch had a chance to apply that logic
- As I see from executeFetch code, the logic can be applied only once (only on one replica), because we don't have queue.removeFailedQuorumPart(part_info); return true; for the State was changed or isn't expected when trying to mark quorum for part {} as failed branch
