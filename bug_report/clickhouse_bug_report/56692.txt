Title: CapnProto autogenerated schemas fail when column names are not CamelCase
Description:
> Please make sure that the version you're using is still supported (you can find the list [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/SECURITY.md#scope-and-supported-versions)).

> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

` SELECT * from table format CapnProto SETTINGS format_capn_proto_use_autogenerated_schema=1, output_format_schema='schema.capnp'`

fails with:

```
Ok.
Exception on client:
Code: 1002. DB::Exception: Code: 1002. DB::Exception: Unknown exception while parsing CapnProto schema: Cap'n Proto declaration names should use camelCase and must not contain underscores. (Code generators may convert names to the appropriate style for the target language.), schema dir and file: /, schema.capnp. () (version 23.10.1.1976 (official build)). ()
```

Would it be an idea to have a clickhouse conversion/setting CamelCase -> camel_case?
