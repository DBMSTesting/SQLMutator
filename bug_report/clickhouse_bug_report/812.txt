Title: Got `Checksum doesn't match` error while query data.
Description:
Hi, guys, I am using docker for clickhouse, I got this error when I was trying to query data from table

```
Code: 40, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Checksum doesn't match: corrupted data.: while reading column scheduleId at /opt/clickhouse//data/click, e.what() = DB::Exception
```

This is my query statement, 
```
select * from click where clickId = 'abcdefg'
```

I tried to read docs, **is there any solution to fix the data without replica**? I don't have any replica for now. 
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
