Title: Table as column?
Description:
```
SELECT *
FROM y2018.dist AS t
INNER JOIN tmp.A ON t.a = A.a
INNER JOIN tmp.B ON t.b = B.b
WHERE t.a IN
(
    SELECT a
    FROM tmp.A
)
```
fails with:
Received exception from server (version 19.17.5):
Code: 352. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot refer column 'tmp.A' to table.

If table A is in default database (so it doesn't need qualifier) works fine.

A bug?

Version 19.17.5.18

Query doesn't make sense.... simplest example.
