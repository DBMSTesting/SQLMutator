Title: SQL syntax checker mistake dictGet parameters as column names 
Description:
in SQL syntax checker, if the column name shares the same name as a dictionary, it will be considered appearing more than once if a dictionary method is called, e.g.,

SELECT dictGet('qmesh', 'QualifierName', qid) AS qmesh FROM TABLE

will result in execption:

DB::Exception: Column qmesh specified more than once. 

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
clickhouse-server 20.11.4

* Which interface to use, if matters

clickhouse-client

* Non-default settings, if any

create a dictionary based on clickhouse, called 'qmesh'

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

SELECT dictGet('qmesh', 'QualifierName', qid) AS qmesh FROM TABLE

**Expected behavior**

Clickhouse should differentiate the text within a method from text in the SQL column names

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

DB::Exception: Column qmesh specified more than once. 

**Additional context**
None
