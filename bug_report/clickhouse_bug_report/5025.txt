Title: SegmentFault of attaching partition if altering table at the same time
Description:

**Describe the bug**
Hi. Recently we found a segment fault when attaching partitions. The log shows that there are altering operations and attaching operations at the same time. I have checked the code, and found attach function has no lock to prevent altering table schema. The stack is as follows.

I think I can add a lockStructureForAlter in the attachPartition function. If you think it makes sense, I will fix this problem later.

**How to reproduce**
Sorry for that I have not reproduced this bug. May be the concurrency of my test is too low to reproduced it.

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
18.14.10

* Which interface to use, if matters
there are two kinds of operations we found in log:
alter table xxxx add column xxxxxx
alter table xxxx attach partition xxxxxx
