Title: Unexpected result when using column as predicate
Description:
**Describe the unexpected behaviour**
Test case tests/queries/0_stateless/01674_filter_by_uint8.sql, the query is:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t_filter;
CREATE TABLE t_filter(s String, a Array(FixedString(3)), u UInt64, f UInt8)
ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY u;

INSERT INTO t_filter SELECT toString(number), ['foo', 'bar'], number, toUInt8(number) FROM numbers(1000);
SELECT * FROM t_filter WHERE f LIMIT 5;
```

Expected result from reference file is:

```
1	['foo','bar']	1	1
2	['foo','bar']	2	1
3	['foo','bar']	3	1
4	['foo','bar']	4	1
5	['foo','bar']	5	1
```

It doesn't look right to me, shouldn't it be:

```
1	['foo','bar']	1	1
2	['foo','bar']	2	2
3	['foo','bar']	3	3
4	['foo','bar']	4	4
5	['foo','bar']	5	5
```

If it's not intended, then probably a bug when executing predicate action with column name is same as output name.
