Title: has function doesn't work corectly with Nullable strings
Description:
`has` functions seems is not working correctly when we have an array of nullable strings:

I saw that using `Array(Nullable(Uint8))` is working correctly . I didn't tested with more data types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_has_function(arr Array(Nullable(String))) ENGINE = Memory;
INSERT INTO test_has_function(arr) values ([null, 'str1', 'str2']),(['str1', 'str2']), ([]), ([]);
```

```sql
SELECT arr, has(`arr`, 'str1') FROM test_has_function;

[null,'str1','str2']  0 (WRONG - should be 1)
['str1','str2']       1 (OK)
[]                    0 (OK)
[]                    0 (OK)
```
