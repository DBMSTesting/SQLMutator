Title: Insert failure with Ok repsponse and  empty logs
Description:


**Describe the bug**
We had a server failure. Server was replaced but drives were kept. After that I can't insert into distributed table  No logs clickhouse-server.err.log.

```
 CREATE TABLE tablename (
  `clientapp__project` LowCardinality(String),
  `user` UUID,
  `user__id` String,
  `user__createdon` DateTime,
  `updatedon` DateTime,
  `typeid` UInt8,
  `score` UInt64,
  `geo__regioncode` String,
  `geo__countrycode` String,
  `languageid` UInt8
) ENGINE = Distributed(
  rep,
  database_name,
  shard_name,
  cityHash64(toString(user__trackingid))
)
```
 If I execute

```
insert into  tablename (clientapp__project )
values ('cas3')
```
I've got: 

`select * from tablename  where clientapp__project='cas3' `

No records

If  I rebuild that distribute table (drop create) everything is running ok for 5 or 10 minutes. After that data is not inserted. There is no any errors or logs. Just nothing. Server responses - Ok.


shard_name is table separated on 3 shards. The problem exists only on replaced server. 

Also I've tried to format drive and move data here again (resync from replica). The problem stays.

Next time I've tried to wait some time. After 10 minutes it started working (once)

When I run optimize table final.  I have information message like 

'part * on a replica suddenly appeared, will recheck checksums'. Remote replica is used as readonly. There is no any writes there.

Clickhouse versions: 

20.3
last tests were on 20.4.4.18
