Title: Projection with max value
Description:
Clickhouse 22.8.13.20 (also tested with 22.8.17 and 23.3.2.37)

Table
```
CREATE TABLE test.proj
(
`date` Date,
`ID` String,
`A` Array(UInt16)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(date)
ORDER BY (length(A), cityHash64(ID), ID)
SAMPLE BY cityHash64(ID)
TTL date + toIntervalDay(30)
```
today() - in a time of reporting is 2023-05-09

have often such query
`SELECT max(date) FROM test.proj PREWHERE date != today()`
It is doing scan and is much heavier than it could be. Wanted to workaround this with projection. So executed 
```
ALTER TABLE test.proj
ADD PROJECTION maxdate
(
  SELECT max(date)
  GROUP BY date
)
```
then materialize and after that my query returns
```
SELECT max(date)
FROM test.proj
PREWHERE date != today()

Query id: 20b3ed0a-626a-493a-8732-d7f1440ff9b1

┌──max(date)─┐
│ 1970-01-01 │
└────────────┘
```
Before was
```
SELECT max(date)
FROM test.proj
PREWHERE date != today()

Query id: e55d55c1-e1af-4063-b751-9ac3956af5fc

┌──max(date)─┐
│ 2023-05-10 │
└────────────┘
```
Another test so i cleared yesterday partition
` ALTER TABLE test.proj CLEAR PROJECTION maxdate IN PARTITION '20230508' `
and it returns `'2023-05-08'` still weird
Changing partition key to month seems to fixing everything but it is really sneaky that is using projection in query and result is really unexpected.
