Title: ALTER USER RENAME TO requires CREATE USER grant from 25.1
Description:

### Question

```sql
CREATE USER user1;
GRANT ALTER USER ON *.* TO user1;
CREATE USER user2;
```

Login with user1:
```sql
ALTER USER user2 RENAME TO user3;
```
Output:
`
Received exception from server (version 25.1.1):
Code: 497. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: user1: Not enough privileges. To execute this query, it's necessary to have the grant CREATE USER ON user3. (ACCESS_DENIED)
`

Before 25.1 `ALTER USER` privilege was enough to execute `ALTER USER RENAME TO` query.
Is that expected? Which PR changed behavior?
