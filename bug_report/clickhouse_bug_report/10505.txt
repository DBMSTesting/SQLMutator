Title: I can not run clickhouse client on Google Colab
Description:
**Describe the bug**

I'm trying to use clickhouse to do some analisys en [New York Taxi Trips data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). I'm using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to do the analisys. I'm installing Clickhouse using this commands:

```
!apt-get install dirmngr
!apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv E0C56BD4
!echo "deb http://repo.clickhouse.tech/deb/stable/ main/" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
!apt-get update
!apt-get install -y clickhouse-server clickhouse-client
!service clickhouse-server start
```

The problem is when i'm executing clickhouse-client, because i'm getting this error:

    src/tcmalloc.cc:283] Attempt to free invalid pointer 0x7f3ef801f000 

with any query executed, including also something as simple as:

```
!clickhouse-client --query "select 1"
```

I want to use clickhouse to do the data wrangling as part of my learning process of data science, and Google Colab is a very popular tool in that circle.

**How to reproduce**
* Version of installed package clickhouse-server  is 20.3.8.53
* i'm trying to use clickhouse-client to connect to clickhouse-server, both inside the same google colab notebook.
* I'm not using custom settings.
* I cannot create table, and execute some simple command, neither,
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

    SELECT 1;

**Expected behavior**
I expected clickhouse-client can connect to clickhouse-server, with both, server and client, running inside a Google Colab Notebook. With clickhouse-client i want to execute sql commands, load data, etc; conected to the clickhouse-server.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

    src/tcmalloc.cc:283] Attempt to free invalid pointer 0x7f3ef801f000
