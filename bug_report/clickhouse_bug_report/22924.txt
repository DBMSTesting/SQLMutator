Title: "Not found column in block" in distributed query with subquery
Description:
**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
latest master/arcadia
* Non-default settings, if any
```sql
SET prefer_localhost_replica=0
```
(With a local stream the query works fine)
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
```sql
create table "t0" (a Int64, b Int64) engine = MergeTree() partition by a order by a;
create table "dist_t0" (a Int64, b Int64) engine = Distributed(test_shard_localhost, default, t0);
```
* Sample data for all these tables
```sql
insert into t0 values (0, 0);
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```sql
di.man.yp-c.yandex.net :) SELECT a / (SELECT sum(number) FROM numbers(10)) FROM dist_t0

SELECT a / 
    (
        SELECT sum(number)
        FROM numbers(10)
    )
FROM dist_t0
