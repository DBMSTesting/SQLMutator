Title: Different results while aliasing expression to column name on distributed table engine.
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Local and remote shards returns different results, when you use alias for expression with same name as column name.

**How to reproduce**
ClickHouse server version 20.1.3, 

```
CREATE TABLE d_one
(
    dummy UInt8
)
ENGINE = Distributed(cluster, system, one, rand())
```
```
select _shard_num, toUInt8(1) as dummy from d_one as o WHERE o.dummy = 0;

SELECT
    _shard_num,
    toUInt8(1) AS dummy
FROM d_one AS o
WHERE o.dummy = 0

┌─_shard_num─┬─dummy─┐
│          4 │     1 │
└────────────┴───────┘
1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec.
```
localhost shard see difference between dummy and o.dummy
```
select _shard_num, toUInt8(1) as dummy from d_one as o WHERE o.dummy = 1;

SELECT
    _shard_num,
    toUInt8(1) AS dummy
FROM d_one AS o
WHERE o.dummy = 1

┌─_shard_num─┬─dummy─┐
│          3 │     1 │
└────────────┴───────┘
┌─_shard_num─┬─dummy─┐
│          1 │     1 │
└────────────┴───────┘
┌─_shard_num─┬─dummy─┐
│          2 │     1 │
└────────────┴───────┘

3 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec.
```
all remote shards think that dummy = o.dummy


**Expected behavior**
All shards return same result.

**Additional context**
I am a little confused, shoud it work in that way, which i expect from it or not.
