Title: Unexpected behaviour of LIMIT WITH TIES and LIMIT BY mix CH19.15.3.6
Description:
Parser silently removes `WITH TIES` from `LIMIT` clause if `LIMIT BY` was used.

**How to reproduce**
Original query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT number % 5 AS a, count() AS b, c
    FROM numbers(10) 
    ARRAY JOIN [1,2] AS c
    GROUP BY a,c
) AS table
ORDER BY a 
LIMIT 3 WITH TIES BY a
```
Parsed query (clickhouse-client):
```sql
SELECT *
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
        number % 5 AS a, 
        count() AS b, 
        c
    FROM numbers(10)
    ARRAY JOIN [1, 2] AS c
    GROUP BY 
        a, 
        c
) AS table
ORDER BY a ASC
LIMIT 3 BY a
```

**Expected behavior**
Syntax error or working `LIMIT BY` with support for `WITH TIES`
