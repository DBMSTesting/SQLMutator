Title: execute sql lose data,sql=INSERT INTO final_all SELECT FROM tmp_all 
Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
We use flink to write kafka data to clickhouse, first to the temporary table (this step does not lose data problems).then The temporary table written to the final table (tmp, final table are all ReplicatedMergeMergeTree and Distributed engine), but this step often loses data, and the java code in flink finds no errors and exceptions. Clickhouse's log also found no problem. The sql statement is as follows: INSERT INTO final_all(checkpoint_id,checkpoint_timestamp) SELECT checkpoint_id,checkpoint_timestamp FROM tmp_all WHERE checkpoint_id = %s AND checkpoint_timestamp = %s. Can you see it? Thank

**How to reproduce**
* tmp,final table are all ReplicatedMergeTree and Distributed engine
* write to tmp table.  sql= INSERT INTO tmp_all VALUES %s ,this step does not lose data problems
* write tmp table to final. sql=INSERT INTO final_all SELECT FROM tmp_all , usually lose data
* tmp_all and final_all are Distributed table
* Write the final table immediately after writing the TMP table
