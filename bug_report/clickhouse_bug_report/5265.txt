Title: Incorrect single quote escaping in CSV output
Description:
When using the HTTP interface the CSV output escapes single quotes with a backslash. From my understanding this is not compliant with [RFC4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180). In CSV only double quotes must be escaped when the full value is quoted in double quotes if it contains the separator  (and not with a backslash, but with a double double quote).

**How to reproduce**

I can reproduce this with ClickHouse 19.1.1 and with 18.14.9 using the HTTP interface:
```
$ echo "SELECT 'd\'Artagnan'"  | curl http://localhost:8123 --data-binary @-
d\'Artagnan
```
The single quote in `d\'Artagnan` is escaped. This is incorrect.


When running the same query in `clickhouse-client` the single quote in the result is **not** escaped (this is correct):
```
ilya.local :) select 'd\'Artagnan'

SELECT 'd\'Artagnan'

┌─'d\'Artagnan'─┐
│ d'Artagnan    │
└───────────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec. 
```



**Expected behavior**

Single quotes in CSV produced by the HTTP interface shouldn't be escaped:

```
$ echo "SELECT 'd\'Artagnan'"  | curl http://localhost:8123 --data-binary @-
d'Artagnan
```
