Title: Adding a where clause in the following query never finishes and blows up memory 
Description:
The following query tested on r6.8xlarge never finishes and eventually uses all 256 gb of memory until the instance terminates.  because of the where clause conditional added `WHERE (v_date >= '2022-05-08') AND (v_date <= '2022-06-07')` 
EXPLAIN query also has the same effect of not finishing.   tested on 22.3, 22.4, 22.5  but i suspect it also does not work on 21.8

Removing the  `WHERE (v_date >= '2022-05-08') AND (v_date <= '2022-06-07')`  condition returns in sub second 
32 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.285 sec. Processed 2.16 million rows, 17.29 MB (7.60 million rows/s., 60.76 MB/s.)
