Title: Segfault when creating view with recursive
Description:
Hi,

I was playing around with new recursive feature and ran into a bug that crashes ClickHouse.

I was using ClickHouse version 23.8.4.13 and tried to create View like this
```sql
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS test_query AS (
  WITH RECURSIVE
    42 as ttt
  select ttt
);
```
but got segmentation fault error.

The query itself works fine tho.

It reproduces on fiddle.clickhouse
