Title: When out of disk space Kafka engine will drop messages
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Under certain circumstances the Kafka engine will commit message offsets without persisting the corresponding messages. In our case this happened when the Clickhouse cluster ran out of disk space: messages are still being pulled from Kafka, failed to store to disk but then offsets are committed anyway. This may cause message loss.

**How to reproduce**
* Clickhouse version: v19.1.14
* Set up a table with Kafka engine (`ENGINE = Kafka()`), listening to a Kafka topic
* Feed data into the Kafka topic
* Ensure there is no more space left on the device where Clickhouse stores its data

**Expected behavior**
I would expect the Clickhouse Kafka engine to not commit offsets for messages that were failed to persist to disk. This would allow the sysadmin to fix the underlying issues (insufficient disk space in our case) and after which Clickhouse would start 'backfilling' data from where it left off.
