Title: Filtering by a field joined with ANY LEFT JOIN works incorrectly
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Filtering by a field joined with `ANY LEFT JOIN` makes the query return only one matching row. This behavior was introduced in `v24.4`:

- v24.3 (works as expected) - https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/f38e3be9-a1e7-451d-9fc3-6e1d51d9f4b9
- v24.4 (doesn't work) - https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/5779a026-0d4d-44d4-98ef-2d842c9fbb50
- latest release (doesn't work) - https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/198bb819-3d17-49c0-a485-3534050336e9

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_country (
    user_id UInt64,
    country String,
    created_at DateTime DEFAULT now()
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(created_at)
ORDER BY user_id;

CREATE TABLE user_transactions (
    user_id UInt64,
    transaction_id String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY user_id;

INSERT INTO user_country (user_id, country) VALUES (1, 'US');
INSERT INTO user_transactions (user_id, transaction_id) VALUES (1, 'tx1'), (1, 'tx2'), (1, 'tx3'), (2, 'tx1');

-- Expected 3 rows, got only 1. Removing 'ANY' and adding 'FINAL' fixes
-- the issue (but it is not always possible). Moving filter by 'country' to
-- an outer query doesn't help. Query without filter by 'country' works
-- as expected (returns 3 rows).
SELECT * FROM user_transactions
ANY LEFT JOIN user_country USING (user_id)
WHERE
    user_id = 1
    AND country = 'US';

-- Expected
-- 1,"tx1","US","2024-07-12 16:04:17"
-- 1,"tx2","US","2024-07-12 16:04:17"
-- 1,"tx3","US","2024-07-12 16:04:17"

-- Got
-- 1,"tx1","US","2024-07-12 16:05:10"
```

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

**Expected behavior**

Filter by a field joined with `ANY LEFT JOIN` returns all matching rows.
