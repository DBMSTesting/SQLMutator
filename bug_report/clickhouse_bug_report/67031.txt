Title: clickhouse-client doesn't understand password in connection string
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Create a new installation, set a password to `1` for the `default` user, and try to connect with `clickhouse-client`:

```bash
clickhouse-client "clickhouse://default:1@127.0.0.1:9000/default"
ClickHouse client version 24.6.2.17 (official build).
Password for user (default):
```
This means it got the password:
```bash
clickhouse-client "clickhouse://default:1@127.0.0.1:9000/default" --password="1"
Bad arguments: option '--password' cannot be specified more than once
```

This works though:

```bash
clickhouse-client --password="1"
ClickHouse client version 24.6.2.17 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 24.6.2.
myuser :) 
```

This should work according to docs: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/cli#connection_string

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes on 24.6.2.17.

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use

24.6.2.17

* Which interface to use, if it matters

`clickhouse-client`

* Non-default settings, if any

Set a password on the `default` user.

**Expected behavior**

It should connect and not ask for password.
