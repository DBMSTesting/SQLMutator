Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the issue**
Date filter not working when table is partitioned by week. 

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server versions are incompatible 21.4.6
* Table definition - 
CREATE TABLE returns.test_tbl
(
    `vend_nm` String,
    `ship_dt` Date
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toWeek(ship_dt)
ORDER BY vend_nm
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192

Sample Data - 
insert into returns.test_tbl values('1', '2020-11-11')('1', '2021-01-01');

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
1.  select * From test_tbl where ship_dt>= toDate('2020-11-01') and ship_dt <= toDate('2021-05-05');
    This query returns no result. 
2. select * From test_tbl where ship_dt>= toDate('2020-01-01') and ship_dt <= toDate('2021-05-05');
    This query returns 1 record for date -  2021-01-01


This was working fine with version 20.5.3
