Title: CREATE USER: exitcode of 'cannot insert' exception is different than what is printed to user
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Whenever facing a 'cannot insert' error—for example, by creating user that already exists (without passing if not exists)—an error is given which has the rough format of the following:

```Code: 493. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: {type} `{name}`: cannot insert because {type} `{name}` already exists in [disk].```

This type of error makes sense. However, when testing, it seems that the actual underlying exitcode might not be 493, and instead is 237.

**How to reproduce**
```
ClickHouse client version 20.6.1.4066 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 20.6.1 revision 54436.

clicktest :) create user user0
CREATE USER user0
Ok.
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec. 

clicktest :) create user user0
CREATE USER user0

Received exception from server (version 20.6.1):
Code: 493. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: user `user0`: cannot insert because user `user0` already exists in [disk]. 
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec. 
```

We expect this above error. We see that the actual exitcode, however, is 237:

```

                                 echo -e "CREATE USER user0" | clickhouse client -n

                                          assert r.exitcode == exitcode, error(r.output)
                                          ^ is False
```
**Expected behavior**
I would expect the printed exit code and the actual exit code to be the same: either both 493, or both 237.
This seems to be consistent among all 'cannot insert' errors of this kind, which occur when creating a {user, row policy, quota, etc.} that already exists.
