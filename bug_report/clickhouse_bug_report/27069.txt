Title: XML config for user doesn't support names with dots.
Description:
You cannot create a user with XML config  if username contains a dot. But SQL access management allows it.

**How to reproduce**
Cretate a file `some_new_user.xml` in `/etc/clickhouse-server/users.d` and put there following content:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<yandex>
    <users>
        <vasya.pupkin>
		<password>1</password>
        </vasya.pupkin>
    </users>
</yandex>

```
Clickhouse-server will crash and put following message in error log:
```
2021.08.02 06:59:54.256008 [ 12747 ] {} <Error> Application: DB::Exception: Either 'password' or 'password_sha256_hex' or 'password_double_sha1_hex' or 'no_password' or 'ldap' or 'kerberos' must be specified for user vasya.pupkin.
```
* Which ClickHouse server version to use *
21.7.5.29

**SQL to create a user with a dot in a name**
```
CREATE USER vasya.pupkin HOST IP '0.0.0.0', '::/0' IDENTIFIED WITH no_password
```
