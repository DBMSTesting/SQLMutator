Title: The optimization for v23.6 leads to problems with using StorageJoin tables
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

We use tables of the Join table engine, after the upgrade from clickhouse 23.4 to 23.6 we encounter the issue with deadlock.
StorageJoin: cannot insert data because current query tries to read from this storage.

> A clear and concise description of what works not as it is supposed to.

actually this does not work anymore on v23.6
```
INSERT INTO {table1} 
  SELECT * 
  FROM {table2} 
  WHERE col NOT IN (
    SELECT col FROM {table1}
  );
```

the exact example
```
CREATE TABLE test_join
(
    `source` UInt64,
    `destination` String,
)
ENGINE = Join(ANY, LEFT, source);

CREATE TABLE test
(
    `source` String,
    `destination` String,
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY xxHash32(source) % 5
ORDER BY source
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

INSERT INTO test (source, destination)
  VALUES
  ('aaa1', 'aaa1'), ('aaa2', 'aaa2'), ('aaa3', 'aaa3');

INSERT INTO test_join
  SELECT xxHash64(source), destination
  FROM test
  WHERE xxHash64(source) NOT IN (
    SELECT source 
    FROM test_join
  );
```

the error is
`
Code: 473. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: StorageJoin: cannot insert data because current query tries to read from this storage. (DEADLOCK_AVOIDED)

on 23.5 - works
on 23.6 - does not work

it should just insert the data
