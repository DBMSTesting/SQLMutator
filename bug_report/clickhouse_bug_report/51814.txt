Title: `Nested` column type doesn't work in combination with `SimpleAggregateFunction` unless `flatten_nested=0`
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

Unless `flatten_nested=0` is set, `Nested` column types are turned into separate array columns.

Under both modes, it should be possible to create `SimpleAggregateFunction(<function>, Nested(..))` columns, but in the flattened mode this fails as the aggregate function is not retained.

See the fiddle with `set flatten_nested=0` where the aggregate function is retained and correctly updates (merges) the date: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/a3bd84d0-df57-4dbf-84a1-6bce2a2f9406

But without that setting, it fails: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/1bd9d48a-1bf5-4ec8-9e26-106310bd785a
```sql
create table test_simple_aggregate_nested(id Int8, n0 SimpleAggregateFunction(anyLast, Nested(a String,b String))) ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree() ORDER BY (id);

DESCRIBE TABLE test_simple_aggregate_nested;
```

gives:
```
id	Int8					
n0.a	Array(String)					
n0.b	Array(String)
```

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes


**How to reproduce**

See fiddle's above.


**Expected behavior**

`SimpleAggregateFunction` to be retained for the flattened array columns (and thus merging data correctly)
