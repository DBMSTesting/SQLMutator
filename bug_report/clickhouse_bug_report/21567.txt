Title: "max_concurrent_queries" setting change is not reflected in error message
Description:
I changed the `max_concurrent_queries` server settings in config.xml to 200 and restarted the Server, but I still get this error
```
DB::Exception: Too many simultaneous queries. Maximum: 100 (version 21.1.2.15 (official build))
```

I noticed an increased load on the machine so I am assuming the setting took effect but the number didn't change in the error message, any idea why the number didn't change?
