Title: Date type column as partition key can't correctly compare with DateTime type
Description:
SQL to reproduce:
```
create table test_datetime (dt Date, date materialized dt) Engine = MergeTree() partition by dt order by dt;
insert into test_datetime format JSONEachRow {"dt":"2019-10-23"};
select count() from test_datetime;
select count() from test_datetime where dt between toDateTime(toDate('2019-01-01')) and toDateTime(toDate('2019-12-31'));
select count() from test_datetime where date between toDateTime(toDate('2019-01-01')) and toDateTime(toDate('2019-12-31'));
```

The sql up here create a table partitioned by a Date type column dt and then insert one record. The first and last select query gets result `1`, and the second gets `0`.

Which tells us that **a Date type partition key cannot correctly compares with DateTime type values**.

tested on: 19.16.1.1(master) and 19.11.3.11
