Title: Is this an expected corrupt when an OOM occurs
Description:

Hi
Recently, I met a corrupt when the clickhouse server is killed because of OOM. The log shows that it may be caused by unjoined threads. It may be an expect behavior if the main thread is killed and the threads in thread pool have not joined. BUT, the problem is that a coredump need to write coredump file and it always slows the server. So, is this an expected corrupt and is there any ways to fix this problem.
