Title: Malformed MySQL packet
Description:
Sometimes ClickHouse forms invalid MySQL packet, and it crashes my Grafana instance (since it currently can't setup alerts via ClickHouse plugin I have to use MySQL interface)

Related issue in Go MySQL client:
https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/issues/1124

**How to reproduce**
- ClickHouse server version 20.4.4.18 (official build)
- MySQL interface
Failed query and result (via MySQL client):
```
SELECT
    intDiv(toInt32(datetime), 1000 / 1000.) * (1000 / 1000.) AS time,
    countIf(http_reply LIKE '5%%') AS `5xx`
FROM traf
WHERE (datetime >= 1591104676) AND (datetime <= 1591104696)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time ASC

Query OK, 99 rows affected, 29806 warnings (0.01 sec)
```

It's important to select datetime interval where no rows exist. According to ClickHouse log:
```

```

MySQL packet:
```
05 00 00 01 fe 00 00 00 00
```

and according to WireShark it is wrong:

```
MySQL Protocol
    Packet Length: 5
    Packet Number: 1
    EOF marker: 254
        [Expert Info (Warning/Protocol): EOF Marker found while connection in wrong state.]
            [EOF Marker found while connection in wrong state.]
            [Severity level: Warning]
            [Group: Protocol]
```
