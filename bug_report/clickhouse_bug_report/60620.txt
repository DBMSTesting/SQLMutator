Title: Query with FINAL doesn't return the last inserted row on duplicates
Description:
**Description**

After replacing the last value in a day with a different value, the last_value aggregation function will randomly return the second to last value instead, ignoring the replaced value at the end of the day. Using a daily window.
https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/298fe29c-156b-41ba-bee9-d391c03be67f
Tested on version 24.2.1.2248. On version 23.8 it always returns the correct value (1000 in the fiddle).

**Additional context**
- When running a ReplacingMergeTree without the is_deleted column it works correctly, i.e., always returns the value 1000 in the case of the fiddle. This applies to either using or not using an explicit version column.
- The problem happens even when no data is being marked as deleted with the is_deleted column.
- The fiddle should be run multiple times to see how it randomly returns either 1000 (correct value), 54.27 (second to last value) or 54.51 (third to last value).
- The SELECT queries are using FINAL.
- From my testing in the fiddle, the problem happens from version 24.1 onwards.

**Expected behavior**

It should always return the last value of each window.
