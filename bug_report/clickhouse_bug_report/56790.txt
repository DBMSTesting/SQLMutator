Title: The 'GLOBAL IN' clause doesn't work as expected with a subquery
Description:
I created a simple distributed table (3 shards) , inserted 100 rows and tried to execute the following query. 
I expected to get 100 rows, but the results contained fewer than 100 rows. It seems ClickHouse retrieved data only from 2 shards instead of all the shards.

(My original example is more complicated, so I've attached a simplified version of the problem below.)

**How to reproduce:**

ClickHouse version: 23.8.3.48

Create a distributed table and insert 100 rows:
```
CREATE TABLE test_local ON CLUSTER '{cluster}' (
    x Int64,
)
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree
ORDER BY (x);


CREATE TABLE test ON CLUSTER '{cluster}' AS test_local
ENGINE = Distributed('{cluster}', default, test_local, rand());


insert into test select * from numbers(100);
```
select the data from the table :
```
select * from test
where 'XXX' global in (select 'XXX');
```
Expected: 100 rows, but returned fewer.

**Expected behavior:** Return 100 rows.
