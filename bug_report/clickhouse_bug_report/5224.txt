Title: LowCardinality column does not work with IN with a single string
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Queries in form of `WHERE column IN ('a')` do not work against LowCardinality columns.

**How to reproduce**
Clickhouse: Branch 19.5 commit 73fe30870f67be565e2479a9d0a262c85fb13926 (A little further than 19.5.3.8 release)

Table:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.graphite (
  Path LowCardinality(String) CODEC(ZSTD),
  Value Float64 CODEC(Delta, ZSTD),
  Time UInt32 CODEC(Delta, ZSTD),
  Date Date CODEC(Delta, ZSTD),
  Timestamp UInt32 CODEC(Delta, ZSTD)
) ENGINE = GraphiteMergeTree('graphite_rollup')
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(Date)
ORDER BY (Path, Time);
```

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
:) SELECT * FROM graphite WHERE Path IN ('a');
DB::Exception: Set for IN is not created yet.

:) SELECT * FROM graphite WHERE Path IN = 'a';
...works...

:) SELECT * FROM graphite WHERE Path IN ('a', 'b');
...works...
```

**Expected behavior**
It should work.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
`DB::Exception: Set for IN is not created yet.`
