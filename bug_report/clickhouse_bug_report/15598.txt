Title: A table keep turning into read-only mode
Description:
I am facing a strange behavior with ClickHouse.

One of the replicas keep turning into readonly mode. I am detecting this by pinging the server as follows:
```
$ curl localhost:8123/replicas_status

Code: 242, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Table is in readonly mode (version 20.5.2.7 (official build))
```

The strange behavior is that when I query `system.metrics` table I found that `ReadonlyReplica` metric have value of 0.

```
SELECT
    metric,
    value
FROM system.metrics
WHERE metric = 'ReadonlyReplica'

┌─metric──────────┬─value─┐
│ ReadonlyReplica │     0 │
└─────────────────┴───────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
```

And even more, I can do `INSERT` queries to this replica without problems.

When I restart the server and ping it, it returns `Ok`. But after couple of hours, it fall back to the same behavior.
