**Describe the bug**
I'm using clickhouse 20.10.6.27 version, mysql 8.0.21 version.
Using mysql to connect to Clickhouse, cannot execute another command after executing this command（use database）

mysql> use test;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
mysql> show tables;
