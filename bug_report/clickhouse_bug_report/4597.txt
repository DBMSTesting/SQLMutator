Title: Set system.dictionaries.last_exception when invalidate_query fails
Description:
I have a dictionary with an invalidate query, and this query sometimes returns nothing.
I can see an exception in the log, but system.dictionaries.last_exception for this dictionary is empty.
I guess it should reflect that something is not working.
Here is the log:
```
2019.03.05 14:46:24.369771 [ 28 ] {} <Trace> ClickHouseDictionarySource: Performing invalidate query
2019.03.05 14:46:24.371323 [ 28 ] {} <Error> ExternalDictionaries: Cannot check if the 'dict_name' external dictionary need to be updated: Code: 295, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Empty response
```
