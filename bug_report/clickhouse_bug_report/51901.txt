Title: Problem with query plan optimizer yielding incorrect results
Description:
After upgrading ClickHouse server, one of our queries started returning incorrect results due to a problem with query plan optimizations. The issue was first introduced in `v22.4` and I believe it's related to this PR: #35623.

Consider the following query:

```SQL
SELECT
    Dim,
    CumulativeSum
FROM
(
    SELECT
        Dim,
        runningAccumulate(SumState) AS CumulativeSum
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            Dim,
            sumState(DimCount) AS SumState
        FROM
        (
            SELECT
                c1 AS Dim,
                count() as DimCount
            FROM VALUES(9, 5, 5, 2, 1, 1)
            GROUP BY Dim
        )
        GROUP BY Dim
        ORDER BY Dim DESC
    )
)
ORDER BY Dim ASC
```

The correct results of this query should be:

```
┌─Dim─┬─CumulativeSum─┐
│   1 │             6 │
│   2 │             4 │
│   5 │             3 │
│   9 │             1 │
└─────┴───────────────┘
```

But starting from v22.4, ClickHouse query plan optimizer decides to calculate `runningAccumulate` after sorting which ruins the cumulative sum and gives incorrect results.

[ClickHouse Playground v22.3](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/c77e6c20-830b-413b-ad78-3d9e59707a4f) (gives correct results)
[ClickHouse Playground v22.4](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/c2a08315-2850-425e-bf9b-189ff3200f0b) (gives incorrect results)

Note that by setting `query_plan_enable_optimizations=0`, the query gives correct results which indicates the issue is related to the query plan optimizer.
