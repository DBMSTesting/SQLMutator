Title: Incorrect parsing of setting value between mixed versions
Description:
The problem is only occurs in mixed versions. After some changes default value for settings is unquoted in `24.9.1.948`:
```
hostname():  c-desert-vm-43-server-6xhac3m-0
version():   24.9.1.948
name:        max_parsing_threads
value:       auto(5)
default:     auto(5) 
```
but before it was in quotes:
```
hostname():  c-desert-vm-43-server-lag7hui-0
version():   24.7.1.28300
name:        max_parsing_threads
value:       'auto(5)'
default:     'auto(5)'
```
With 2 instances on `24.7.1.28300` and 1 on `24.9.1.948` when this query is executed on `24.7.1.28300` it sends quoted setting value `'auto(5)'` to `24.9.1.948` server which incorrectly parse it: 
```
SELECT
    hostname(),
    http_user_agent
FROM clusterAllReplicas(default, 'system', query_log)
WHERE query_id = '05c1c92c-2555-44b0-bbb4-e64bee0cb605'

Query id: 2a4a1f2b-896e-46f1-aa79-c76bfbd576db

Received exception from server (version 24.7.1):
Code: 27. DB::Exception: Received from desert-vm-43-us-east-2-aws-stg.tail983ac.ts.net:9440. DB::Exception: Received from c-desert-vm-43-server-6xhac3m-0.c-desert-vm-43-server-headless.ns-desert-vm-43.svc.cluster.local:9000. DB::Exception: Cannot parse input: expected 'eof' before: '\'auto(5)\''. (CANNOT_PARSE_INPUT_ASSERTION_FAILED)

```

So when executing query from `24.7.1.28300` it sends quoted settings value and `24.9.1.948` can't parse it because it expect unquoted value.
But when executing query vice versa from `24.9.1.948` query works.
