Title: ClickHouse doesn't pass process name to log messages while logging to syslog.
Description:
If I configure ClickHouse to log to syslog (`<use_syslog>true</use_syslog>`), then syslog messages have no process name in them. For example journalctl shows this messages:
```
Dec 28 00:32:56 localhost [917]: 2019.12.28 00:32:56.006167 [ 1 ] {} <Information> : Starting ClickHouse 19.17.2.4 with revision 54428
Dec 28 00:32:56 localhost [917]: 2019.12.28 00:32:56.014531 [ 1 ] {} <Information> Application: starting up
```
Process name supposed to be before pid (`[917]`) but it is not. I thing this is because in this line (https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/v19.17.2.4-stable/libs/libloggers/loggers/Loggers.cpp#L123):
```
            syslog_channel->setProperty(Poco::SyslogChannel::PROP_NAME, cmd_name);
```
`cmd_name` is equal to empty string (it's default value: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/v19.17.2.4-stable/libs/libloggers/loggers/Loggers.h#L17)

Also, as you can see Poco::SyslogChannel uses it's own log message format with it's own timestamp, priority, etc. The result is timestamp doubling in syslog message.

ClickHouse version: 19.17.2.4
