Title: Regression in match behavior when upgrading from 22.8.17 to 23.3.2
Description:
**Describe the issue**

In our unit tests we have a query that is using `match` that was passing in 22.8 LTS but fails in 23.3 LTS. I've managed to reproduce the problem just using `select match(...)`, see below for an example.

**How to reproduce**

With the following image for 22.8, `docker.io/clickhouse/clickhouse-server:22.8.17.17-alpine` , this query returns `1` as expected:
```
45d39cc56d5a :) SELECT version(), match('default/k8s1', '\\A(?:(?:[-0-9_a-z]+(?:\\.[-0-9_a-z]+)*)/k8s1)\\z') as found;

SELECT
    version(),
    match('default/k8s1', '\\A(?:(?:[-0-9_a-z]+(?:\\.[-0-9_a-z]+)*)/k8s1)\\z') AS found

│ 22.8.17.17 │     1 │
└────────────┴───────┘

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec.
```

With the following image for 23.3 `docker.io/clickhouse/clickhouse-server:23.3.2.37-alpine`, the query returns 0, which we do not expect:

```
45d39cc56d5a :) SELECT version(), match('default/k8s1', '\\A(?:(?:[-0-9_a-z]+(?:\\.[-0-9_a-z]+)*)/k8s1)\\z') as found;

SELECT
    version(),
    match('default/k8s1', '\\A(?:(?:[-0-9_a-z]+(?:\\.[-0-9_a-z]+)*)/k8s1)\\z') AS found

ClickHouse client version is older than ClickHouse server. It may lack support for new features.

I've gone looking through the changelog for version 23 and have tried setting a few settings related to the regex, but nothing has made a difference, and I haven't found any PRs so far that would potentially cause this.
