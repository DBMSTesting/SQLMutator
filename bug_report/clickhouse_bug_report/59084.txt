Title: S3 request with non existing URL hanging forever
Description:
When running a `INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3` and passing a URL that doesn't exist, for example, using a wrong AWS region like in the following examples:

```sql
INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://my-bucket.s3.fake-region.amazonaws.com/export_1234.csv.gz', 'a', '', 'CSV') SELECT 1
```

or

```sql
BACKUP TABLE test TO S3('https://my-bucket.s3.fake-region.amazonaws.com/export_1234.csv.gz', '', '')
```

The queries hang forever. See a comparison between 23.3 and 24.1 (master)

23.3.1.2823

```
$ time ./23.3.1.2823/clickhouse local --query "INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://my-bucket.s3.fake-region.amazonaws.com/export_1234.csv.gz', 'a', '', 'CSV') SELECT 1"
Code: 499. DB::Exception: Could not list objects in bucket 'my-bucket' with key 'export_1234.csv.gz', S3 exception: ``, message: 'Code: 198. DB::Exception: Not found address of host: my-bucket.s3.fake-region.amazonaws.com. (DNS_ERROR) (version 23.3.1.2823 (official build))'. (S3_ERROR)

real	25.751
user	0.100
sys	0.029
```

24.1.1.1536 (master)

```
$ time ./master/clickhouse local --query "INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://my-bucket.s3.fake-region.amazonaws.com/export_1234.csv.gz', 'a', '', 'CSV') SELECT 1"
^C^C
real	4:11.52
user	1.172
sys	0.030
```

(I have stopped the query after 4 minutes)

You can see the following logs when running the same query on a server. The request keeps returning timeout and gets retried forever due to a DNS error (expected since the URL shouldn't exist)
