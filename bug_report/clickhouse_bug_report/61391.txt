Title: Error when using multiple NTILE() function calls with identical ORDER BY clause in a single query
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

There's an error when a query contains multiple `NTILE()` function calls with identical `ORDER BY` clauses.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes.

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 24.2.1.2248
* Which interface to use, if it matters: JDBC, but doesn't matter
* Non-default settings, if any: N/A

Run this query:

```sql
select 
  ntile(1) over (order by id) as a,
  ntile(2) over (order by id) as b
from (select 1 as id) as t;
```

**Expected behavior**

It should produce this result:

```
|a  |b  |
|---|---|
|1  |1  |
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

> Received exception from server (version 24.2.1):
Code: 36. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Window frame for function 'ntile' should be 'ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING'. (BAD_ARGUMENTS)
(query: select 
  ntile(1) over (order by id),
  ntile(2) over (order by id)
from (select 1 as id) as t;)


**Workaround**

Use a different `ORDER BY` clause, e.g.:

```sql
select 
  ntile(1) over (order by id) as a,
  ntile(2) over (order by id + 0) as b
from (select 1 as id) as t;
```

Or, use an explicit frame clause:

```sql

Use a different `ORDER BY` clause, e.g.:

```sql
select 
  ntile(1) over (order by id rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as a,
  ntile(2) over (order by id rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as b
from (select 1 as id) as t;
```
