Title: String comparison in where clause not working properly
Description:
This seems only related to JDBC/ODBC bridge, as `select * from (select 's' as s) where s = 's'` works but not `select * from jdbc('ch', '', 'select ''s'' as s') where s = 's'`. The same issue exists in both 19.11.8.46 and 19.16.10.44. A possible workaround is to explicitly convert the field to String first, for example: `toString(s) = 's'` or `concat(s, '') = 's'`.

To reproduce:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zhicwu/clickhouse-jdbc-bridge-test.git
$ cd clickhouse-jdbc-bridge-test
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose exec ch-server clickhouse-client
ClickHouse client version 19.16.10.44 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 19.16.10 revision 54427.
