Exception throwing when using the `percent_rank` (https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62747) window function function

Launch ClickHouse and create table with some data:

```sql
$ ./clickhouse -m
...
ClickHouse local version 24.8.1.937 (official build).

:) CREATE TABLE salaries ORDER BY team AS
SELECT *
FROM url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClickHouse/examples/main/LearnClickHouseWithMark/WindowFunctions-Ranking/data/salaries.csv')
SETTINGS schema_inference_make_columns_nullable=0;

CREATE TABLE salaries
ORDER BY team
AS SELECT *
FROM url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClickHouse/examples/main/LearnClickHouseWithMark/WindowFunctions-Ranking/data/salaries.csv')
SETTINGS schema_inference_make_columns_nullable = 0

Query id: 9a1871ae-4dea-43fe-8f27-e54b40c6e5d2

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 2.080 sec. Processed 250.00 thousand rows, 11.25 MB (120.18 thousand rows/s., 5.41 MB/s.)
Peak memory usage: 46.00 MiB.
```

And then compute various ranks:

```sql
:) FROM salaries
SELECT *,
       row_number() OVER () AS rowNum,
       rank() OVER (ORDER BY weeklySalary DESC) AS rank,
       dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY weeklySalary DESC) AS denseRank,
       percent_rank() OVER (ORDER BY weeklySalary DESC) AS percentRank
LIMIT 10;

SELECT
    *,
    row_number() OVER () AS rowNum,
    rank() OVER (ORDER BY weeklySalary DESC) AS rank,
    dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY weeklySalary DESC) AS denseRank,
    percent_rank() OVER (ORDER BY weeklySalary DESC) AS percentRank
FROM salaries
LIMIT 10
