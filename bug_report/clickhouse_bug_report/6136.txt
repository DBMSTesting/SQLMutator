Title: bitmapContains throws DB::Exception
Description:
**Describe the bug**
`bitmapContains` throws DB::Exception:
```
DB::Exception: Key expression contains comparison between inconvertible types: UInt32 and AggregateFunction(groupBitmap, UInt64) inside bitmapContains(CAST(('AggregateFunction(groupBitmap, UInt64)')'
```
**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
Master branch of ClickHouse will throw the exception, but the query works well using version of `v19.11.2.7-stable`

* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
Using the sample New York Taxi data, schema [here](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/getting_started/example_datasets/nyc_taxi/)
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
SELECT count(*) FROM trips WHERE bitmapContains((SELECT groupBitmapState(id) FROM trips WHERE pickup_datetime>'2017-06-24 00:00:00'), toUInt32(id));
```
or simpler query:
```
SELECT count(*) FROM trips WHERE bitmapContains(bitmapBuild([1, 5, 7, 9]), toUInt32(id));
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
DB::Exception: Key expression contains comparison between inconvertible types: UInt32 and AggregateFunction(groupBitmap, UInt64) inside bitmapContains(CAST(('AggregateFunction(groupBitmap, UInt64)')'
```
