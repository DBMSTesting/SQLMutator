Title: ALTER timeout on ReplicatedMergeTree
Description:
On release 18.16.0, when applying ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN on ReplicatedMergeTree table, ALTER completed on current replica, but other replicas coudn't download and apply ALTER action.

On ALTER we see this error:
> Alter is not finished because timeout when waiting for some replicas: site2-deac-dwh-cas3 (replication_alter_columns_timeout = 60). Alter will be done asynchronously.
> IN:ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... Int64

In Clickhouse error logs when each replica starts, started to  appear multiple (~1-2 each minute) errors (on release 18.16.0):
> 2018.12.20 13:54:11.661354 [ 17 ] {} <Error> ...Turnovers (StorageReplicatedMergeTree): DB::StorageReplicatedMergeTree::queueTask()::<lambda(DB::StorageReplicatedMergeTree::LogEntryPtr&)>: Poco::Exception. Code: 1000,
> e.code() = 0, e.displayText() = No message received, e.what() = No message received

After replicas restart, ALTER applies on all other replicas, new ALTER works fine, but after 10-20 minutes replicas work, new ALTER will hang again.

Number of replicas = 3, quorum write used (insert_quorum=2), replication_alter_partitions_sync = 2. Problem first  appeared on server version: 18.16.0, on 18.14.11 all is ok.

Tried to increase http_connection_timeout to 15, but it was useless.
