Title: Querying of system.tables become quite slow after upgrading from 1.1.54380
Description:
After upgrading from version 1.1.54380 to latest(and also tried several recent versions), I come across a performance issue when query table `system.tables`.

For a database with 3000 tables, query time increased from 0.005 sec to 0.255 sec.

And here is the repo to reproduce the issue: https://github.com/ddliu/clickhouse-tune
