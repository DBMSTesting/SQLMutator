Title: Unknown identifier in IN section
Description:
```
SELECT 1 x FROM (select 1) group by 1 HAVING x in 
( SELECT countIf(y, z == 1) FROM (SELECT 1 y, 1 z) )

Received exception from server (version 19.4.1):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. 
DB::Exception: Unknown identifier: z.
```

but if  replace `in` with `=`
```
SELECT 1 x FROM (select 1) group by 1 HAVING x = 
(( SELECT countIf(y, z == 1) FROM (SELECT 1 y, 1 z) ))
┌─x─┐
│ 1 │
└───┘
```

--------------------------------------------------------
Query with `having` without  `group by` returns a wrong result:

```
SELECT 1 x FROM (select 1) t  HAVING x = 1;
**0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.009 sec.**
```

The same query MYSQL:
```
mysql> SELECT 1 x FROM (select 1) t  HAVING x = 1;
+---+
| x |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

CH with group by
```
SELECT 1 x FROM (select 1) t group by 1  HAVING x = 1;
┌─x─┐
│ 1 │
└───┘
```
