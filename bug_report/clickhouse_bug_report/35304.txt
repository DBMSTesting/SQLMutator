Title: Using UInt64 with partition using toYYYYMMDD produces empty result on queries filtering against negative values
Description:
**Describe the issue**
A table that includes a field with UInt64 and uses that field to create partition using toYYYYMMDD fails to return values when doing a query for values larger than -1. This used to work in ClickHouse version 20.8.7.15 and it is currently broken in version 22.2.3.1 resulting in broken code.

**Which ClickHouse server versions are incompatible**
Versions 20.8.7.15 and 22.2.3.1

**How to reproduce**
Create table and insert data:
```
CREATE TABLE broken ( time UInt64 ) ENGINE = MergeTree PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(toDate(time / 1000)) ORDER BY time;
INSERT INTO broken (time) VALUES (1647353101000), (1647353101001), (1647353101002), (1647353101003);
```

Run the following queries:
```
SELECT * FROM broken WHERE time>0;
SELECT * FROM broken WHERE time>-1;
```

The first query returns all records, the second one returns empty result.
