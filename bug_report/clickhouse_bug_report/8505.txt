Title: max_execution_time ignored on non-system tables.
Description:
Setting `max_execution_time` seemingly only works on the `system.numbers` table, which is the only table that the setting is tested on.

A simple test can be done on one of our access log tables.

```bash
$ clickhouse-client -t --max_execution_time 1 -q 'SELECT uniq(_date) FROM clicktail.access_log WHERE _date = today()';
1
4.445
```

```bash
$ clickhouse-client -t --max_execution_time 1 -q 'SELECT count() from system.numbers';
Received exception from server (version 19.17.6):
Code: 159. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Timeout exceeded: elapsed 1.000091896 seconds, maximum: 1.
0.998
```

This has been tested on both 19.17.6.36 and 19.17.4.11.

Let me know if you need any additional information.
