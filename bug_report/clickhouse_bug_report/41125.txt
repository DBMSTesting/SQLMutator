Title: a decimal type issue when use 'IN' in where clause
Description:
A decimal column comparasion has some unexpected results.

**How to reproduce**
CH version is 22.8.4.7
table schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE default.dtest
(
    `a` Decimal(18, 0),
    `b` Decimal(18, 1),
    `c` Decimal(36, 0)
)
ENGINE = Memory;
```

insert a row with
```sql
insert into dtest values(33,44.4,35);
```

then make a query: 
```sql
select * from dtest where a in toDecimal32(33.3000,4);
```

we get :
```
┌──a─┬────b─┬──c─┐
│ 33 │ 44.4 │ 35 │
└────┴──────┴────┘
```

that is not reasonable ,right? but when replace 'in' with '=',the result will be empty and that is correct
and this case seems to happen only when the scale of decimal type is 0.

any idea is welcome  :-)
