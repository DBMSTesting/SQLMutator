Title: selecting columns explectInvalid results returned when using explicit columns names instead of * in SELECT query with NULL rows
Description:
version used 
```sql
SELECT version(); -- 24.5.3.5
```

Use case : 
Trying to replicate the **EXCEPT ALL** logic supported by some other DBs like Postgres
Removing intersecting rows (without deleting more rows than that exists in the other table)
```sql
-- THE RESULT CTE RETURNS 1 ROW WITH ALL COLUMN VALUES NULL. WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR
WITH T1 AS (SELECT 1 A, 1 B UNION ALL SELECT 1 A, 1 B), 
T2 AS (SELECT 1 A, 1 B),
T1_WITH_ROWNUM AS (SELECT A, B, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A, B ORDER BY A, B) RNK FROM T1),
T2_WITH_ROWNUM AS (SELECT A, B, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A, B ORDER BY A, B) RNK FROM T2),
RESULT AS (SELECT * FROM T1_WITH_ROWNUM EXCEPT SELECT * FROM T2_WITH_ROWNUM)
SELECT * FROM RESULT; -- RETURNS 1 RESULT

  A   B   RNK  
 --- --- ----- 
  1   1   2    
```
```sql
-- HOWEVER UPON EXPLICITLY USING COLUMN NAMES RATHER THAN *,  NO RESULTS IN THE OUTPUT
WITH T1 AS (SELECT 1 A, 1 B UNION ALL SELECT 1 A, 1 B), 
T2 AS (SELECT 1 A, 1 B),
T1_WITH_ROWNUM AS (SELECT A, B, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A, B ORDER BY A, B) RNK FROM T1),
T2_WITH_ROWNUM AS (SELECT A, B, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY A, B ORDER BY A, B) RNK FROM T2),
RESULT AS (SELECT * FROM T1_WITH_ROWNUM EXCEPT SELECT * FROM T2_WITH_ROWNUM)
SELECT A,B FROM RESULT; -- RETURNS NO RESULT
-- RETURNS NO RESULT

-- EXPECTED RESULTED TO BE 
  A   B  
 --- --- 
  1   1  

```
