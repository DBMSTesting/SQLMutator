Title: http_timeout value for clickhouse-odbc-bridge is too large
Description:
clickhouse-odbc-bridge starts with the following parameters:
/usr/bin/clickhouse-odbc-bridge odbc-bridge --http-port 9018 --listen-host localhost --http-timeout 1800000000

Value for http_timeout is hardcoded in sources and too large, so dictionaries are not working properly. 
If we launch it manually with lower value:
/usr/bin/clickhouse-odbc-bridge odbc-bridge --http-port 9018 --listen-host localhost --http-timeout 600
dictionaries are working properly.

Latest stable version 19.5.3.8 and testing 19.6.1.357 are affected.
