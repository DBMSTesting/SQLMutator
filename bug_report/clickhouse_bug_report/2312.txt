Title: Views with subqueries don't rewrite simple table names
Description:
If you create a view with a sub-query that uses a simple table name, it is not rewritten with the database name.

So it works when the current database is the same it was created in:

    :) create database test
    :) use test
    :) create view whoami as select 1 as n
    :) create view tellme as select * from whoami
    :) create view tellme_nested as select * from (select * from whoami)
    :) select * from tellme

    ┌─n─┐
    │ 1 │
    └───┘

    :) select * from tellme_nested

    ┌─n─┐
    │ 1 │
    └───┘

But not in another database:

    :) use default
    :) select * from test.tellme

    ┌─n─┐
    │ 1 │
    └───┘

    :) select * from test.tellme_nested

    Received exception from server (version 1.1.54370):
    Code: 60. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1. DB::Exception: Table default.whoami doesn't exist..
