Description:
**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Reproduces on master.

**How to reproduce**

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt2;

CREATE TABLE tt1 (a UInt32, b UInt32 ALIAS 0) ENGINE = Memory;
CREATE TABLE tt2 (a UInt32, b UInt32 ALIAS 0) ENGINE = Memory;
CREATE TABLE tt_m (a UInt32, b UInt32) ENGINE = Merge(currentDatabase(), 'tt1|tt2');

INSERT INTO tt1 VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO tt1 VALUES (2);
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM tt_m;

┌─a─┬─b─┐
│ 1 │ 0 │
└───┴───┘
┌─a─┬─b─┐
│ 2 │ 0 │
└───┴───┘
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM tt_m WHERE b != 0;

Received exception from server (version 21.11.1):
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column b in block. There are only columns: a. (NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK)
