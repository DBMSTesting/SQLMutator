Title: Number of columns in section IN doesn't match. 2 at left, 1 at right (NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS_DOESNT_MATCH)
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

The following query works as expected:
```sql
SELECT 
  number AS a,
  number AS b
FROM numbers(100)
WHERE (a,b) IN (
  SELECT (number, number) FROM numbers(100)
)
```
But if one of the columns in the subquery is in the index, it doesn't work:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY a AS
SELECT
    number AS a,
    number AS b
FROM numbers(100);

SELECT *
FROM test
WHERE (a, b) IN (
    SELECT (a, b)
    FROM test
)

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.008 sec.

Received exception from server (version 22.9.3):
Code: 20. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. 
DB::Exception: Number of columns in section IN doesn't match. 2 at left, 1 at right.. (NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS_DOESNT_MATCH)

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes


**Additional context**

Setting `use_index_for_in_with_subqueries=0` makes it work (https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/0f000fef-a05e-425f-b849-4d4df297d4e3): 
```sql
CREATE TABLE test
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY a AS
SELECT
    number AS a,
    number AS b
FROM numbers(100);

SELECT *
FROM test
WHERE (a, b) IN (
    SELECT (a, b)
    FROM test
) SETTINGS use_index_for_in_with_subqueries=0;
```
