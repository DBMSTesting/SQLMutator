Title: Protobuf autogenerate creates invalid schemas.
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

**Describe what's wrong**

> When using Protobuf as output format without a schema, the autogenerate schema creates a new wrong schema with colums whcih contain elemets such as: `_1`, `_0_`. The columns that contain a `_` are nested. In the case of having numbers, the field name becomes a number. This is ilegal. And I get an error of parsing.

> A link to reproducer in [colums with _1](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/9390e6d8-ba18-41e9-a892-7c8eee78b086).

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes. I am testing with the latest version at the moment. 

**How to reproduce**
The behavior is reproduced in this small snippet: [protobuff over colums with _1](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/9390e6d8-ba18-41e9-a892-7c8eee78b086).

**Expected behavior**

> I am not sure whether it exists an option to create a protobuf schema which is not nested. If this is not the case. This is a bug. And I would expect clickhose to have a proper protobuf schema. 

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
