Title: ClickHouse doesn't work correctly with sql aliases.
Description:
Latest actual ClickHouse version:
We are getting a column mismatch error when using sql alias in JOIN query. But if you add the database prefix 'default', then the same query will work. And this is really weird! After all, the error was not talking about this at all and we were already in 'default'.
You can reproduce the bug using docker-compose here:

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW competitors_one_day_test
(
             `lemma` String,
             `city` UInt32,
             `date` DateTime,
             `packets` Array(UInt32)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (date, city)
POPULATE
AS SELECT
    any(lemma),
    city,
    date,
    arrayReduce('groupUniqArray', groupArray(packet))
FROM
    (SELECT lemma, city, date, packet
