Title: Import CSV after login into clickhouse client console or using JDBC client produes error 
Description:
I exported csv file from a particular table using OUTFILE and trying same to import from same file produces following error
 Code: 27. DB::Exception: Cannot parse input: expected , at end of stream.: (at row 1)
After login into console tried to do it using same query that I used to import without login to console client that successfully imports the data..

Also tried to do it using jdbc client also produces the same error..

Attaching screenshot for same..

Is there any way i can achieve it i can export data from table by login into clickhouse console or using jdbc client but need same for import..
