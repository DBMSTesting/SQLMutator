Title: `Data compressed with different methods` if column name match expression from other column
Description:
**Describe the bug**

```
select 2 as `toString(x)`, x from (select 1 as x);
```
In debug it would be `LOGICAL_ERROR`
```
Code: 271, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Data compressed with different methods, given method byte 0x69, previous method byte 0x82: while receiving packet from localhost:9000, Stack trace (when copying this message, always include the lines below):
```

If types match, no error, but result is unexpected:
```
select '2' as `toString(x)`, toString(x) from (select 1 as x);

┌─toString(x)─┬─toString(x)─┐
│ 2           │ 2           │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```
