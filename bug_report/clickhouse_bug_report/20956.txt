Title: clickhouse-copier: Query was executed on 1 nodes. But had to be executed on 140652833010201
Description:
That looks like a bug:
```
There was an error while executing ALTER on each node. Query was executed on 1 nodes. But had to be executed on 140652833010201
Number of nodes that executed ALTER query successfully : 1
Number of shard that executed OPTIMIZE DEDUPLICATE query successfully : 1
```

I will provide more details once I will get it.
