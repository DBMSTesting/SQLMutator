Title: query_log has no exceptions logged for asynchronous inserts
Description:
#51160 introduced events from `asynchronous_insert_log` into `query_log` which is very nice!

Unfortunately if exception happens at the flush time that exception is not logged to the `query_log`
It's still logged to `asynchronous_insert_log` though, which is good, but it limits the usage of `query_log` for async insert monitoring.

To repro:
```sql
create table t1 (id UInt32, ts DateTime64) engine = MergeTree order by tuple();
insert into t1 settings async_insert = 1, wait_for_async_insert = 0, async_insert_busy_timeout_ms = 1000 format Values (1, '9th November 2024 09:15')
```

The entry will be present in `asynchronous_insert_log`:
```
exception:               DB::Exception: Cannot parse string '9th November 2023 09:15' as DateTime64(3): syntax error at position 10 (parsed just '9th Novemb'): while executing 'FUNCTION if(isNull(_dummy_0) : 3, defaultValueOfTypeName('DateTime64(3)') :: 2, _CAST(_dummy_0, 'DateTime64(3)') :: 4) -> if(isNull(_dummy_0), defaultValueOfTypeName('DateTime64(3)'), _CAST(_dummy_0, 'DateTime64(3)')) DateTime64(3) : 1'
```
But in `query_log` the entry for `query_kind = 'AsyncInsertFlush' and type = 'QueryFinish'` will not be logged. 

version tested: 24.1.5.6
