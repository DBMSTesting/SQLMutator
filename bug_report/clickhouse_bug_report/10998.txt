Title: Issues when use S3 when using Amazon bucket
Description:
2 blocker issues with AWS s3:
1) can't parse one of the (proper) URL format (`Bucket name length out of bounds in S3 URI`)
i.e. (https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bucketname/).
2) can't login to non default region `AuthorizationHeaderMalformed: the region 'XXXX' is wrong; expecting 'YYYY'`  (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/issues/1057)

And 3rd (rather minor/cosmetic/need to be rechecked):
not showing the real error / reason of the issue here:
