Title: User expiration (VALID UNTIL clause) disappears after server restart
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**
When you create an [expiring user](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user#valid-until-clause) with `CREATE USER ... VALID UNTIL`, then restart ClickHouse, the VALID UNTIL clause disappears, even if the restart occurs after the user has already expired.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Reproduces on 24.5.3 and 24.3.3.

**How to reproduce**
Run ClickHouse with a default setup, and [enable SQL-driven access control](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/access-rights#enabling-access-control). Then do the following:

1.
  ```sql
CREATE USER test VALID UNTIL '1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC';
SHOW CREATE USER test;

--┌─CREATE USER test───────────────────────────────────┐
--│ CREATE USER test VALID UNTIL '1970-01-01 00:00:01' │
--└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```
2. Attempt to log in as the test user (`clickhouse client --user test`), observe that it prompts for a password and always fails.
3. Restart ClickHouse.
4. Try to log in as the test user, observe that it now succeeds.
5. Observe that the VALID UNTIL clause has disappeared from the CREATE USER statement.
  ```sql
SHOW CREATE USER test;

--┌─CREATE USER test─┐
--│ CREATE USER test │
--└──────────────────┘
  ```

**Expected behavior**
The VALID UNTIL clause should be preserved across server restarts, and logins to expired users should not succeed.

**Additional context**
I've noticed that specifying a VALID UNTIL clause with Unix time 0 ('1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC') is the same as the default when you specify nothing ('infinity'), so I'm guessing there's some time field on the user instance that's being zero-initialized and not properly populated when the user is reloaded at startup.
