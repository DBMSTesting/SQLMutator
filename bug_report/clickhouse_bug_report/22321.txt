Title: incorrect frame in window func
Description:
hello

i use uniqExact(uid) for count cumulative uniqs, and use window frame as UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

if i use in window parameter PARTITION BY field with correct values, then everything works good

but if i remove PARTITION BY, and want the table to be a single partition with window frame UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

then the behavior of the window frame changes as if i set it from the beginning to the end of the section (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
