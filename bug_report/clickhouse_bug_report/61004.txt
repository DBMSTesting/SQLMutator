Title: Error when using COUNT(*) with FILTER clause
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

When using `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ..)`, there's an error

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

**How to reproduce**

* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 24.2.1.2248
* Which interface to use, if it matters: JDBC (doesn't matter though)
* Non-default settings, if any: N/A

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (uid Int16, name String, age Int16) ENGINE=Memory;

INSERT INTO users VALUES (1231, 'John', 33);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (6666, 'Ksenia', 48);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (8888, 'Alice', 50);

SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE uid > 2000)
FROM users;
```

See: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/04662903-5a44-4af5-b40e-8278fa011682

**Expected behavior**

The query works

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

> Received exception from server (version 24.2.1):
> Code: 42. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Aggregate function count requires zero or one argument. (NUMBER_OF_ARGUMENTS_DOESNT_MATCH)
(query: SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE uid > 2000)
FROM users;)

**Workaround**

Run this query instead:

```sql
SELECT count(1) FILTER (WHERE uid > 2000)
FROM users;
```
