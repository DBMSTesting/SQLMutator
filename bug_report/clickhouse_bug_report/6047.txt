Title: clickhouse mysql interface bug
Description:
step 1, mysql client connect to clickhouse
step 2,  select xxxxx from mysql(...  table1 ...)
             select xxxxx from mysql(...  table2 ...)
step 3, show processlist in mysql server
            you will find exits two connections from clickhouse server (expect 0  connection because sql is end ), these connections won't release util mysql client exit

these things won't happen if i use clickhouse-client
