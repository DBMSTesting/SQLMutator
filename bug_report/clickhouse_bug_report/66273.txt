Title: MaterializedPostgreSQL connection breaks on column changes in postgres after restart
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

When running Clickhouse with MaterializedPostgreSQL everything is working fine, until we had to restart our Postgres instance. It seems like the MaterializedPostgreSQL tables are not being updated anymore.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes

**Enable crash reporting**

LOGICAL_ERROR	49	492	2024-07-09 12:39:56	Columns number mismatch. Attributes: 17, buffer: 20	

**How to reproduce**

1. Setup a MaterializedPostgreSQL database:
```
SET allow_experimental_database_materialized_postgresql=1;
CREATE DATABASE postgres_tables ENGINE = MaterializedPostgreSQL('host:port', 'database', 'user', 'password') SETTINGS materialized_postgresql_tables_list = 'Table1,Table2,Table3...' FORMAT JSON;
```
2. See that the table are being populated
3. Remove a column from one of the tracked tables
4. Restart Postgres instance (not sure if this is required, but it seems like it)
5. BINGO: No more updates in the postgres_tables database

**Expected behavior**

I expect Clickhouse to handle the changes in columns as I now have to set up everything again from scratch.
