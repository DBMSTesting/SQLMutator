**How to reproduce**

CREATE TABLE test_table (Id Int32, Foo Int32) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY Id;

CREATE TABLE test_table_merge as test_table ENGINE = Merge(currentDatabase(), 'test_table');

INSERT INTO test_table (Id, Foo) values (1, 1);

SELECT any(t2.Foo) FROM test_table_merge AS t1 GLOBAL ANY LEFT JOIN test_table_merge AS t2 ON t1.Id = t2.Id FORMAT JSONEachRow
```

**Expected behavior**
