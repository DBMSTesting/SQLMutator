Title: WITH statement can be missed in distributed query processing
Description:
**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
latest master/arcadia
* Non-default settings, if any
```sql
SET prefer_localhost_replica=0
```
(Without it a local stream is created instead of a remote one. The query works fine with the local stream)
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
```sql
create table "t0" (a Int64, b Int64) engine = MergeTree() partition by a order by a;
create table "dist_t0" (a Int64, b Int64) engine = Distributed(test_shard_localhost, default, t0);
```
* Sample data for all these tables
```sql
insert into t0 values (0, 0);
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result

```sql
di.man.yp-c.yandex.net :) with b as (select toInt64(number) as a from numbers(10)), c as (select toInt64(number) as a from numbers(10)) select * from "dist_t0" as a left join b as b on a.a = b.a left join c as c on a.a = c.a

WITH
    b AS 
    (
        SELECT toInt64(number) AS a
        FROM numbers(10)
    ),
    c AS 
    (
        SELECT toInt64(number) AS a
        FROM numbers(10)
    )
SELECT *
FROM dist_t0 AS a
LEFT JOIN b AS b ON a.a = b.a
LEFT JOIN c AS c ON a.a = c.a
