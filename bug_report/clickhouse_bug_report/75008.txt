When multiple array joins are passed inside a subquery, results of 2nd array join is not working as expected. Row values are still returned as an array, whereas it should have been returned as single value.

### How to reproduce

ClickHouse version - latest

https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/4f1f64b7-1105-4d89-bb99-800c056b8f97


```
CREATE TABLE test_table(
    id integer,
    array_a Nested(
        a1 String,
        a2 String
    ),
    array_b Nested(
        b1 String,
        b2 String
    )
)
ENGINE=MergeTree()
ORDER BY id;

INSERT INTO test_table (id, array_a.a1, array_a.a2, array_b.b1, array_b.b2) VALUES ('1', ['r1a1'], ['r1a2'], ['r1b1'], ['r1b2']);

-- sample query with multiple array joins
SELECT array_b.b1
FROM
(
    SELECT *
    FROM test_table
    ARRAY JOIN array_a
)
ARRAY JOIN array_b;

-- query with multiple array joins passed inside subquery which returns wrong result
SELECT (
        SELECT array_b.b1
        FROM
        (
            SELECT *
            FROM test_table
            ARRAY JOIN array_a
        )
        ARRAY JOIN array_b
    ) AS rows;
```

### Expected behavior

Results of multiple array join inside subquery is returning singular value in CH version <= 24.9.3
