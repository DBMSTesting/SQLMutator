Title: CASE expression result is NULL when a match occurs
Description:
**Describe the unexpected behaviour**

```sql
select case 1 when 1 then 'foo' else null end;
select case 1 when 1 then 'foo' end;
```

Both expressions return `null`.

**Expected behavior**

I would expect the result to be `'foo'` in both cases since `1 = 1`.
