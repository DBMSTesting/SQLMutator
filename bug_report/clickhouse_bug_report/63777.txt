Title: Improving SQL DEFINERS for MV
Description:
Currently if you have a the following tables:

```
DROP TABLE events_mv;
DROP TABLE materialized_events;
DROP TABLE session_events;

CREATE TABLE session_events(
    clientId UUID,
    sessionId UUID,
    pageId UUID,
    timestamp DateTime,
    type String
) ORDER BY (timestamp);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW events_mv
TO materialized_events
AS SELECT
    clientId,
    sessionId,
    pageId,
    timestamp,
    type
FROM session_events;

CREATE TABLE materialized_events(
    clientId UUID,
    sessionId UUID,
    pageId UUID,
    timestamp DateTime,
    type String
) ORDER BY (timestamp);
```

The minimum set of permission you currently need for a user to insert into the table:

```
DROP USER user_1;
CREATE USER user_1 IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'My_password123@';
GRANT INSERT ON default.session_events TO user_1;
GRANT SELECT ON default.session_events TO user_1;
```

If you don't specify 

`GRANT SELECT ON default.session_events TO user_1;`

The insert will fail because of missing permission. 

The permission should be covered by the definer. Ideally the only grant that should be needed would be:

`GRANT INSERT ON default.session_events TO user_1;`
