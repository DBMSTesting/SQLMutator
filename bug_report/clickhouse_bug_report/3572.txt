Title: Clickhouse compatibility issues after update
Description:
Hello,

After I updated Clickhouse to master (so far I used a version which is at least 4 month older than master) I discovered that median and quantile for a DateTime field is not longer returning a DateTime result as all other aggregation functions. Instead returns a timestamp.

```
CREATE TABLE test(a Nullable(DateTime)) ENGINE = Memory;
INSERT INTO test(a) VALUES(toDateTime('2016-06-15 23:00:00'));
SELECT min(a), max(a), median(a), quantile(0.2)(a) from test;
```
On the master returns:

`2016-06-15 23:00:00	2016-06-15 23:00:00	1466031600	1466031600`

On a older ClickHouse version returns all values as DateTime

Is this a regression bug or expected behaviour?

Silviu
