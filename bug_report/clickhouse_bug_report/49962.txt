Title: Deadlock on ReplicatedMergeTree startup
Description:
HI! I have met with problem after updating to any version later than 22.9
now i have 22.8.16 version. It is the latest version witch don't have any problem with start
Today I tried to upgrade to 23.4
when the server tries to start after the update, it stops at the initialization of a table and does not continue further

```
but in error log there is no any errors that connected with it
strace shows that it is waiting for something (but this strace example is not from the last try, I have checked that the behavior is always the same)
```
strace -p 1182283
strace: Process 1182283 attached
futex(0x7ffe070b7ea0, FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE, 0, NULL
```

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

yes, i've reproduce it on every version later than 22.9

**How to reproduce**
I don't know how exactly to reproduce this problem. I indicated above how it happens to me

**Expected behavior**

normal starting after upgrade

**Additional context**

if it helps, i can try to collect a full trace log after launch. Or maybe you know how i can update my servers
if it matters i have a cluster of 6 servers with 3 shards
