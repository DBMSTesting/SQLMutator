Title: Settings, lowercasing, locale
Description:
User reported connectivity issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/DBE-9900

Seems to be SESSION_ID lowercased using system (Turkish) locale, causing wrong letters (`ı`, not `i`)

Seems to be server issue, as `... this wasn't an issue in previous ClickHouse versions(like v19.15 or something)`
