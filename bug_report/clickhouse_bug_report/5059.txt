Title: force_index_by_date can't work with primary key 'toDate(toDateTime(dt / 1000))'
Description:
**Describe the bug**
force_index_by_date can't work with toDate(toDateTime(dt / 1000))

**How to reproduce**
the unit of our timestamp is 'millisecond', not 'second', so, when we convert it to datetime, we should
/1000 at first, but this let force_index_by_date can't work.

we opened conf 'force_index_by_date', my MergeTree table set 'PARTITION BY toDate(toDateTime(dt / 1000))', but the query
SELECT count() FROM table1 
WHERE toDate(toDateTime(dt / 1000)) = '2019-04-18'
=> DB::Exception: MinMax index by columns (dt) is not used and setting 'force_index_by_date' is set

but

SELECT count()
FROM ks_app_analytics_dev.mwprod_overview_hourly_analysis_realtime_local 
WHERE toDateTime(dt) = '2019-04-19 00:00:00'
can work, although wrong result, no exception

may be this is a bug, CH version: 18.14.13
