Description:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT time_column
      FROM mytable
    )
           CROSS JOIN (
          SELECT count()
          FROM mytable
          WHERE time_column IS NULL
          )
```

The joint result:

How it is possible there are nulls but count() says there are none? I can see nulls when selecting from table so I guess the count() is wrong ðŸ¤”
