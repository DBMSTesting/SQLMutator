Title: SSIS incompatible with Clickhouse ODBC
Description:
Hi All

I am working in one of the biggest companies in the middle east and we are using clickhouse.
I want to build my ETL's with SSIS but I can't use clickhouse ODBC as a data-flow source.
I even get a preview of data but [data flow\odbc source] is unable to detect columns.
we used it in powerbi without any issues

visual studio 2019 
ssis: 3.1
clickhouse ODBC: 1.00.00.5435
clickhouse : 19.8.3.8

**Expected behavior**
it would be great if I can read data from clickhouse and insert it to an excel file using SSIS.
