Title: "Hardware Benchmark" web page is unusable
Description:
https://clickhouse.tech/benchmark/hardware/
The bug was introduced in #10412
It is literally catastrophic, because I cannot use this page anymore,
it is so ugly that I have no motivation to share the link, to use it in my presentations, etc...

I have restored the old web page here:
https://presentations.clickhouse.tech/original_website/benchmark_hardware.html

Here will be the list of items on what's wrong with the current web page.
