Title: Nobody can use the data from ClickHouse's Prometheus exporter... because of a simple invalid escape sequence \' ðŸ˜­
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Hi thanks for the lib! However, nobody can use the data from ClickHouse's Prometheus exporter... because of a simple invalid escape sequence `\'` :(

More details:

The `/metrics` endpoint does provide Prometheus-compatible data. However, some lines look like the following:

```
...
# HELP ClickHouseProfileEvents_Seek Number of times the \'lseek\' function was called.
...
```

Notice the `\'`. According to the official Prometheus format parser, this is ***invalid***. Thus, the data are rejected by Prometheus or similar services like MetricBeat in Elastic Stack.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Yes!

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use 20.12.4.5
* Which interface to use, if matters N/A
* Non-default settings, if any: open the Prometheus metrics
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved N/A
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary N/A
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result: N/S

**Expected behavior**
Should not have `\'`

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
N/A

**Additional context**
N/A
