Title: rows_before_limit_at_least is missing from the HTTP interface after upgrade to 2.3.3.6
Description:
After upgrade to 2.3.3.6, when running a query from the HTTP interface, the parameter **rows_before_limit_at_least** is missing. It is returned for the same query when using the cli.

**How to reproduce**
* Upgrade/Install clickhouse server version 2.3.3.6
* Run a query using the HTTP interface.
* The parameter **rows_before_limit_at_least** is missing.

It worked fine when I downgraded to 2.1
