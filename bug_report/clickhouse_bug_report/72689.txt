* Which ClickHouse server version to use: latest
* Which interface to use, if it matters: any
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to an unexpected result

**Expected behavior**

Should output the result using the defaut format unless you ask it to output it as a graph.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

It cause problem as currently the clickhouse connect python driver dont like the fact there is a "rect" in the result set :
