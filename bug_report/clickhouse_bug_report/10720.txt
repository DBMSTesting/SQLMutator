Title: RENAME TABLE is not atomic for ReplicatedMergeTree
Description:
Did a rename on a table which was readonly (after zookeeper data lost), folder was renamed, after that i get an exception. 

Also - can't drop such the table.

Also can't detach & forget (FR https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/5555 )

Only manual intervention on filesystem helped.
