Title: Can't create column with name `index` in 19.3.3
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Parsing of query `CREATE TABLE` failing when there is an `index` column

**How to reproduce**
* Clean and zero-config docker setup from image `yandex/clickHouse-server:19.3.3`

```
CREATE `some` (date Date, index UInt16) ENGINE = Memory()
```
Or 
```
CREATE `some` (date Date, index UInt16)
        ENGINE = MergeTree()
        ORDER BY (date)
        PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date)
```

**Expected behavior**
Table should be created

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
```
Received exception from server (version 19.3.3):
Code: 62. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: Syntax error: failed at position 59 (line 1, col 59): )

```

**Additional context**
I've found workarround 
```sql
CREATE TABLE `some` (date Date, `index` UInt16) ENGINE = Memory()
```
but this issue still looks like a breaking change
