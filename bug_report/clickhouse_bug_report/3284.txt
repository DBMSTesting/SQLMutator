Title: Unsupported type Nullable(Date) when trying to load range_hash MySQL dictionary
Description:
Upgraded to 8.12, and my external `range_hash` dictionary that loads data from MYSQL stopped working. 
Error message is: `Unsupported type Nullable(Date)`. 

Downgraded to 8.6 and it works fine. Because did not have time to dig further could not try any other versions, just semi-randomly selected 18.6 after going over some change logs.
