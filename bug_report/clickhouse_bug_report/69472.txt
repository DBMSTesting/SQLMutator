Title: Analyzer: Predicate pushdown doesn't work with distributed tables

### Question

Hi,

I have question regarding predicate pushdown optimisation.

CH version : 24.3.3.102

example table
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.entity_local (
   tenant_id          UInt64,
   entity_id              UInt64,
   entity_name            String,
   modified_at         DateTime
)
ENGINE = ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(modified_at)
ORDER BY (tenant_id, entity_id)
TTL modified_at + INTERVAL 5 YEAR
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192, ttl_only_drop_parts=1;`

with distributed table default.entity

query 
`SELECT
    COUNT(entity_id)
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM default.entity
)
WHERE tenant_id = 2`

executes for 5 seconds ( given there are 100M records within distributed table )
if EXPLAIN SYNTAX is executed returned is 
`SELECT
    COUNT(entity_id)
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM default.entity
    WHERE tenant_id = 2
)
WHERE tenant_id = 2`

If this query is manually executed, results are returned within few ms.

What is the reason that CH doesnt push down predicates when executing query although EXPLAIN SYNTAX suggest so?
