Title: Mutation doesn't work for ReplacingMergeTree
Description:
I have table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE test_mumtation (id String, created DateTime, value String) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(created) ORDER BY (id)


INSERT INTO test_mumtation VALUES('abc123', '2020-02-01 12:45:04', '1'), ('edf456', '2020-03-18 09:07:56', '2'), ('htk789', '2020-04-10 13:30:00', '2')
```
I tried update data:
```sql
 ALTER TABLE test_mumtation UPDATE value = '3' WHERE id='htk789'
```

but I got OK and data wasn't updated.

Command:
```sql
SELECT * FROM system.mutations
```
show what nothing happend:
```sql
database:                   default
table:                      test_mumtation
mutation_id:                mutation_12.txt
command:                    UPDATE value = '3' WHERE id = 'htk789'
create_time:                2020-04-10 17:56:23

parts_to_do:                3
is_done:                    0
latest_failed_part:         
latest_fail_time:           0000-00-00 00:00:00
latest_fail_reason:         


```

I haven't merges queue or errors into clickhouse.log. And if I add SETTINGS mutations_sync = 1 then query doesn't return OK and will canceled by timeout.
