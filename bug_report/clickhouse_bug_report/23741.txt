Title: output_format_json_array_of_rows server setting ignored
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Similar to #3489, the `output_format_json_array_of_rows` setting is ignored when set in `users.xml` settings. When set in config.xml, the server doesn't even start.
Setting through `clickhouse-client` works as expected.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Yes, as described below.

**How to reproduce**
* ClickHouse server version 21.4.5 revision 54447 from docker image `yandex/clickhouse-server:21 (1c73a207247b)`
* HTTP interface as well as command line `ClickHouse client version 21.4.5.46 (official build)`
* Non-default settings:

additional `config.xml`:
```xml
<yandex>                                                
    <logger>                                            
        <level>none</level>                             
    </logger>                                           
                                                        
    <max_concurrent_queries>300</max_concurrent_queries>
                             
    <keep_alive_timeout>3600</keep_alive_timeout>       
</yandex>                                               
```
additional `users.xml`:
```xml
<yandex>                                                                          
    <profiles>                                                                    
        <default>                                                             
            <output_format_json_array_of_rows>1</output_format_json_array_of_rows>
        </default>                                                                
    </profiles>                                                                   
</yandex>                                                                         
```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
FORMAT JSONEachRow
```

**Expected behavior**
Would expect to get back a JSON array containing each result row as an object, as described in [documentation]:
```
[
  {...},
  {...},
  {...}
]
```
Instead, Clickhouse returns NDJSON:
```
{...}
{...}
{...}
```
