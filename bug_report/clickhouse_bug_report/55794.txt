Title: Exception using WITH FILL INTERPOLATE
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

When I run the below query, I get an exception:

Query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS example_table (
  ColumnA Int64,
  ColumnB Int64,
  ColumnC Int64
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY ColumnA;

WITH
helper AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    example_table
  ORDER BY
    ColumnA WITH FILL INTERPOLATE (
      ColumnB AS ColumnC,
      ColumnC AS ColumnA
    )
)
SELECT ColumnB FROM helper
```

Reproduce: [https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/a739468f-439c-4c8f-9d55-2d2f214fde88](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/a739468f-439c-4c8f-9d55-2d2f214fde88)

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes, I can reproduce this on 23.9.1.1854.

**Expected behavior**

I would expect the same (empty) output as if I include all columns in the final SELECT:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS example_table;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS example_table (
  ColumnA Int64,
  ColumnB Int64,
  ColumnC Int64
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY ColumnA;

WITH
helper AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    example_table
  ORDER BY
    ColumnA WITH FILL INTERPOLATE (
      ColumnB AS ColumnC,
      ColumnC AS ColumnA
    )
)
SELECT * FROM helper
```

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

I get the following exception:

```
Received exception from server (version 23.9.1):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown column: ColumnA, there are only columns ColumnB, ColumnC. (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER)
(query: WITH
helper AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    example_table
  ORDER BY
    ColumnA WITH FILL INTERPOLATE (
      ColumnB AS ColumnC,
      ColumnC AS ColumnA
    )
)
SELECT ColumnB FROM helper)

```
