**Describe what's wrong**

> query MV distributed table failed on v22.3.2.2 but success on 21.8.14.5

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
  - v22.3.2.2
* my cluster setting as:
```
<remote_servers>
    <df_cluster>
	<shard>
	     <replica>
		  <host>10.1.20.22</host>
		  <port>9000</port>
	     </replica>
	</shard>
	<shard>
	     <replica>
		  <host>10.1.20.23</host>
		  <port>9000</port>
	     </replica>
	</shard>
    </df_cluster>
</remote_servers>
```
* create tables on both 10.1.20.22 and 10.1.20.23 as follow sqls;
```
// create src table  
clickhouse-client -q "create database test;"
clickhouse-client -q "CREATE TABLE test.src (time DateTime(), tag UInt64, v UInt64) ENGINE = MergeTree PRIMARY KEY (time)  ORDER BY time ;"

// create mv tables  dst_agg, dst_local, dst_mv
clickhouse-client -q "CREATE TABLE test.dst_agg (time DateTime(), tag UInt64, v_agg AggregateFunction(sum, UInt64)) ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree PRIMARY KEY (time, tag)  ORDER BY (time,tag) ;"
clickhouse-client -q "CREATE VIEW test.dst_local  (time DateTime(), tag UInt64, v UInt64) AS SELECT time, tag, sumMerge(v_agg) AS v FROM test.dst_agg GROUP BY (time,tag);"
clickhouse-client -q "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW test.dst_mv TO test.dst_agg (time DateTime(), tag UInt64, v UInt64) AS SELECT toStartOfDay(time) AS time, tag, sumState(v) AS v_agg FROM test.src GROUP BY time,tag ORDER BY time,tag;"

// create Distributed table test.dst  on cluster `df_cluster`
clickhouse-client -q "CREATE TABLE test.dst as test.dst_local ENGINE = Distributed('df_cluster', 'test', 'dst_local');"

// add data
clickhouse-client -q "insert into test.src (time, tag, v) values (now(), 1, 2) ;"
```
* error message when query 
```
// query failed on 10.1.20.22
[root@22 ~]# clickhouse-client -q "select v from test.dst;"
Received exception from server (version 22.3.2):
Code: 215. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Received from 10.1.20.23:9000. DB::Exception: Column `time` is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY: While processing time, tag, sumMerge(v_agg). 

// query failed on 10.1.20.23
[root@23 ~]# clickhouse-client -q "select tag from test.dst;"
Received exception from server (version 22.3.2):
Code: 215. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Received from 10.1.20.22:9000. DB::Exception: Column `time` is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY: While processing time, tag, sumMerge(v_agg).
```

expect query success.
