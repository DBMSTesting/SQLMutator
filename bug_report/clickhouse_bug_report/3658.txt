Title: DISTINCT with JOIN returns duplicates (18.14.15)
Description:
Hi,

sometimes, the following query leaves duplicates in the result (number of result rows differ on repeated queries):

`select  distinct ds.id 
from test.facts f all join test.dim_service ds 
on f.dim_service_id=ds.id `

**facts** is a MergeTree-table, **dim_service** an external dictionary.

Additional **group by** works:

`select  distinct ds.id from test.facts f all join test.dim_service ds on f.dim_service_id=ds.id group by ds.id`

Cheers!
