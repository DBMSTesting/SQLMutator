Title: Table alias and MATERIALIZED column - no column error
Description:
There is an error during query with where by materialized column;


**How to reproduce**
1. Install clean 19.17.5
2. create table
```sql
create table logs(
    date_visited DateTime,
    date Date MATERIALIZED toDate(date_visited)
) ENGINE MergeTree()
order by tuple()
```
3. 
```sql
select count() from logs as plogs where plogs.date = '2019-11-20'
```
4. get an error:

```sql
select count() from logs as plogs where plogs.date_visited = '2019-11-20 00:00:00'
```
```
