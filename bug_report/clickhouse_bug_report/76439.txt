Title: Bug in iceberg path processing
Description:
### Describe what's wrong

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM iceberg('s3://support-iceberg-repro/repro', <login>, <password>)

Query id: ac50fbba-fffd-4620-8e53-f3054e1b45fd

Elapsed: 0.143 sec.

Received exception from server (version 25.1.1):
Code: 499. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Failed to get object info: No response body.. HTTP response code: 404: while reading repro/repro/data/NEpJIA/20250212_122424_00022_8vmvn-65507c87-ebe4-405d-8d19-d3e0fab71552.parquet: While executing IcebergS3(_table_function.iceberg)Source. (S3_ERROR)
```

Bug in Iceberg that is connected with the fact that we take a path written in Iceberg metadata, find first inclusion of the (table_name + '/') and say that the part after this inclusion is a part inside table. This is not true in above example because the first match is:

s3://support-iceberg- **repro/** repro/


### Does it reproduce on the most recent release?

Yes

### How to reproduce

Create an iceberg table which name is a subsuffix of a bucket name
