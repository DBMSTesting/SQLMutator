Title: SAMPLE BY isn't working on an int column without HASH function (+ another interesting note)
Description:
Hi all,

A small brief:
I'm trying to achieve real time funnel calculation using the `windowFunnel` function (not related to the issue).
My data I'm testing on is:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE funnels (
	EventTime DateTime,
	UserId UInt64, 
	Step UInt8 
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
--ORDER BY (intHash32(UserId), EventTime)
ORDER BY (UserId, EventTime)
PARTITION BY (EventTime)
--SAMPLE BY intHash32(UserId)
SAMPLE BY UserId;

INSERT INTO funnels SELECT 24*60*60*0, number, 1 from system.numbers LIMIT 100000000;
INSERT INTO funnels SELECT 24*60*60*1, number, 2 from system.numbers LIMIT 10000000;
INSERT INTO funnels SELECT 24*60*60*2, number, 3 from system.numbers LIMIT 1000000;
```

Client flag `optimize_aggregation_in_order=1`

**Some notes I've noticed:**
1. Inserting into this table when using the intHash32 on the table, is MUCH slower (39s vs 6s without it)
2. intHash32 isn't a uniform hash (we don't want to use it anyways since the UserId is already a unique int)
3. The interesting part: 
Query:
```
SELECT level, count() AS c FROM ( 
    SELECT UserId, windowFunnel(25920000)(EventTime, Step = 1, Step = 2, Step = 3) AS level 
    FROM funnels 
    SAMPLE 1/10000 
    GROUP BY UserId 
) as a 
GROUP BY level 
ORDER BY level ASC
```

The SAMPLE BY part is working only when the table is created with intHash32 on the `ORDER BY` and the `SAMLE` parts.
It isn't working (completely ignored) when I don't use it, or even when I insert using intHash32 (still the table is defined without it).

### So my questions are:
1. Why? 
2. How can I make it work without paying so much on insertion time?
3. Is it a bug?

Thanks.
