Title: Unknown identifier in aggregate function error when using same alias in different levels of query
Description:
When same alias names are used in different levels of query in some cases "unknown identifier" errors are received.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Yes, reproduces on all builds 21.3, 21.8, latest 21.9 too. 

**How to reproduce**

```
chserver :) SELECT
:-]     sum(q0.a2) AS a1,
:-]     sum(q0.a1) AS a9
:-] FROM
:-] (
:-]     SELECT
:-]         1 AS a1,
:-]         2 AS a2
:-] ) AS q0
:-] ;

SELECT
    sum(q0.a2) AS a1,
    sum(q0.a1) AS a9
FROM
(
    SELECT
        1 AS a1,
        2 AS a2
) AS q0

Query id: cd2ff574-fcb3-4027-8fee-7a105bccde53


Received exception from server (version 21.8.5):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from chserver:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown identifier 'a1' in aggregate function 'sum(a1) AS a9'.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.121 sec.

chserver :) SELECT
:-]     (q0.a2) AS a1,
:-]     (q0.a1) AS a9
:-] FROM
:-] (
:-]     SELECT
:-]         1 AS a1,
:-]         2 AS a2
:-] ) AS q0
:-] ;

SELECT
    q0.a2 AS a1,
    q0.a1 AS a9
FROM
(
    SELECT
        1 AS a1,
        2 AS a2
) AS q0

Query id: ec6a030a-d8e2-4ad1-b7de-35bb74831ba6

┌─a1─┬─a9─┐
│  2 │  1 │
└────┴────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.121 sec.

chserver :)
```

**Expected behavior**
It should work disregarding of order of columns in query.
