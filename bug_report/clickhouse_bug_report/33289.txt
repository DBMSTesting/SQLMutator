Title: Settings limit/offset dose not work as expected on View
Description:
Given that vcounter is a View, the settings limit/offset dose not work as expected.

```sql
CREATE TABLE counter (id UInt64, createdAt DateTime) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY id;
INSERT INTO counter SELECT number, now() FROM numbers(500);

CREATE VIEW vcounter AS
SELECT
    intDiv(id, 10) AS tens,
    max(createdAt) AS maxid
FROM counter
GROUP BY tens;

SELECT *
FROM vcounter
ORDER BY tens ASC
LIMIT 100
SETTINGS limit = 6, offset = 5


┌─tens─┬───────────────maxid─┐
│   47 │ 2021-12-29 13:05:23 │
└──────┴─────────────────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec.

```

The query should return 6 rows, instead of one. 

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes, we can reproduce it on `21.10`.

**Expected behavior**

The query should return 6 rows, instead of one.

**Additional context**

Replace view with subquery works though,

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT
        intDiv(id, 10) AS tens,
        max(createdAt) AS maxid
    FROM test.counter
    GROUP BY tens
)
LIMIT 100
SETTINGS limit = 6, offset = 5;

┌─tens─┬───────────────maxid─┐
