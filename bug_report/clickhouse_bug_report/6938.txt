Title: Sometimes inserting bitmap fails silently
Description:
**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
Given a table, construct bitmaps for columns of it, and insert those bitmaps into another table. 
The inserting succeed for some columns, and fails silently for other columns.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
v19.14.3.3-stable
* Which interface to use, if matters
CLI
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
```
DROP TABLE cdp_tags;
CREATE TABLE cdp_tags (
    tag_id String,
    mid_seqs AggregateFunction(groupBitmap, UInt32),
    cardinality UInt32
) engine=ReplacingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (tag_id) SETTINGS index_granularity=1;

```
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
```
-- ok
INSERT INTO cdp_tags SELECT concat('is_member_', toString(is_member)) AS tag_id, groupBitmapState(mid_seq) AS mid_seqs, bitmapCardinality(mid_seqs) AS cardinality FROM dist_cdp_cust_tag GROUP BY is_member;

-- ok
INSERT INTO cdp_tags SELECT concat('member_origin_channel_', toString(member_origin_channel)) AS tag_id, groupBitmapState(mid_seq) AS mid_seqs, bitmapCardinality(mid_seqs) AS cardinality FROM dist_cdp_cust_tag GROUP BY member_origin_channel;

-- ok
SELECT tag_id, bitmapCardinality(mid_seqs), cardinality FROM cdp_tags WHERE like(tag_id, 'is_member_%') ORDER BY cardinality DESC;
-- show 0 rows without any error
SELECT tag_id, bitmapCardinality(mid_seqs), cardinality FROM cdp_tags WHERE like(tag_id, 'member_origin_channel_%') ORDER BY cardinality DESC;

```

I also noticed that inserting constant bitmap always succeed. For example,
```
INSERT INTO cdp_tags SELECT concat('member_origin_channel_', toString(member_origin_channel)) AS tag_id, bitmapBuild(cast([3,19,47] as Array(UInt32))) AS mid_seqs, bitmapCardinality(mid_seqs) AS cardinality FROM dist_cdp_cust_tag GROUP BY member_origin_channel;

-- show 1 row without any error
SELECT tag_id, bitmapCardinality(mid_seqs), cardinality FROM cdp_tags WHERE like(tag_id, 'member_origin_channel_%') ORDER BY cardinality DESC;

```

**Expected behavior**
Insertion shall succeed for any bitmap.

**Additional context**
I iterated 19.14 tags to check which one becomes bad. Here's the result:
