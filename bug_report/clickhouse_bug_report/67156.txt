SELECT 'FOURTH';

DATA
   +-----------+-----------+----+
   |        c0 |        c1 | c2 |
   +-----------+-----------+----+
1. | 826636805 |         0 |    |
   +-----------+-----------+----+
2. |         0 | 150808457 |    |
   +-----------+-----------+----+
NUMBER OF ROWS IN FIRST SHOULD BE EQUAL TO SECOND
FISRT
SECOND
1
TO DEBUG I TOOK JUST A SUBQUERY AND IT HAS 1 ROW
THIRD
1
AND I ADDED SINGLE CONDITION THAT CONDITION <>0 THAT IS 1 IN THIRD QUERY AND IT HAS NO RESULT!!!
FOURTH
```

Basically adding condition `WHERE check <> 0;` of a column that is equal to 1 in result we get no output for query
