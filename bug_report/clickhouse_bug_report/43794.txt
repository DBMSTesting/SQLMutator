Title: Wrong behaviour of LEFT join when using ON 1 = 1 clause
Description:

**Describe what's wrong**

When using a LEFT JOIN with an ON clause with 1 = 1 (or anything that is always true), I expect to see result from the left table regardless of the number of rows in the right table.


**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

It reproduces on 22.9.5.25.



**How to reproduce**

```

WITH 
	empty_query AS  ( select 'b' as b where FALSE ),  -- Right result is empty
	query AS ( select 'a' as a ) -- Left result is not empty

SELECT * from query

LEFT JOIN empty_query on 1 = 1
```

**Expected behavior**

```
a|b|
-+-+
a| <NULL> |
```


**Actual behavior**

```
a|b|
-+-+
```
(Empty result)
