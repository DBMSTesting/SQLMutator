Title: Log engine in disdributed and replicated cluster
Description:
The distributed and replicated cluster was built, 
`<shard>`
            `<internal_replication>false</internal_replication>`
            `<replica>`
                `<host>host1</host>`
               ` <port>9002</port>`
              `<user>default</user>`
               ` <password>***</password>`
            `</replica>`
	   `<replica>`
                `<host>host2</host>`
               ` <port>9002</port>`
               ` <user>default</user>`
                `<password>***</password>`
            `</replica>`
  `</shard>`
 it can work well when i build local table on every node with engine=ReplicateMergeTree and build distributed table with engine=Distributed. But, if i build local tableA with engine=Log on host1, and insert data into tableA, and Exception is throwed like host2 does not exist tableA.
Log is not replicated engine,  but it try to insert data at another replicated node.
