query sql is:
SELECT
	salesEmployeeType,
	sum(toInt16OrZero(sku_qty)) AS qty
FROM
(
	SELECT
		sales_employee_type AS salesEmployeeType,
		sku_qty AS sku_qty
	FROM
	(
		SELECT
			art_sku_sale_history.id AS id,
			art_sku_sale_history.rksj AS rksj,
			art_sku_sale_history.enabled AS enabled,
			art_sku_sale_history.sku_qty AS sku_qty,
			scd_shop_principal.employee_type AS sales_employee_type	
		FROM
			shared_ods.art_sku_sale_history 
			ASOF LEFT JOIN shared_dwd.scd_shop_principal 
			ON art_sku_sale_history.tenant_code = scd_shop_principal.tenant_code AND art_sku_sale_history.sale_date > scd_shop_principal.principal_datetime 
	)
	WHERE
		enabled = '1'
		AND (id, rksj) IN ( SELECT id, max(rksj) FROM shared_ods.art_sku_sale_history GROUP BY id )
