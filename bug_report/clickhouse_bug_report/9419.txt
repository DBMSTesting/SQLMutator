Title: Return result after query canceled
Description:
Don't know is it a bug, but working really strange.

CH: `20.1.2.4 (official build)`

```
:) select now(), sum(parts_to_do) from system.mutations;

SELECT 
    now(), 
    sum(parts_to_do)
FROM system.mutations

Timeout exceeded while receiving data from server. Waited for 300 seconds, timeout is 300 seconds.
