Title: CTE in a materialized view condition wrongly parsed
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

When creating a materialized view using a CTE as a condition, it gets parsed as a regular table.

In:

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_cte_bug.mv TO mv_cte_bug.ds
(
    `timestamp` DateTime,
    `payload` String
) AS
WITH [''] AS problematic_cte
SELECT
    timestamp,
    payload
FROM mv_cte_bug.landing
WHERE payload IN problematic_cte
```

The `WHERE payload IN problematic_cte` gets transformed into `WHERE payload IN (default.problematic_cte)` causing all inserts to fail.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Failing in 23.8 and 22.8

**How to reproduce**

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mv_cte_bug ON CLUSTER tinybird SYNC;
CREATE DATABASE mv_cte_bug ON CLUSTER tinybird;

CREATE TABLE mv_cte_bug.landing ON CLUSTER tinybird (
    `timestamp` DateTime,
    `payload` String
)
Engine=ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{layer}-{shard}/mv_cte_bug.landing', '{replica}')
ORDER BY timestamp;

CREATE TABLE mv_cte_bug.ds ON CLUSTER tinybird (
    `timestamp` DateTime,
    `payload` String
)
Engine=ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{layer}-{shard}/mv_cte_bug.ds', '{replica}')
ORDER BY timestamp;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_cte_bug.mv ON CLUSTER tinybird TO mv_cte_bug.ds AS
WITH [''] AS problematic_cte
SELECT timestamp, payload
FROM mv_cte_bug.landing
WHERE payload IN problematic_cte
;

SHOW CREATE TABLE mv_cte_bug.mv;
```

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_cte_bug.mv TO mv_cte_bug.ds
(
    `timestamp` DateTime,
    `payload` String
) AS
WITH [''] AS problematic_cte
SELECT
    timestamp,
    payload
FROM mv_cte_bug.landing
WHERE payload IN (default.problematic_cte)
```

**Expected behavior**

The MV gets created correctly.
