Title: Using compression=true on JDBC fails on FreeBSD
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug or unexpected behaviour**
Using compression=false works fine, setting compression=true results in an error:
`ClickHouse response without column names .`
**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
19.11.5.28
* Which interface to use, if matters
JDBC

**Expected behavior**
Connection just works

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
Output from `/var/log/clickhouse/clickhouse-server.err.log`:

`2019.12.09 16:27:59.522159 [ 277 ] {ea205269-440c-43b1-8984-94d6f55c44f6} <Error> virtual DB::WriteBufferFromHTTPServerResponse::~WriteBufferFromHTTPServerResponse(): Poco::Exception.

**Additional context**
`FreeBSD <hostname> 12.1-RELEASE-p1 FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE-p1 GENERIC  amd64`

It seems that there is an issue to fix this but reporting bug anyway: [poco](https://github.com/pocoproject/poco/pull/1574)
