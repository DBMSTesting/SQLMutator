Title: Got "Unknown identifier" while quering
Description:
**Describe the bug**
Hello，recently I met a bug while using clickhouse to do some queries with tableau server，which is weird and I can not find any solutions after searching the internet.

**How to reproduce**
Here are the steps to reproduce the bug.

1. ClickHouse Server version : 21.1.2.15

2. Table DDL
`CREATE TABLE test
(
    id String,
    create_time DateTime
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id
`
3. insert some values into the table
`insert into test values(1,'1970-02-01 00:00:00');`
`insert into test values(2,'1970-02-01 00:00:00');`
4. the query sql
`select id,'1997-02-01' as create_time from test where test.create_time='1970-02-01 00:00:00'`
once you run the sql，you'll get an exception which is said "_Unkown identifier create_time there are columns : id: while processing create_time='1997-02-01 00:00:00'(version 21.1.2.15 (official build))_"
I also try these steps in mysql，however，there is no problem in it. So，I think it is a bug in clickhouse.

I know it's kind of strange that the column alias is the same as the column in the table，but  it is tableau's behaviour and I can hardly change it.
