Title: Query wrong result 18.14.8(9) (CH cashes ? subquery result)
Description:
Preparing:

CREATE TABLE dt(tkey Int32) ENGINE = MergeTree order by tuple();
insert into dt values (300000);
CREATE TABLE testx(t Int32, a UInt8) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY tuple();
INSERT INTO testx VALUES (100000, 0);
**select count(*) from testx  where not a and t < (select tkey from dt);** 
1
drop table dt;
CREATE TABLE dt(tkey Int32) ENGINE = MergeTree order by tuple();
insert into dt values (0);

BUG:
**select count(*) from dw.testx  where not a and t < (select tkey from dt);**
**1**
select tkey from dt
0
select count(*) from dw.testx  where not a and t < 0
0


So CH does not see that value in the table dt has changed from 300000 to 0.
