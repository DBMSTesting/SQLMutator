Title: External sort doesn't work in presence of `ARRAY JOIN`, `lambda` and `LIMIT BY`
Description:
```sql
SELECT
    number,
    v,
    arrayMap(x -> (x * x), range(number % 10)) AS arr
FROM numbers(5)
ARRAY JOIN arr AS v
ORDER BY number ASC
LIMIT 3 BY v
```

```
┌─number─┬─v─┬─arr───────┐
│      1 │ 0 │ [0]       │
│      2 │ 0 │ [0,1]     │
│      2 │ 1 │ [0,1]     │
│      3 │ 0 │ [0,1,4]   │
│      3 │ 1 │ [0,1,4]   │
│      3 │ 4 │ [0,1,4]   │
│      4 │ 1 │ [0,1,4,9] │
│      4 │ 4 │ [0,1,4,9] │
│      4 │ 9 │ [0,1,4,9] │
└────────┴───┴───────────┘

    v,
    arrayMap(x -> (x * x), range(number % 10)) AS arr
FROM numbers(5)
ARRAY JOIN arr AS v
ORDER BY number ASC
LIMIT 3 BY v
SETTINGS max_bytes_before_external_sort = 1
