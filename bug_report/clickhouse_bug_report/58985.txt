Title: `arrayZip(untuple(...))` doesn't work correctly on every Engine
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

As we needed something similar, we found the function `arrayZip(untuple(sumMap(number_keys, replicate(1, number_keys))))` in one issue question (https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/54534#issuecomment-1715389785).

When we tried out this function, it was failing with the error message:

```
Code: 42. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Function arrayZip needs at least one argument; passed 0.: While processing SELECT app, arrayZip(untuple(sumMap(k.keys, replicate(1, k.keys)))) FROM test WHERE c > 0 GROUP BY app. (NUMBER_OF_ARGUMENTS_DOESNT_MATCH)
```

Trying to replicate, it appears to be an issue related to the Engine (on Engine=MEMORY it works, on a ReplicatedMergeTree it doesn't) but also on whether a `WHERE` clause is being used??

This fiddle works (because Engine=MEMORY): https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/71fa06d1-dcc9-4fe2-a528-0876aa807a16

If we run the exact same locally, but a `ReplicatedMergeTree`:

```
c66cb0b011a9 :) CREATE TABLE test (app String, c UInt64, k Map(String, String)) ENGINE=ReplicatedMergeTree ORDER BY tuple();

CREATE TABLE test
(
    `app` String,
    `c` UInt64,
    `k` Map(String, String)
)
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree
ORDER BY tuple()

Received exception from server (version 23.11.2):

```

Funnily enough, if we remove the entire `WHERE` clause, it also works on the `ReplicatedMergeTree` (while the `WHERE` clause didn't actually limit the results to 0 or so):

```
c66cb0b011a9 :) select app, arrayZip(untuple(sumMap(mapKeys(k), replicate(1, mapKeys(k))))) from test group by app;

SELECT
    app,
    arrayZip(untuple(sumMap(mapKeys(k), replicate(1, mapKeys(k)))))
FROM test
GROUP BY app

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

At least on 23.11.2 as you can see in output above. 

**How to reproduce**

See the fiddle + commands above. Create the table on a (Replicated)MergeTree.

**Expected behavior**

`arrayZip(untuple(...))` to work as expected (which it mostly does)

**Error message and/or stacktrace**

```
Code: 42. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Function arrayZip needs at least one argument; passed 0.: While processing SELECT app, arrayZip(untuple(sumMap(k.keys, replicate(1, k.keys)))) FROM test WHERE c > 0 GROUP BY app. (NUMBER_OF_ARGUMENTS_DOESNT_MATCH)
```
