Title: Issue with using arrayEnumerate with Clickhouse version 20.9.2.20 
Description:
We encountered a problem while doing update from 20.5.3.27 to version 20.9.2.20 on Clickhouse.
We made materialized view:
Example with arrayEnumerate:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW case.view_mv_local
(
    `event_time` DateTime,
    `tenant_id` UInt32,
    `case_id` UInt8,
    `partner_id` UInt16
)
ENGINE = SummingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toStartOfDay(event_time)
ORDER BY (event_time,
 tenant_id,
 case_id,
 partner_id)
TTL event_time + toIntervalDay(7)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192 AS
SELECT 
    toStartOfHour(event_time) AS event_time,
    tenant_id,
    case_id,
    partner_ids[num] AS partner_id
FROM case.view_local
ARRAY JOIN arrayEnumerate(partner_ids) AS num
GROUP BY 
    event_time,
    tenant_id,
    case_id,
    partner_id;

After insert of data in Clickhouse we get this error:
err:  clickhouse: Code: 8, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Cannot find column session_id in source stream: while pushing to view case.view_mv_local (version 20.9.2.20 (official build))

We have column session_id in table case.view_local but it wasn't mentioned in MV. This worked well until we did update of Clickhouse on our system. We realised that we have problem with (ARRAY JOIN arrayEnumerate(partner_ids) AS num). When we dont use it on newest version on Clickhouse and just put [1] for arrays, everything starts to work fine. 

Example with [1]:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW case.view_mv_local
(
    `event_time` DateTime,
    `tenant_id` UInt32,
    `case_id` UInt8,
    `partner_id` UInt16
)
ENGINE = SummingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toStartOfDay(event_time)
ORDER BY (event_time,
 tenant_id,
 case_id,
 partner_id)
TTL event_time + toIntervalDay(7)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192 AS
SELECT 
    toStartOfHour(event_time) AS event_time,
    tenant_id,
    case_id,
    partner_ids[1] AS partner_id
FROM case.view_local
GROUP BY 
    event_time,
    tenant_id,
    case_id,
    partner_id;

source table:
CREATE TABLE case.view_local
(
    `session_id` FixedString(11) CODEC(ZSTD(1)),
    `tenant_id` UInt32 DEFAULT 0,
    `case_id` UInt8 DEFAULT 0,
    `partner_ids` Array(UInt16),
    `event_time` DateTime
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(event_time)
ORDER BY (tenant_id,
 event_time)
TTL event_time + toIntervalDay(60)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

Insert query:
INSERT INTO case.view_local
(session_id, tenant_id, case_id, partner_ids, event_time)
VALUES('SsO12":{fvc', 559041, 5512, [12,13,54,40], '2020-09-25 11:00:55');

Can you please tell me what could be the problem on Clickhouse in version 20.9.2.20 for arrayEnumerate?
