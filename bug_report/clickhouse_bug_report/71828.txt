Title: Analyzer: (Almost) constant expression can not be resolved from parent scope
Description:
ClickHouse v24.3+ (including latest lts v24.8 and latest in fiddle v24.10)

Exception:
```
with
    arrayMap(x -> x + 1, [0]) as a
select
    1
where
    1 in (select arrayJoin(a))
settings allow_experimental_analyzer = 1;

Received exception from server (version 24.10.1):
Code: 1. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Resolve identifier 'a' from parent scope only supported for constants and CTE. Actual arrayMap(x -> (x + 1), [0]) AS a node type FUNCTION. In scope (SELECT arrayJoin(a)). (UNSUPPORTED_METHOD)
```
In my mind this can't be a scope issue because this query works fine:
```
with
    [1] as a
select
    1
where
    1 in (select arrayJoin(a))
settings allow_experimental_analyzer = 1;
1
```
And `arrayMap(x -> x + 1, [0]) as a` is constant (known at the time the SQL query is parsed) and works fine with old analyzer:
```
with
    arrayMap(x -> x + 1, [0]) as a
select
    1
where
    1 in (select arrayJoin(a))
settings allow_experimental_analyzer = 0;
1
```
