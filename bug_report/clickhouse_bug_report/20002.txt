/entrypoint.sh: running /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
Code: 210. DB::NetException: Connection refused (localhost:9000)
~~~

If we run the same entrypoint script once the POD come up, it's able to create the databased and tables mentioned in init.sql

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**
Yes

**How to reproduce**
Try to start the clickhouse-server deployment in K8s env using custom init.sql. 

* Which ClickHouse server version to use


**Expected behavior**
It should be able to create the DBs and tables without any issue.
