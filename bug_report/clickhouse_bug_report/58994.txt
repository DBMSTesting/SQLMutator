SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 1,join_use_nulls=1

Received exception from server (version 24.1.1):
Code: 1. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Resolve identifier 'ws_order_number' from parent scope only supported for constants and CTE. Actual ws1.ws_order_number node type COLUMN. In scope (SELECT ws_order_number FROM ws_wh). (UNSUPPORTED_METHOD)

Works for SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 0,join_use_nulls=1 or SETTINGS allow_experimental_analyzer = 1,join_use_nulls=0
```

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes
