Title: Multiple sending data from a distributed table
Description:
Two shards without replication, version CH 20.4.5.36.

1. Create local Main_Tab tables
2. Create a Distributed table for Main_Tab tables - Distr_main_tab
3. Create a MaterializedView - MV and Tab - target tables that select and transform data from local tables Main_Tab  and insert their to Tab.
4. Insert data into Distr_main_tab
5. An error occurred while inserting into the target tables from MV.
6. In Distr_main_tab and Main_Tab, the data that should have been sent to the Main_Tab tables and then through MV in Tab is multiplied.

One gets the impression, as if, of a Distributed table, without receiving information that the data block was successfully transferred to the node - trying to send the same block many times, thereby multiplying the data.
