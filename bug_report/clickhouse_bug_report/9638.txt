```
ClickHouse client version 20.1.3.7.
Connecting to 127.0.0.1:9000 as user ymirlink.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 20.1.3 revision 54431.

dev-log :) CREATE TABLE t (interval Int32) ENGINE=MergeTree() ORDER BY tuple();

CREATE TABLE t
(
    `interval` Int32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY tuple()

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.228 sec.

dev-log :) SELECT "interval" FROM t;

SELECT interval
FROM t
