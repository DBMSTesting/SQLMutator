Title: HTTP interface: Server does not respond to health check/Cannot write to ostream

We had a lot of failures like this in functional tests with tsan and clang-14, but it was not clear what is the reason (but it's probably not related to tsan).
Now it happens with debug builds.

Dmitry Novik made a test that reproduces the issue with HTTP interface, but I don't remember details.

@novikd, could you please share the test?
