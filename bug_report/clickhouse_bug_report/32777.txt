Title: replaceRegexpAll has different behavior in 21 vs 20, and doesn't match the documentation
Description:
**Describe the unexpected behaviour**

I expect

```sql
select replaceRegexpAll('Hello, World!', '^', 'here: ')
```

to produce 

```
here: Hello, World!
```

in v20, this is the case, and in v21 the result is:

```
here: ello, World!
```

**How to reproduce**

Run the above query in clickhouse v20, then in v21
