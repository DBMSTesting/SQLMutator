Title: Kafka Engine: Dropping table and view leaves stable cgroup
Description:
Creating a case like the one shown in Kafka Engine doc page, dropping table and view leaves the consumer group "stable" in Kafka, so offsets cannot be reset.

```
DROP TABLE daily
DROP TABLE consumer
```
And then from a Kafka installation:
```
bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-server:port --group groupCHVisitors --reset-offsets  --topic visitors  --to-earliest
Error: Assignments can only be reset if the group 'groupCHVisitors' is inactive, but the current state is Stable.
TOPIC                          PARTITION  NEW-OFFSET 
```

Is this expected? Is there an option to do so? Otherwise, maybe when dropping the view, the consumer group should be left inactive, or an option could be provided to do so.
