Title: Query returns wrong result when reading constant from MergeTree with GROUP BY
Description:
### The problem is reproduced in 22.3.2.1

`CREATE TABLE test02( id Int,col1 String,col2 String,create_date Date ) ENGINE = MergeTree() order by id;

INSERT into  default.test02 (id,col1,col2,create_date) VALUES (4,'1','1','2021-12-31 23:59:59')`

sql:
`select version() as version from test02 group by version order by version

SELECT version() AS version
FROM test02
GROUP BY version
ORDER BY version ASC

Query id: e0eb958d-54ac-4444-9d11-341035adcc02

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.011 sec.`



**Expected behavior**

> get the function result


**Triggering conditions**

1. Use merge tree table engine
2. Do not reference column elements in tables in functions
3. use group by
