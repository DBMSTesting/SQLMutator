Title: "SYSTEM RELOAD DICTIONARY my_dictionary" does not reload immediately
Description:
I have an external dictionary (postgresql). It works nicely!
ClickHouse Server version 19.17.5 revision 54428.

However, after I change a value inside postgres, and run SYSTEM RELOAD DICTIONARY my_dictionary, check in system.dictionaries, the loading_start_time does not change until the preset LIFETIME.

On the other hand, if run SYSTEM RELOAD DICTIONARIES, the loading_start_time changes right away.
