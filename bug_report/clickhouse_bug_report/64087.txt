Title: Got 'TOO LARGE SIZE' when select from odbc table. Is there new settings for this? 
Description:
clickhouse v.24.3.3.102

```
create table mytable
(
    mycolumn String,
    ....
    ....
) engine ODBC(....);

select * from mytable;
--HTTP status code: 500 Internal Server Error, body: ï¿½Code: 49. DB::Exception: Too large size (18446464152236284704) 
--passed to allocator. It indicates an error.: While executing ODBC. (LOGICAL_ERROR),. 
--(RECEIVED_ERROR_FROM_REMOTE_IO_SERVER) (version 24.3.3.102 (official build))
```

But it works when i try to select only less number of columns. Is there new settings for this? 
On v.24.2 it works well
Also, it works well when i select from odbc table function instead of odbc engine
