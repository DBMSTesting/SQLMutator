Title: Materialized view with WITH section is not updating after server restart
Description:
Hi, I'm creating a materialized view using WITH section in query, then I add some data to the underlying table and the view is updated with the new data as expected, but if I restart the server and try to add some more data to the same table, the view is not getting updated. 

Although for regular view (not materialized) or for materialized view without WITH section (just using nested subquery) it works well even after server restarts.

CH version: 22.3.2.1

```sql
create table t (c Int32) engine = TinyLog();

create materialized view mv engine = TinyLog() as
with subquery as (select * from t)
select * from subquery;

insert into t values (1);

select * from t;

┌─c─┐
│ 1 │
└───┘

select * from mv;

┌─c─┐
│ 1 │
└───┘

-- server restart

insert into t values (2);

select * from t;

┌─c─┐
│ 1 │
│ 2 │
└───┘

select * from mv;

┌─c─┐
│ 1 │
└───┘
```
