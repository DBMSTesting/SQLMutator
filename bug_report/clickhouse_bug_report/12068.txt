Title: "Lost connection to MySQL server during query" error for a table with MySQL Engine
Description:
When running a following example query
```
SELECT count()
FROM remote_mysql_table1
WHERE b IN 
(
    SELECT a
    FROM remote_mysql_table2
);
```
where `remote_mysql_table1` and `remote_mysql_table2` are tables with `MySQL` engine, following error can be observed:

The root cause: when running this query, clickhouse establishing two connections to the MySQL server, for a `remote_mysql_table1` and `remote_mysql_table2` tables. Query for `remote_mysql_table2` started to execute, while connection for `remote_mysql_table1` staying in `Writing to net` State, accordingly to MySQL server's processlist. For a connection in this state, `net_write_timeout` parameter comes into play, which is 60s by [default](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_net_write_timeout). Then, if query for `remote_mysql_table2` takes more than `net_write_timeout`, MySQL server closing the connection, then ClickHouse throws an exception.

As a workaround, it's possible to set a relatively high `net_write_timeout`, but there are no guarantee that it will be always enough for all the queries, also, it may lead for keeping a broken connections for a long time.

Possibly it will be better to not to establish MySQL connection in advance, and do that only when query are ready to be executed.

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
20.4.3.16 

Thanks!
