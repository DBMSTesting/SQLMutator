Title: Create table with CTE not working in new version 21.2.2.8
Description:
Just have updated CH to a new version 21.2.2.8 and suddenly the following statement stopped working

```sql
create table t engine = Memory as
with cte as (select * from numbers(10))
select * from cte
```
> DB::Exception: Table default.cte doesn't exist.

Could you kindly revert the old behavior - I liked it.
