Title: NOT_FOUND_COLUMN_IN_BLOCK when using a column multiple time in where 
Description:
This seems to be fixed starting in `23.8` but is an issue in `23.7.5.30`. ( I have not tried more 23.7 to see if any version is okay). 

`23.6.3.87` is also fine so this bug was introduced in `23.7` but got fixed in `23.8`

```
CREATE TABLE issue
(
    `id` UUID,
    `underlying_symbol` LowCardinality(String),
    `price` Decimal(18, 4),
    `option_type` Enum8('call' = 1, 'put' = 2),
    `strike` Decimal(18, 4),
    `underlying_price` Decimal(18, 4)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id;

insert into issue (id, underlying_symbol, price, option_type, strike, underlying_price) values ('8c325f7c-c71f-457f-8abe-5d8a0ae9cc4a', 'MSFT', 0.22, 'call', 342.5, 330.47);

SELECT o0.id FROM issue AS o0 WHERE  (o0.underlying_symbol IN ('MSFT')) AND (o0.option_type = 'call') AND ((o0.underlying_price > 0) AND (((o0.strike > o0.underlying_price) AND (o0.option_type = 'call')) OR ((o0.strike < o0.underlying_price) AND (o0.option_type = 'put')))) ;
