Title: Excessive memory consumption in mutations.
Description:
I think it was already fixed by #9860 (I can recheck after testing build will be published) but right now it reproduces well.
 
```
create table test_mutation_oom engine=MergeTree ORDER BY number as select number, randomPrintableASCII(1024) as logline, '' as string from numbers(10000000);

-- before mutation:
-- sudo pmap $(pidof -s clickhouse-server) | tail -n 1
--  total          3247180K

alter table test_mutation_oom update string = extract(logline, '(a[a-zA-Z]+)') where 1=1;

-- after mutation:
-- sudo pmap $(pidof -s clickhouse-server) | tail -n 1
-- total         27226188K
