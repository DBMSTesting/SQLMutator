Title: While executing ReplacingSorted. (LOGICAL_ERROR) Bug with update click from 23.6 to 23.7
Description:
> We are using clickhouse version 23.6.2.18.

**after upgrading to 23.7.3.14 we stopped having table queries working 
In particular through final (Tables with partitions and primary key Date) After rolling back to version 23.6 the problem went away, but we tested locally on docker and here are the step by step tests: **



```
Received exception from server (version 23.7.4):
Code: 49. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Too large size (9223372036836854775808) passed to allocator. It indicates an error: While executing ReplacingSorted. (LOGICAL_ERROR)
```

**How to reproduce**

* Update clickhouse 23.6 to 23.7
* and run scripts below:

```
CREATE TABLE test
(
    `RowNumber` String,
    `PeriodDate` Date
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
PARTITION BY toYear(PeriodDate)
PRIMARY KEY PeriodDate
ORDER BY (PeriodDate, RowNumber)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192 ; 

insert into test(PeriodDate, RowNumber) SELECT * FROM generateRandom('a Date, d String', 1, 10, 2) where toYear(a) between 2019 and 2024 LIMIT 1000000 SETTINGS max_partitions_per_insert_block = 100000; ```

SELECT
    PeriodDate
FROM test
FINAL
; 
```
If you make a query without FINAL it is executed successfully, thats works only if you type FINAL in queryes
