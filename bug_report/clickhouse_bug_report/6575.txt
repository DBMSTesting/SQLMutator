Title: SQL parsing exception on worker node if the outer query is against distributed table and the scalar subquery contains bitmap function
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**
I have a Clickhouse cluster, with distributed table `dist_cdp_orders_partition_by_day`, and local table `cdp_cust_tag_yzc`, `cdp_orders_partition_by_day`. I open clickhouse-client, connect to 10.126.144.141, issue following SQL:

```
-- ok!
SELECT toDate(order_complete_time) AS day, sum(order_total_sales) AS amount FROM cdp_orders_partition_by_day WHERE bitmapContains((SELECT groupBitmapState(mid_seq) FROM dist_cdp_cust_tag_yzc WHERE gender='男'), mid_seq) GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;

-- error! 
SELECT toDate(order_complete_time) AS day, sum(order_total_sales) AS amount FROM dist_cdp_orders_partition_by_day WHERE bitmapContains((SELECT groupBitmapState(mid_seq) FROM cdp_cust_tag_yzc WHERE gender='男'), mid_seq) GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;
↘ Progress: 279.46 million rows, 1.12 GB (408.36 million rows/s., 1.63 GB/s.)  96%Received exception from server (version 19.11.3):
Code: 62. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Received from 10.126.144.147:9000.

```

The attached 9000.pcap is the capture on host 10.126.144.147 tcp port 9000. The TCP stream indicates that 10.126.144.147 failed to parse the SQL which 10.126.144.141 sent. It was clear that the the bitmap binary in the SQL caused the parsing exception.

* Which ClickHouse server version to use
ClickHouse server version 19.11.3.11, on CentOS 7
* Which interface to use, if matters
clickhouse CLI, version 19.11.3.11
