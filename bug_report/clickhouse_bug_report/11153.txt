Title: Memory limit (total) exceeded issues with wait_end_of_query=1
Description:
Using the version a2ed8267add1cfc28fa2ca17f7227a816921e7d7 in case I run a QUERY like "SELECT 1" in loop using `wait_end_of_query=1` after 7000 iterations all queries will fail with: 
```
DynamicQueryHandler: Code: 241, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Memory limit (total) exceeded: would use 14.40 GiB (attempt to allocate chunk of 4198133 bytes), maximum: 14.40 GiB, Stack trace (when copying this message, always include the lines below):
``` 

If `wait_end_of_query`  is not specified the problem doesn't occur.
