Title: Uninformative error message on ALTER TABLE ADD INDEX with `on cluster` option
Description:
Trying to execute `ALTER TABLE <table_name> on cluster default ADD INDEX <index_name> <column> TYPE minmax GRANULARITY 3;`
Got error `Cannot execute replicated DDL query on leader`, which is not inform, what cause that error.
From docs we know, that ADD INDEX already replicated from the box, so no need in `on cluster` option. It would be nice to get hint on error in that direction.
Thank you!
