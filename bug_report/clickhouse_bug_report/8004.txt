Title: Table dependancies with ALIAS joinGet column
Description:
Haven't provided an example/steps to reproduce but I've noticed that tables that use a joinGet call in an alias column cause the server to fail to startup due to dependency issues. Only work around is to either edit the metadata SQL file and remove the column (then re-add on startup) or move the metadata SQL file out of the way until the source table has loaded then attach it.

Is there a workaround for this?
