Title: optimize_rewrite_sum_if_to_count_if breaks window functions
Description:
```
select
    if(number % 10 = 0, 1, 0) AS dummy,
    sum(dummy) OVER w
FROM numbers(10)
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY number ASC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW);

SET optimize_rewrite_sum_if_to_count_if = 1

-- Received exception from server (version 21.11.1):
-- Code: 215. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Column `number` is not under aggregate function and not in GROUP BY: While processing if((number % 10) = 0, 1, 0) AS dummy, countIf((number % 10) = 0). (NOT_AN_AGGREGATE)

SET optimize_rewrite_sum_if_to_count_if = 0

-- works 

```
