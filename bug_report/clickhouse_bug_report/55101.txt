Title: Empty response with http_write_exception_in_output_format and wait_end_of_query
Description:
**Describe the unexpected behaviour**

After including `http_write_exception_in_output_format` as true by default (see https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/52853) ClickHouse has changed its behavior.

Checking the PR description looks like any error is going to be returned as JSON/XML but is not what is happening. Instead of that responses are empty.

Old behavior:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:28123?query=SELECT+number,+throwIf(number>2)+from+system.numbers+format+JSON&http_write_exception_in_output_format=0"
Code: 395. DB::Exception: Value passed to 'throwIf' function is non-zero: while executing 'FUNCTION throwIf(greater(number, 2) :: 2) -> throwIf(greater(number, 2)) UInt8 : 1'. (FUNCTION_THROW_IF_VALUE_IS_NON_ZERO) (version 23.9.1.1761 (official build))
```

New behavior:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:28123?query=SELECT+number,+throwIf(number>2)+from+system.numbers+format+JSON&http_write_exception_in_output_format=1"
```

Could it be that other settings related to printing intermediate results need to be active?
