Title: Create view with CTE not working in new version 21.4.2
Description:
Similar to issue #20187, it appears view also does not work with CTE properly.

```sql
create view v as
with cte as (select * from numbers(10))
select * from cte
```

```

CREATE VIEW v AS
WITH cte AS
    (
        SELECT *
        FROM numbers(10)
    )
SELECT *
FROM cte
