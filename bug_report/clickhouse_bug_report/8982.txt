Title: Unexepected query results because of corrupt table
Description:
Table structure:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movement
(
  `time` DateTime DEFAULT now() CODEC(DoubleDelta, ZSTD),
  `configuration_id` UInt16 CODEC(ZSTD),
  `node_id` UInt16 CODEC(ZSTD)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (configuration_id, lamp_id, time);
```

Query 1:
```
select configuration_id, count(*) from movement where configuration_id=67 group by configuration_id;
Result: 
configuration_id 67, count() 614 226
```
Query 2:
```
select configuration_id, count(*) from movement group by configuration_id;
Result contains:
configuration_id 67, count() 1 376 373
```

Same thing happens when doing `min(time)`:
Query 1 `2020-01-23 00:02:52`
Query 2 `2020-01-07 11:41:59`

After creating a copy of this table using:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movement3
(
  `time` DateTime DEFAULT now() CODEC(DoubleDelta, ZSTD),
  `configuration_id` UInt16 CODEC(ZSTD),
  `lamp_id` UInt16 CODEC(ZSTD)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (configuration_id, lamp_id, time)
insert into movement3 select time, configuration_id, lamp_id from movement;
```
I do get the same results for query 1 and 2. Does this mean that the original table is in a broken state?

If so, how did this happen and how can I detect and fix this?
