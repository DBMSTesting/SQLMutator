Title: ZooKeeperExceptions are not exceptions anymore
Description:
We get network issues quite often in our environment, so I set up an alert which fires when ZooKeeperExceptions in system.events increases. After upgrading to 1.1.54380 it increases by a few hundred every 5 minutes.
The only messages about ZooKeeper in logs are these:
```
<Debug> db.table (StorageReplicatedMergeTree): Removing 1 old parts from ZooKeeper
<Debug> db.table (StorageReplicatedMergeTree): Removed 1 old parts from ZooKeeper. Removing them from filesystem.
```
It seems that the behaviour was changed in 1.1.54371.
Is this a bug or a feature?
