Title: UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER when using expression aliases in CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS
Description:

### Describe what's wrong

When performing a CREATE VIEW or CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statement, if the `AS ...` clause contains an expression-alias style CTE and that alias is later referenced, ClickHouse complains of an UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER (because it treats the identifer as a table reference).

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myview
TO mydestination
AS WITH
    ('foo','bar') AS objects
SELECT
  'foo' as object
WHERE object IN objects
```

yields

```
Received exception from server (version 25.1.3):
Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown expression or table expression identifier `default.objects` in scope WITH ('foo', 'bar') AS objects SELECT 'foo' AS object WHERE object IN (default.objects). (UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER)
(query: CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myview
TO mydestination
AS WITH
    ('foo','bar') AS objects
SELECT
  'foo' as object
WHERE object IN objects)
```

This is true at HEAD as well

### Does it reproduce on the most recent release?

Yes
