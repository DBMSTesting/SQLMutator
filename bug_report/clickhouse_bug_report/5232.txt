Title: Insert empty Date throws parse Exception
Description:
There are large CSV datasets (> 50GB) that have a lot of empty data values, that is, each line could contain several column values delimited by a comma only.

This problem occurs specifically for Date types (`Nullable(Date)`), when the empty value correspond to a Date type column, the error below is thrown:

```
root@0a077fc9ae73:/# clickhouse-client 
ClickHouse client version 19.5.2.6 (official build).
Connecting to localhost:9000 as user default.
Connected to ClickHouse server version 19.5.2 revision 54417.

0a077fc9ae73 :) CREATE TABLE dummy(id Int8, aDate Nullable(Date), other Int8) ENGINE = Log;
0a077fc9ae73 :) quit

root@0a077fc9ae73:/# echo '"1",,"2"' | clickhouse-client --input_format_allow_errors_num=0 --query="INSERT INTO optimizadb.dummy FORMAT CSV"
Code: 38. DB::Exception: Cannot parse date: value is too short: (at row 1)

Row 1:
Column 0,   name: id,    type: Int8,           parsed text: "<DOUBLE QUOTE>1<DOUBLE QUOTE>"
Column 1,   name: aDate, type: Nullable(Date), parsed text: <EMPTY>ERROR

```
Any suggestion about how to workaround this issue would be welcome.

Thanks
