Title: Wrong query result for WHERE (a, b) IN (SELECT (a, b) with *MergeTree
Description:
version 1.1.54371

CREATE TABLE trololo (a String, b String) ENGINE = MergeTree order by a;
INSERT INTO trololo VALUES ('1', '2');

TEST: SELECT * FROM trololo WHERE (a, b) IN (SELECT (a, b) FROM trololo);
**0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.** . <-- expected one row.

WORKAROUND: SELECT * FROM trololo WHERE concat(a, b) IN (SELECT  concat(a, b) FROM trololo);
┌─a─┬─b─┐
│ 1 │ 2 │
└───┴───┘
1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.013 sec

probable consequences of "An index of MergeTree tables is used when IN is applied to a tuple of expressions from the columns of the primary key. "

-----------------------------------
more weird issue: 

CREATE TABLE trololo (a date, b Int, c Int) ENGINE = MergeTree order by (a,b);
INSERT INTO trololo VALUES (0, 1, 3);

SELECT * FROM trololo WHERE (a, b) IN (SELECT (a, b) FROM trololo)
**Code: 169. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: Bad type of Field.**

**second execution (wrong result):**
SELECT * FROM trololo WHERE (a, b) IN (SELECT (a, b) FROM trololo)
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.

third: Ok. 0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
forth: Code: 169. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000, ::1. DB::Exception: Bad type of Field.
