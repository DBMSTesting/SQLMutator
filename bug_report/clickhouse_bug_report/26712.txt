Title: clickhouse-local remote() fails with localhost on default port
Description:
**Describe the bug**

With a clickhouse server running on local at the default port (9000), this should work:
```
$ clickhouse-local -q "SELECT * FROM remote('127.0.0.1:9000', 'system.parts') LIMIT 3;"
Code: 60, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Table system.parts doesn't exist (version 21.7.2.7 (official build))
```

Note that no tables can be accessed, not just system.parts.

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes, 21.7.2.7

**How to reproduce**

* Start a clickhouse server at default port
* Make any query with clickhouse-local to the clickhouse server using the `remote` function

**Expected behavior**

Clickhouse-local should be able to access it, just like clickhouse-client can with the same query.


**Additional context**

The problem only happens when using localhost and the default port. Starting the server at other port works.

The issue seems to be caused by incorrectly treating the address as local instead of as remote. We are working on a PR to fix it.
