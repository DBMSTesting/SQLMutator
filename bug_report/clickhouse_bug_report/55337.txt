Title: Parquet DATE parse to DateTime64(0)
Description:
**Describe the issue**
Recently, we updated from version `23.3.8.21` to `23.8.2.7` and encountered an incompatibility issue.

When inserting data from a Parquet file with a field type of `DATE` into a ClickHouse table where the column is defined as `DateTime64(0)`, the dates are not parsed correctly. Instead, the dates are parsed as Unix timestamps, resulting in incorrect data being inserted.

**How to reproduce**
```sql
CREATE TABLE test
(
    `DATE` DateTime64(0),
    `CREATED_AT` DateTime64(0)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(DATE)
ORDER BY DATE;

INSERT INTO test SELECT *
FROM s3('https://dev-propel.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/temp/dateColumn.snappy.parquet', 'Parquet');

SELECT DATE, CREATED_AT FROM test;
```

Results:
```
1970-01-01 05:21:05	1970-01-01 05:21:36
1970-01-01 05:21:06	1970-01-01 05:21:37
1970-01-01 05:21:07	1970-01-01 05:21:38
```

Expected results:
```
2022-10-01 00:00:00	2022-11-01 00:00:00
2022-10-02 00:00:00	2022-11-02 00:00:00
2022-09-30 00:00:00	2022-10-31 00:00:00
```

* Which ClickHouse server versions are incompatible
It works in the version [23.3.8.21](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/2f413c9e-585f-4f10-8c99-eb0d33c741cd) (See example online).
It is failing since the version [23.4](https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/5c94b07a-5656-4bd5-ba18-7ef2098edf67) (See example online).

**Workaround**
We have made a workaround in our side to prevent continue inserting wrong data.

```sql
INSERT INTO test 
SELECT toDateTime64("DATE", 0), toDateTime64("CREATED_AT", 0) 
FROM s3('https://dev-propel.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/temp/dateColumn.snappy.parquet', 'Parquet', '"DATE" Nullable(Date32), "CREATED_AT" Nullable(Date32)');

SELECT DATE, CREATED_AT FROM test;
```

Result
```
2022-10-01 00:00:00	2022-11-01 00:00:00
2022-10-02 00:00:00	2022-11-02 00:00:00
2022-09-30 00:00:00	2022-10-31 00:00:00
```
