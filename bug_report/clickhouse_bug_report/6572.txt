Title: OPTIMIZE is not cancelled immediately
Description:
[After finding out how to generate secondary indexes](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/6561), I ran

```
OPTIMIZE TABLE xxx FINAL;
```

and went to drink tea. However, when I checked the command status in a few minutes, I saw

```
Timeout exceeded while receiving data from server. Waited for 300 seconds, timeout is 300 seconds.
Cancelling query.
```

The command did not return control back. I waited ~10 minutes and then Ctrl-C it. The server continued to consume 100% CPU for 6 hours, apparently materializing all the indexes. In the end, it deleted them - because the command was canceled due to the timeout! It was a big failure.

So OPTIMIZE was not canceled at once, and I consider this a bug: it makes no sense to heat the air in a server room for 6 hours.

P.S.
I used `--max_execution_time $MANY_SECONDS --http_receive_timeout $MANY_SECONDS --receive_timeout $MANY_SECONDS --idle_connection_timeout $MANY_SECONDS` to do my task. IDK which timeout is required and which is not. How about including this helpful suggestion in the error message above.
