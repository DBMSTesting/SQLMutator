Title: 21.11.2.2 MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
Description:
After upgrading to 21.11.2.2, any complex query will result in this error:

`Code: 241. DB::Exception: Memory limit (total) exceeded: would use 20.66 GiB (attempt to allocate chunk of 4256164 bytes), maximum: -8.00 EiB. (MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED) (version 21.11.2.2 (official build))`

The strange bit is the minus maximum value.

My config (only relevant to memory settings):

`<max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio>2.5</max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio>`
`<max_memory_usage>600000000000</max_memory_usage>`
`
The server has 240GB RAM and a 400GB swap file.

I understand swap file shouldn't be used but my application has 1 particular query that requires about 300GB memory, which is just over my physical memory.

Immediately rolled back to 21.10.2.15 and the issue does not occur any more.
