Title: [Breaking] Timezone config stopped working, v.19.4.1
Description:
Hi,
I just upgraded to `19.4.1 revision 54416` and the timezone setting in the clickhouse-server config is no longer being respected. E.g. I have it configured to `UTC` and running `SELECT now()` returns in the systems timezone. Previously it was returning in `UTC`. 

This broke most broke everything related to times for us.
