Title: Problem with using uniqCombinedMerge in versions from 20.5.x.x
Description:
**uniqCombinedMerge**
Problem while using uniqCombinedMerge function in versions >= 20.5
For example, if you'll generate the HLL state for a few millions unique rows, serialize it to string and then using it in uniqCombinedMerge, then you can see (for some cases) result is 1-3 or about it, instead of a few millions.

**How to reproduce**
* Versions 20.5.x.x and higher (up to the latest version) result is incorrect. Versions 20.4.x.x and lower result is correct.
* We've using ClickHouse in NodeJS via @apla/clickhouse driver (over http). But this is also reproducing in native `clickhouse-client`.
* All settings by default
* `CREATE TABLE table (phone_md5 FixedString(16), id UInt64) ORDER BY id ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree()`
* And try to execute same query in the different versions of ClickHouse by same data.

I can send example of data for reproducing that (by email/telegram, in parquet or native format) personally.
