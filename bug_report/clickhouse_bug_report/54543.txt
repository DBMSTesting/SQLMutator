Title: `ReplicatedMergeTree::waitForQurom` succeeded after quorum has been marked as failed by another server
Description:
> You have to provide the following information whenever possible.

`ReplicatedMergeTree::waitForQurom` failed with a keeper exception raised because of session expiry, then the retry of `waitForQurom` failed because in the meantime another replica marked it as failed as it couldn't find a replica with the necessary part. After when the server retried `waitForQuorum`, it is succeeded, then the insert query succeeded.



Couldn't reproduce.

**Expected behavior**

`waitForQuorum` shouldn't succeed, it should have failed (and thus causing the `INSERT` query to fail).

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
