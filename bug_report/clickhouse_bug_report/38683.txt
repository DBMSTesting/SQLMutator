Title: Exception Not found column in query with group by and with clause
Description:
**How to reproduce**
``` sql
-- create local table on cluster 
CREATE TABLE default.test_alias on cluster preonline_hk5 (`a` Int64, `b` Int64, `c` Int64, `day` Date, `rtime` DateTime) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{layer}-{shard}/default/test_alias', '{replica}') PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(day) ORDER BY (rtime, a, b, c) TTL day + toIntervalDay(60) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192

-- create distributed table on cluster 
CREATE TABLE default.test_alias_all on cluster preonline_hk5 (`a` Int64, `b` Int64, `c` Int64, `day` Date, `rtime` DateTime) ENGINE = Distributed('preonline_hk5', 'default', 'test_alias', rand())

-- query with group by and with clause
WITH 
    sum(if((a >= 0) AND (b != 100) AND (c = 0), 1, 0)) AS r1, 
    sum(if((a >= 0) AND (b != 100) AND (c > 220), 1, 0)) AS r2 
SELECT 
    (intDiv(toUInt32(rtime), 20) * 20) * 1000 AS t, 
    (r1 * 100) / (r1 + r2) AS m
FROM default.test_alias_all
WHERE day = today()
GROUP BY t
ORDER BY t ASC
``` 

Throw exception: 
```
Received exception from server (version 22.6.1):
Code: 10. DB::Exception: Received from 202.168.117.51:9000. DB::Exception: Not found column countIf(and(greaterOrEquals(a, 0), notEquals(b, 100), equals(c, 0))) in block.
