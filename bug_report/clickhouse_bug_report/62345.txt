**Describe what's wrong**

Time units from second to year return strange results while using `date_trunc` with times before the Unix timestamp (< 1970).
Some of them return 1970-01-01: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/0f8c3b48-252d-43ac-ab23-7b94fc8e6f3e, some of them return strange results: https://fiddle.clickhouse.com/f85fd340-a496-4678-a859-9e66091d58f4.

**Does it reproduce on the most recent release?**

Yes
