Title: ALTER TABLE doesn't work when a fixedString column is part of the WHERE condition
Description:
ClickHouse server version 19.9.2.4.
```
CREATE TABLE 
	default.tca_revision ( 
		trade_date Date,  
		revision_id FixedString(20),  
		instrument LowCardinality(String),  
		side LowCardinality(String),  
		limit UInt32,  
		start_time UInt64,  
		end_time UInt64,  
		state LowCardinality(String),  
		version UInt8,  
		seq_num UInt64 ) 
ENGINE = MergeTree(
	trade_date, 
	(trade_date, revision_id, instrument,seq_num), 8192)

ALTER TABLE tca_revision DELETE WHERE revision_id='000000000523303RVNJ1'

Error: Code: 53, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Types of column 1 in section IN don't match: UInt64 on the right, FixedString(20) on the left.
```

It seems to be a problem related to FixedString type as it works for regular Strings.
