Title: Different results for native and http interfaces.
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

```
clickhouse-client -d database -q 'SELECT stream FROM table WHERE timestamp >= 1637762034 AND timestamp <= 1637859234' | wc -l
1000052
```

```
curl -s -H "X-ClickHouse-User: user" -H "X-ClickHouse-Key: password" -H "X-ClickHouse-Database: database" 'localhost:8123/?query=SELECT+stream+FROM+table+WHERE+timestamp+%3E%3D+1637762034+AND+timestamp+%3C%3D+1637859234' | wc -l
971012
```
(The same result gives a request via go net/http: 971012)

ClickHouse client version 21.11.3.6 (official build).

**How to reproduce**

Make a query that displays more than 100K lines through the native interface and http. Count the number of lines in the answer in both cases.

**Expected behavior**

The same number of lines in the response for native and http.

**Additional context**

The first 10 lines (head - n 10) are the same for both interfaces.
