Title: 21.7 Parameterized views do not work anymore
Description:
I suppose it was broken in #24095.
Will it be fixed by #27227 ?
```
CREATE VIEW custom
(
    `name` String
) AS
SELECT name
FROM system.tables
WHERE database = getSetting('custom_db')

Ok.

-- the setting is not passed
SELECT count() FROM custom

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec.
