Title: Hot to fix "Last column should be ColumnNullable"
Description:
Clickhouse Version 20.7.2.30
Interface: HTTP (in case that matters)

We are using a column of type Enum8 to store data. The data is imported from a file to a buffer table and then bulk inserted into the final table. In the sample code, `t_enum` is the final table and `t_source` is the temporary table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_enum
(
    x Enum8('hello' = 1, 'world' = 2)
)
ENGINE = TinyLog;

CREATE TABLE t_source
(
    x Nullable(String)
)
ENGINE = TinyLog;

INSERT INTO t_source (x) VALUES ('hello');

INSERT INTO t_enum(x)
SELECT x from t_source
WHERE x in ('hello', 'world')
```

During Bulk Insert (last statement) the following error occurs: `e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Last column should be ColumnNullable: while converting source column x to destination column x (version 20.7.2.30 (official build))`

The error can be fixed by making `t_enum.x` a `Nullable(Enum8())`. But our application expects the field to not be null. Adding a check for `x is not null` in the insert statement does not help.

How do I fix the issue?
