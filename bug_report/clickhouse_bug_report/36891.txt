Title: unexpected errors with a clash of constant strings in aggregate function and prewhere and join
Description:
```sql
drop table if exists e;

CREATE TABLE e
(   a UInt64, t DateTime )
Engine=MergeTree PARTITION BY toDate(t)
ORDER BY tuple()

insert into e select 0, toDateTime('2020-02-01 12:00:01') + interval number month from numbers(10);

SELECT sumIf( 1, if( 1, toDateTime('2020-01-01 00:00:00', 'UTC'), toDateTime('1970-01-01 00:00:00', 'UTC')) > t )

WHERE  t >= toDateTime('2021-07-19T13:00:00', 'UTC') AND t <= toDateTime('2021-07-19T13:59:59', 'UTC');

works with `set optimize_move_to_prewhere=0;`
