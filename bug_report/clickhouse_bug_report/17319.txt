Title: "Unknown identifier" when executing query with repeating aliases
Description:
**How to reproduce**

Tested on server versions from 20.4.6 to 20.11.3.3.

Given table:
```sql
create temporary table hits (date Date, data Float64) engine=Memory();
```
The following query (note that `data` alias exists as column in a table, in a subquery and in the outer query): 
```sql
SELECT
    subquery1.period AS period,
    if(1=1, 0, subquery1.data1) AS data,
    if(1=1, 0, subquery2.data) AS other_data
FROM 
(
    SELECT date AS period, data AS data1
    FROM hits
) AS subquery1
LEFT JOIN 
(
    SELECT date AS period, data AS data
    FROM hits
) AS subquery2 ON (subquery1.period = subquery2.period)
```
Fails with message:

> Code: 47. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: Unknown identifier: data there are columns: period, data1, 1, equals(1, 1), 0, if(equals(1, 1), 0, data1): While processing period AS period, if(1 = 1, 0, data1) AS data, if(1 = 1, 0, data) AS other_data.

Interestingly, if you just swap the order of lines in the outer query:

```
    if(1=1, 0, subquery2.data) AS other_data,
    if(1=1, 0, subquery1.data1) AS data
```
The query seems to successfully execute.
