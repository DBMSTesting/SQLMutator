Title: Query with broken link cannot be cancelled while reading from S3
Description:
**Describe what's wrong**

When reading data from broken s3 link, the process of reading is stuck for a long time and it's not possible to cancel the query. It's because we check if query is cancelled between processes that were already done, and in this case we cannot check this because the process is never done.

**How to reproduce**

```
SELECT * FROM s3('https://s3queue.clickhouse.com.amazonaws.com/data/*.json', 'JSONEachRow') LIMIT 1
```

**Expected behavior**

The query should be cancelled in the right way without waiting until all retries are done.
