Title: when set max_parallel_replicas=n, count query's result change to n*correct result.
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the bug**
I have as cluster,one distribute node,two local node to consist  a shard.
when set max_parallel_replicas=n,count query'sresult change to n*correct result.
**How to reproduce**
use a replicated table,and one shard has tow or more replicas,then set set max_parallel_replicas=n.
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
20.1.6.30

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
>**select count()from default.iplog;**
>this count result is 387000.
>**then set max_parallel_replicas=2;**
>execute the same query.
>**select count()from default.iplog;**
>this count result is 774000.
**Expected behavior**
why is the result not 387000 but 774000 when  i set max_parallel_replicas=2?Obveriously,the result is the sum of two replicas's count result:387000 +387000 =774000 .
can we select one of the max result or most correct result of replicas?
