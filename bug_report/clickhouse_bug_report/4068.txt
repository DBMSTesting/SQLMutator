Title: CH keeps trying to reload dropped dictionaries if there was an exception while the dictionary still existed
Description:
18.16.1
I created a MySQL dictionary, but the table had not existed yet on the MySQL server.
```
2019.01.14 22:08:57.957391 [ 113 ] {} <Error> ExternalDictionaries: Cannot create external dictionary 'dim_event_age' from config path /etc/clickhouse-server/dict/dim_event_age.xml: Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 1146, e.displayText() = mysqlxx::BadQuery: Table 'ds.dim_event_age' doesn't exist (dwds1:3306), e.what() = mysqlxx::BadQuery
```
I removed the dictionary description from the config file.
The dictionary disappeared from system.dictionaries, but CH was still trying to reload it:
```
2019.01.14 22:09:04.312770 [ 113 ] {} <Error> ExternalDictionaries: Failed reloading 'dim_event_age' external dictionary: Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 1146, e.displayText() = mysqlxx::BadQuery: Table 'ds.dim_event_age' doesn't exist (dwds1:3306), e.what() = mysqlxx::BadQuery
...
2019.01.15 11:15:32.285578 [ 113 ] {} <Error> ExternalDictionaries: Failed reloading 'dim_event_age' external dictionary: Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 1146, e.displayText() = mysqlxx::BadQuery: Table 'ds.dim_event_age' doesn't exist (dwds1:3306), e.what() = mysqlxx::BadQuery
```
When the table was created on the MySQL server, CH crashed:
```
