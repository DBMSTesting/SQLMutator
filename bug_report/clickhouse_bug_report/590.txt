Title: Not found column in distributed table with columnName ALIAS expr
Description:
I have a distributed table:
`CREATE TABLE distributed.events ( 
    createdDate Date,
    column1 String,
    column2 String,
    column4 String ALIAS concat(column1, column2)
) ENGINE = Distributed(cluster, '', events)`

While trying to select data from it:
`SELECT column4 from events`

I'm getting such exception
`DB::Exception: Not found column: column1`

Looking forward for your help.
