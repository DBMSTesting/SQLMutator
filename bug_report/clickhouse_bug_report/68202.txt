Title: With analyzer on restriction joined_subquery_requires_alias is not working
Description:
Version 24.7

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT * FROM 
  (
      SELECT number AS a
      FROM numbers(6,10)
  ) as t
  PASTE JOIN
  (
      SELECT number AS a
      FROM numbers(5)
      ORDER BY a DESC
  ) 
)
FORMAT Pretty;
```
```
   +----+----+
   |  a |  a |
   +----+----+
1. |  6 |  6 |
   +----+----+
2. |  7 |  7 |
   +----+----+
3. |  8 |  8 |
   +----+----+
4. |  9 |  9 |
   +----+----+
5. | 10 | 10 |
   +----+----+
```

When analyzer is off I get an expected exception:
```
Received exception from server (version 24.7.3):
Code: 206. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: No alias for subquery or table function in JOIN (set joined_subquery_requires_alias=0 to disable restriction). While processing ' (SELECT number AS a FROM numbers(5) ORDER BY a DESC)'. (ALIAS_REQUIRED)
```

If I add `as t2` to second SELECT in JOIN I will get the correct result:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT * FROM 
  (
      SELECT number AS a
      FROM numbers(6,10)
  ) as t
  PASTE JOIN
  (
      SELECT number AS a
      FROM numbers(5)
      ORDER BY a DESC
  ) as t2
)
FORMAT Pretty;
```
```
   +----+------+
   |  a | t2.a |
   +----+------+
1. |  6 |    4 |
   +----+------+
2. |  7 |    3 |
   +----+------+
3. |  8 |    2 |
   +----+------+
4. |  9 |    1 |
   +----+------+
5. | 10 |    0 |
   +----+------+
```

Also I get different result with `joined_subquery_requires_alias=0` when analyzer if on and off:
