Title: Did something change about the way merges are scheduled in 24.x?
Description:
Upon upgrading to 24.1 (from 23.11), we noticed a lot of merges getting stuck - never progressing no matter how much we waited. Eventually this filled up all the available slots for merges and they stopped happening at all.

Unfortunately I was not able to troubleshoot further as this is a production system - so we rolled back to 23.11 after confirming that the merge behavior persisted even across reboots.

Is there something significant that was changed in 24.x in the way merges are performed?
