Title: DB::NetException: Host not found: (container Id) - after correct by-name connections
Description:
 
**Describe the bug**
 
I have a program that is intended to perform some consolidation of data and run periodically.
It moves data from "daily" tables to "historical" tables, running OPTIMIZE on them before it. They all are ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree. 
I am running a three-instances cluster that are running full replicas.

I am using `com.ecwid` Clickhouse Client in a Scala application to perform these operations. The instances are running on docker.
I can run a number of operations, but at some point, I find the issue below.
I have tried creating an HttpTransport and from it, a raw or typed client (depending) on every operation, so connection problems should be left out of it or highly reduced.

```
Exception in thread "main" com.ecwid.clickhouse.ClickHouseHttpException: HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error): Code: 210, e.displayText() = DB::NetException: Host not found: 6cf503fe389f (6cf503fe389f:9000) 
```
Clickhouse URL connection string, and server configuration, is domain-based(e.g. `clickhouse-1.mycluster.com,clickhouse-1.mycluster.com,`), not container-id based, like it is suggested here.

What can be causing it to change connection to a container? 
Locally, with a 1-replica cluster, I'm unable to reproduce. Seems to be related to domain name connection.

 (query: ALTER TABLE db.pageviews_data_auxiliary DETACH PARTITION 202008 )
```

Seems to be trying to connect to container, instead of the domain name (clickhouse-1.mydomain.com).
Server config also uses the domain names for internal connection.

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use
`Connected to ClickHouse server version 20.4.5 revision 54434.`

* Which interface to use, if matters

ECWID Clickhouse Client https://github.com/Ecwid/clickhouse-client 

* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
