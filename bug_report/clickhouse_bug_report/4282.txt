Title: DROP PARTITION hangs on v19.1.14
Description:
**Describe the bug**

Dropping partition operations never complete, don't cancel with KILL QUERY, and block other read / write operations on the tables being altered.

Service cannot be stopped and shutdown requires `kill -9`

**How to reproduce**
* Which ClickHouse server version to use: 19.1.6-1 (54413) from Altinity RPM repo
* Which interface to use: `clickhouse-client`
* OS: CentOS 7.4.1708

* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result:

1) Populate table with Kafka engine through materialized view.
2) Select oldest partition from system.parts `WHERE active`:
3) `ALTER TABLE table DROP PARTITION ('2018-09-23','id1');`

**Expected behavior**
With v18.16.1 the partitions dropped with a little extra system load, in 20-30 seconds.

With v19.1.6-1, inserts to table being altered stop, ALTER TABLE cannot be killed, `clickhouse-server` does not respond to service shutdown. ALTER query shows a running state after 30 minutes.

Reverting to v18.16.1 on same cluster allows partition drops to complete in normal time.

**Error message and/or stacktrace**
No exceptions appear logs related to drop partition. Merges appear to continue in background, but inserts do not.
