Title: TTL not dropping data
Description:
I think I have TTL properly configured

```sql
ENGINE = MergeTree 
    PARTITION BY toDate(received_at) 
    ORDER BY received_at 
    TTL received_at + toIntervalDay(1)
```

However my table already contains 13 days of data. 

```
merge_with_ttl_timeout	86400
```

Am I doing something wrong?
