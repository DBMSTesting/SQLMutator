Title: Data discrepancy between MV and source table
Description:
I'v created folloving Material View

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS debug_impressions_date_pub (
    Date Date,
    Hour UInt8,
    PublisherID              UInt64,
    Impressions UInt64
)
ENGINE = SummingMergeTree
PARTITION BY Date
ORDER BY (Date, Hour, PublisherID);
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS debug_impressions_date_pub_view TO debug_impressions_date_pub
AS SELECT
    Date,
    Hour,
    PublisherID,
    Impressions as Impressions
FROM stats_rep;
```

Two queries: one from the original table, the second from MV should return the same result, but in MV the metrics are less for each hour, as if data loss is occurring


```
select
       Date,
       Hour,
       sum(Impressions)
from stats_rep where
                     PublisherID=845 and
Date=today() group by Hour, Date order by Hour desc;
```

```
select
       Date,
       Hour,
       sum(Impressions)
from debug_impressions_date_pub_view where
 PublisherID=845 and
 Date=today() group by Hour, Date order by Hour desc;
```

I noticed that if you leave only the Date and Time in the primary key, then the query results is the same, but adding any third key leads to discrepancies

If I insert historical data - there are also no discrepancies
