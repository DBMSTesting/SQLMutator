Title: Exception: There is no column **.null   **.size0 in the system.replication_queue
Description:
I has a distributed merge tree table, in the system.replication_queue, there are a lot of  parts_to_merge,  which num_tries reaching 1 million times or more. The exception is: Code: 16. DB::Exception: There is no column baseinfo_publish_time.null in the table. (NO_SUCH_COLUMN_IN_TABLE) (version 22.3.5.20).
In the table structure, baseinfo_publish_time is Nullable(Uint64), I never have add column baseinfo_publish_time.null .

Other tables also have this problem, Code: 16. DB::Exception: There is no column sources.size0 in the table. (NO_SUCH_COLUMN_IN_TABLE) (version 22.3.5.20), where the source is Array(UInt32). 

How is this situation caused?  the baseinfo_publish_time or source column didn't have modifyed after create the table.
