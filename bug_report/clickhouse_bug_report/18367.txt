Title: JOIN + PREWHERE = Illegal type of argument #0 'timezone' of function toDateTime
Description:
@filimonov `toDate` does fix it in this place, but it seems that this issue is more global and occurs in different places that throw random errors, using tables from the first example, this query: 

```sql
SELECT toDateTime(foo.server_time, 'UTC')
FROM foo
ANY INNER JOIN bar USING (dimension_1)
WHERE toDate(foo.server_time, 'UTC') <= toDate('2020-04-30')
```

in 19.6.2.11 returns

```sql
┌─toDateTime(server_time, 'UTC')─┐
│            2020-01-01 13:00:00 │
└────────────────────────────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec.
```

in 20.3.10.75 it throws

```
Received exception from server (version 20.3.10):
Code: 44. DB::Exception: Received from clickhouse:9000. DB::Exception: Illegal type of argument #0 'timezone' of function toDateTime, expected const String, got String. 

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.004 sec.
```

For now it seems that `set optimize_move_to_prewhere = 0` is the safer option to avoid these kind of issues :+1:
