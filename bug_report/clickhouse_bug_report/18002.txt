Title: ClickHouse returns http 200 on cluster table creation error
Description:
**Describe the bug**
I use ClickHouse HTTP API and try to create a table on cluster with the wrong column type (or if the table already exists). ClickHouse returns HTTP 200 OK but also returns error in HTTP body (table isn't created). It's unclear.

**How to reproduce**
* ClickHouse version 20.12.3.3 (official build)
* HTTP API

POST:
```
CREATE TABLE "default"."test_driver_1"  
                 ON CLUSTER "mycluster"  
                     (_timestamp DateTime, wrongcolumn Lowcardinality(String)) 
                 ENGINE = ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/default/test_driver_1', '{replica}', _timestamp) 
                 PARTITION BY (toYYYYMM(_timestamp)) 
                 ORDER BY (_timestamp)
```

Response:
HTTP 200 OK
Body:
```
clickhouse2	9000	50	Code: 50, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Unknown data type family: Lowcardinality. Maybe you meant: [\'LowCardinality\'] (version 20.12.3.3 (official build))	3	0

```

**Expected behavior**
HTTP Code 400
