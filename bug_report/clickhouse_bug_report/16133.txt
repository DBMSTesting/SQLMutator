Title: Normalized AST is too deep
Description:
When I want to perform an update operation, such as the following statement

```UPDATE status = 7, sniffer_count = sniffer_count + 1, last_sniffer_start_time = toDateTime('2020-10-19 12:03:37') WHERE (id IN (15649430, 15649435, 15649440, 15649443...```


The following errors will be reported
Code: 167, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Normalized AST is too deep. Maximum: 1000 (version 19.16.4.12)

How can I solve it
