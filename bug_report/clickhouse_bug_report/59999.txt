Title: CountDistinct cannot find column
Description:
(you don't have to strictly follow this form)

**Describe the issue**
This query used to work but now returns Unknown column: total_devtags.
Here is a minimal reproduction.
Note that I've included very similar queries which do work.
With the simplest possible query, there is no problem.

**How to reproduce**
create table tags (dev_tag String) ENGINE = Memory;

insert into tags (*) values ('a');

SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT countDistinct(dev_tag) AS total_devtags
    FROM
    (
        SELECT dev_tag
        FROM
        (
            SELECT *
            FROM tags
        ) AS t
        GROUP BY dev_tag
    ) AS t
)

SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT count(dev_tag) AS total_devtags
    FROM
    (
        SELECT dev_tag
        FROM
        (
            SELECT *
            FROM tags
        ) AS t
        GROUP BY dev_tag
    ) AS t
)

SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT countDistinct(dev_tag) AS total_devtags
    FROM
    (   
        SELECT dev_tag
        FROM
        (   
            SELECT *
            FROM tags
        ) AS t
    ) AS t
)

* Which ClickHouse server versions are incompatible
23.x vs. 22.8

* Which interface to use, if matters
* Non-default settings, if any
* `CREATE TABLE` statements for all tables involved
* Sample data for all these tables, use [clickhouse-obfuscator](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/programs/obfuscator/Obfuscator.cpp#L42-L80) if necessary
* Queries to run that lead to unexpected result
