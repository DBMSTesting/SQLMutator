Title: ARRAY JOIN in Materialized View yields empty values
Description:
**Describe the bug**

A materialized view similiar to the one below does insert rows with all columns populated from array values filled with the default values (empty string, 0 uint64).
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW blub TO foo AS SELECT col1,col2,arycol1,arycol2 FROM
    (SELECT col1,col2,arycol1,arycol2 FROM my_table WHERE length(arycol1) > 0) 
ARRAY JOINT arycol1,arycol2
````

**Does it reproduce on recent release?**

Yes (Version 21.6)

**How to reproduce**

Version 21.6.1.6689 on Linux amd64 (official build)

**Expected behavior**

I could not find any mentioned limitation of using ARRAY JOIN in a materialized view and therefore assumed that it works similiar as when used in 
```sql
INSERT INTO foo AS SELECT ....
```
