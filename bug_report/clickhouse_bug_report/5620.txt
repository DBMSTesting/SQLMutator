Title: join_use_nulls does not work for Array columns.
Description:
Because Array columns cannot be Nullable.
The only solution is to output empty Array instead of NULL - as the `join_use_nulls` setting has no effect for Array columns. The same for all types that not `IDataType::canBeInsideNullable()`.
